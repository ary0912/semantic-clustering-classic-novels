saville england_ st petersburgh dec th you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings i arrived here yesterday and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking i am already far north of london and as i walk in the streets of petersburgh i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks which braces my nerves and fills me with delight do you understand this feeling this breeze which has travelled from the regions towards which i am advancing gives me a foretaste of those icy climes inspirited by this wind of promise my daydreams become more fervent and vivid i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight there margaret the sun is for ever visible its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour therefor with your leave my sister i will put some trust in preceding navigatorsthere snow and frost are banished and sailing over a calm sea we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe its productions and features may be without example as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes what may not be expected in a country of eternal light i may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever i shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man these are my enticements and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat with his holiday mates on an expedition of discovery up his native river but supposing all these conjectures to be false you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all mankind to the last generation by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries to reach which at present so many months are requisite or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet which if at all possible can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my letter and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purposea point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years i have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean through the seas which surround the pole you may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle thomas library my education was neglected yet i was passionately fond of reading these volumes were my study day and night and my familiarity with them increased that regret which i had felt as a child on learning that my fathers dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life these visions faded when i perused for the first time those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven i also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated you are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment but just at that time i inherited the fortune of my cousin and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking i can even now remember the hour from which i dedicated myself to this great enterprise i commenced by inuring my body to hardship i accompanied the whalefishers on several expeditions to the north sea i voluntarily endured cold famine thirst and want of sleep i often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics the theory of medicine and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage twice i actually hired myself as an undermate in a greenland whaler and acquitted myself to admiration i must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness so valuable did he consider my services and now dear margaret do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose my life might have been passed in ease and luxury but i preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path oh that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative my courage and my resolution is firm but my hopes fluctuate and my spirits are often depressed i am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude i am required not only to raise the spirits of others but sometimes to sustain my own when theirs are failing this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia they fly quickly over the snow in their sledges the motion is pleasant and in my opinion far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach the cold is not excessive if you are wrapped in fursa dress which i have already adopted for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins i have no ambition to lose my life on the postroad between st petersburgh and archangel i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks and my intention is to hire a ship there which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner and to engage as many sailors as i think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whalefishing i do not intend to sail until the month of june and when shall i return ah dear sister how can i answer this question if i succeed many many months perhaps years will pass before you and i may meet if i fail you will see me again soon or never farewell my dear excellent margaret heaven shower down blessings on you and save me that i may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness your affectionate brother r walton letter _to mrs saville england_ archangel th march how slowly the time passes here encompassed as i am by frost and snow yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise i have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors those whom i have already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy and the absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil i have no friend margaret when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of success there will be none to participate my joy if i am assailed by disappointment no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection i shall commit my thoughts to paper it is true but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling i desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me whose eyes would reply to mine you may deem me romantic my dear sister but i bitterly feel the want of a friend i have no one near me gentle yet courageous possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind whose tastes are like my own to approve or amend my plans how would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother i am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties but it is a still greater evil to me that i am selfeducated for the first fourteen years of my life i ran wild on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas books of voyages at that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country now i am twentyeight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen it is true that i have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent but they want as the painters call it _keeping_ and i greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind well these are useless complaints i shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean nor even here in archangel among merchants and seamen yet some feelings unallied to the dross of human nature beat even in these rugged bosoms my lieutenant for instance is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise he is madly desirous of glory or rather to word my phrase more characteristically of advancement in his profession he is an englishman and in the midst of national and professional prejudices unsoftened by cultivation retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity i first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel finding that he was unemployed in this city i easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline this circumstance added to his wellknown integrity and dauntless courage made me very desirous to engage him a youth passed in solitude my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage has so refined the groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship i have never believed it to be necessary and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services i heard of him first in rather a romantic manner from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life this briefly is his story some years ago he loved a young russian lady of moderate fortune and having amassed a considerable sum in prizemoney the father of the girl consented to the match he saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony but she was bathed in tears and throwing herself at his feet entreated him to spare her confessing at the same time that she loved another but that he was poor and that her father would never consent to the union my generous friend reassured the suppliant and on being informed of the name of her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit he had already bought a farm with his money on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life but he bestowed the whole on his rival together with the remains of his prizemoney to purchase stock and then himself solicited the young womans father to consent to her marriage with her lover but the old man decidedly refused thinking himself bound in honour to my friend who when he found the father inexorable quitted his country nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations what a noble fellow you will exclaim he is so but then he is wholly uneducated he is as silent as a turk and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him which while it renders his conduct the more astonishing detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command yet do not suppose because i complain a little or because i can conceive a consolation for my toils which i may never know that i am wavering in my resolutions those are as fixed as fate and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation the winter has been dreadfully severe but the spring promises well and it is considered as a remarkably early season so that perhaps i may sail sooner than i expected i shall do nothing rashly you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care i cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation half pleasurable and half fearful with which i am preparing to depart i am going to unexplored regions to the land of mist and snow but i shall kill no albatross therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if i should come back to you as worn and woeful as the ancient mariner you will smile at my allusion but i will disclose a secret i have often attributed my attachment to my passionate enthusiasm for the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets there is something at work in my soul which i do not understand i am practically industriouspainstaking a workman to execute with perseverance and labourbut besides this there is a love for the marvellous a belief in the marvellous intertwined in all my projects which hurries me out of the common pathways of men even to the wild sea and unvisited regions i am about to explore but to return to dearer considerations shall i meet you again after having traversed immense seas and returned by the most southern cape of africa or america i dare not expect such success yet i cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity i may receive your letters on some occasions when i need them most to support my spirits i love you very tenderly remember me with affection should you never hear from me again your affectionate brother robert walton letter _to mrs saville england_ july th my dear sister i write a few lines in haste to say that i am safeand well advanced on my voyage this letter will reach england by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from archangel more fortunate than i who may not see my native land perhaps for many years i am however in good spirits my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing appear to dismay them we have already reached a very high latitude but it is the height of summer and although not so warm as in england the southern gales which blow us speedily towards those shores which i so ardently desire to attain breathe a degree of renovating warmth which i had not expected no incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter one or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record and i shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage adieu my dear margaret be assured that for my own sake as well as yours i will not rashly encounter danger i will be cool persevering and prudent but success _shall_ crown my endeavours wherefore not thus far i have gone tracing a secure way over the pathless seas the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element what can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man my swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus but i must finish heaven bless my beloved sister rw letter _to mrs saville england_ august th so strange an accident has happened to us that i cannot forbear recording it although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession last monday july st we were nearly surrounded by ice which closed in the ship on all sides scarcely leaving her the searoom in which she floated our situation was somewhat dangerous especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog we accordingly lay to hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather about two oclock the mist cleared away and we beheld stretched out in every direction vast and irregular plains of ice which seemed to have no end some of my comrades groaned and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation we perceived a low carriage fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs pass on towards the north at the distance of half a mile a being which had the shape of a man but apparently of gigantic stature sat in the sledge and guided the dogs we watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice this appearance excited our unqualified wonder we were as we believed many hundred miles from any land but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not in reality so distant as we had supposed shut in however by ice it was impossible to follow his track which we had observed with the greatest attention about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea and before night the ice broke and freed our ship we however lay to until the morning fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice i profited of this time to rest for a few hours in the morning however as soon as it was light i went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel apparently talking to someone in the sea it was in fact a sledge like that we had seen before which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice only one dog remained alive but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel he was not as the other traveller seemed to be a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island but a european when i appeared on deck the master said here is our captain and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea on perceiving me the stranger addressed me in english although with a foreign accent before i come on board your vessel said he will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford i replied however that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board good god margaret if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety your surprise would have been boundless his limbs were nearly frozen and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering i never saw a man in so wretched a condition we attempted to carry him into the cabin but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted we accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity as soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup which restored him wonderfully two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak and i often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding when he had in some measure recovered i removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit i never saw a more interesting creature his eyes have generally an expression of wildness and even madness but there are moments when if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service his whole countenance is lighted up as it were with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled but he is generally melancholy and despairing and sometimes he gnashes his teeth as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off the men who wished to ask him a thousand questions but i would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose once however the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom and he replied to seek one who fled from me and did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion yes then i fancy we have seen him for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge with a man in it across the ice this aroused the strangers attention and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon as he called him had pursued soon after when he was alone with me he said i have doubtless excited your curiosity as well as that of these good people but you are too considerate to make inquiries certainly it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine and yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation you have benevolently restored me to life soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge i replied that i could not answer with any degree of certainty for the ice had not broken until near midnight and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time but of this i could not judge from this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger he manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared but i have persuaded him to remain in the cabin for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere i have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him although they have had very little communication with him for my own part i begin to love him as a brother and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion he must have been a noble creature in his better days being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable i said in one of my letters my dear margaret that i should find no friend on the wide ocean yet i have found a man who before his spirit had been broken by misery i should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart i shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals should i have any fresh incidents to record august th my affection for my guest increases every day he excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree how can i see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief he is so gentle yet so wise his mind is so cultivated and when he speaks although his words are culled with the choicest art yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence he is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own yet although unhappy he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others he has frequently conversed with me on mine which i have communicated to him without disguise he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken to secure it i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say with all the fervour that warmed me how gladly i would sacrifice my fortune my existence my every hope to the furtherance of my enterprise one mans life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought for the dominion i should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race as i spoke a dark gloom spread over my listeners countenance at first i perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion he placed his hands before his eyes and my voice quivered and failed me as i beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers a groan burst from his heaving breast i paused at length he spoke in broken accents unhappy man do you share my madness have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught hear me let me reveal my tale and you will dash the cup from your lips such words you may imagine strongly excited my curiosity but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure having conquered the violence of his feelings he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion and quelling the dark tyranny of despair he led me again to converse concerning myself personally he asked me the history of my earlier years the tale was quickly told but it awakened various trains of reflection i spoke of my desire of finding a friend of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing i agree with you replied the stranger we are unfashioned creatures but half made up if one wiser better dearer than ourselvessuch a friend ought to bedo not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures i once had a friend the most noble of human creatures and am entitled therefore to judge respecting friendship you have hope and the world before you and have no cause for despair but ii have lost everything and cannot begin life anew as he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief that touched me to the heart but he was silent and presently retired to his cabin even broken in spirit as he is no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature the starry sky the sea and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth such a man has a double existence he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments yet when he has retired into himself he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him within whose circle no grief or folly ventures will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concerning this divine wanderer you would not if you saw him you have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world and you are therefore somewhat fastidious but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man sometimes i have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person i ever knew i believe it to be an intuitive discernment a quick but neverfailing power of judgment a penetration into the causes of things unequalled for clearness and precision add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soulsubduing music august th yesterday the stranger said to me you may easily perceive captain walton that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes i had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me but you have won me to alter my determination you seek for knowledge and wisdom as i once did and i ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you as mine has been i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you yet when i reflect that you are pursuing the same course exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what i am i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous were we among the tamer scenes of nature i might fear to encounter your unbelief perhaps your ridicule but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the evervaried powers of nature nor can i doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered communication yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes i felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power i expressed these feelings in my answer i thank you he replied for your sympathy but it is useless my fate is nearly fulfilled i wait but for one event and then i shall repose in peace i understand your feeling continued he perceiving that i wished to interrupt him but you are mistaken my friend if thus you will allow me to name you nothing can alter my destiny listen to my history and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined he then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when i should be at leisure this promise drew from me the warmest thanks i have resolved every night when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties to record as nearly as possible in his own words what he has related during the day if i should be engaged i will at least make notes this manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure but to me who know him and who hear it from his own lipswith what interest and sympathy shall i read it in some future day even now as i commence my task his fulltoned voice swells in my ears his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness i see his thin hand raised in animation while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within strange and harrowing must be his story frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked itthus chapter i am by birth a genevese and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic my ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation he was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business he passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family as the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character i cannot refrain from relating them one of his most intimate friends was a merchant who from a flourishing state fell through numerous mischances into poverty this man whose name was beaufort was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence having paid his debts therefore in the most honourable manner he retreated with his daughter to the town of lucerne where he lived unknown and in wretchedness my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances he bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them he lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode overjoyed at this discovery he hastened to the house which was situated in a mean street near the reuss but when he entered misery and despair alone welcomed him beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchants house the interval was consequently spent in inaction his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness incapable of any exertion his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support but caroline beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould and her courage rose to support her in her adversity she procured plain work she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life several months passed in this manner her father grew worse her time was more entirely occupied in attending him her means of subsistence decreased and in the tenth month her father died in her arms leaving her an orphan and a beggar this last blow overcame her and she knelt by beauforts coffin weeping bitterly when my father entered the chamber he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl who committed herself to his care and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation two years after this event caroline became his wife there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection there was a sense of justice in my fathers upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly perhaps during former years he had suffered from the latediscovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth there was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother differing wholly from the doting fondness of age for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of in some degree recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience he strove to shelter her as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind her health and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit had been shaken by what she had gone through during the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders as a restorative for her weakened frame from italy they visited germany and france i their eldest child was born at naples and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles i remained for several years their only child much as they were attached to each other they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me my mothers tender caresses and my fathers smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections i was their plaything and their idol and something bettertheir child the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven whom to bring up to good and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery according as they fulfilled their duties towards me with this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life i received a lesson of patience of charity and of selfcontrol i was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me for a long time i was their only care my mother had much desired to have a daughter but i continued their single offspring when i was about five years old while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy they passed a week on the shores of the lake of como their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor this to my mother was more than a duty it was a necessity a passionremembering what she had suffered and how she had been relievedfor her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate while the number of halfclothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape one day when my father had gone by himself to milan my mother accompanied by me visited this abode she found a peasant and his wife hard working bent down by care and labour distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest she appeared of a different stock the four others were darkeyed hardy little vagrants this child was thin and very fair her hair was the brightest living gold and despite the poverty of her clothing seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head her brow was clear and ample her blue eyes cloudless and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species a being heavensent and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features the peasant woman perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl eagerly communicated her history she was not her child but the daughter of a milanese nobleman her mother was a german and had died on giving her birth the infant had been placed with these good people to nurse they were better off then they had not been long married and their eldest child was but just born the father of their charge was one of those italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of italyone among the _schiavi ognor frementi_ who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country he became the victim of its weakness whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of austria was not known his property was confiscated his child became an orphan and a beggar she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode fairer than a garden rose among darkleaved brambles when my father returned from milan he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cheruba creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills the apparition was soon explained with his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her they were fond of the sweet orphan her presence had seemed a blessing to them but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when providence afforded her such powerful protection they consulted their village priest and the result was that elizabeth lavenza became the inmate of my parents housemy more than sisterthe beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures everyone loved elizabeth the passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became while i shared it my pride and my delight on the evening previous to her being brought to my home my mother had said playfully i have a pretty present for my victortomorrow he shall have it and when on the morrow she presented elizabeth to me as her promised gift i with childish seriousness interpreted her words literally and looked upon elizabeth as minemine to protect love and cherish all praises bestowed on her i received as made to a possession of my own we called each other familiarly by the name of cousin no word no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to memy more than sister since till death she was to be mine only chapter we were brought up together there was not quite a year difference in our ages i need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute harmony was the soul of our companionship and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition but with all my ardour i was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge she busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our swiss home the sublime shapes of the mountains the changes of the seasons tempest and calm the silence of winter and the life and turbulence of our alpine summersshe found ample scope for admiration and delight while my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things i delighted in investigating their causes the world was to me a secret which i desired to divine curiosity earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature gladness akin to rapture as they were unfolded to me are among the earliest sensations i can remember on the birth of a second son my junior by seven years my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country we possessed a house in geneva and a _campagne_ on belrive the eastern shore of the lake at the distance of rather more than a league from the city we resided principally in the latter and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion it was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few i was indifferent therefore to my schoolfellows in general but i united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them henry clerval was the son of a merchant of geneva he was a boy of singular talent and fancy he loved enterprise hardship and even danger for its own sake he was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance he composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure he tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of roncesvalles of the round table of king arthur and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels no human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself my parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence we felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed when i mingled with other families i distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was and gratitude assisted the development of filial love my temper was sometimes violent and my passions vehement but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn and not to learn all things indiscriminately i confess that neither the structure of languages nor the code of governments nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me it was the secrets of heaven and earth that i desired to learn and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical or in its highest sense the physical secrets of the world meanwhile clerval occupied himself so to speak with the moral relations of things the busy stage of life the virtues of heroes and the actions of men were his theme and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species the saintly soul of elizabeth shone like a shrinededicated lamp in our peaceful home her sympathy was ours her smile her soft voice the sweet glance of her celestial eyes were ever there to bless and animate us she was the living spirit of love to soften and attract i might have become sullen in my study rough through the ardour of my nature but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness and clervalcould aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of clerval yet he might not have been so perfectly humane so thoughtful in his generosity so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition i feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self besides in drawing the picture of my early days i also record those events which led by insensible steps to my after tale of misery for when i would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny i find it arise like a mountain river from ignoble and almost forgotten sources but swelling as it proceeded it became the torrent which in its course has swept away all my hopes and joys natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate i desire therefore in this narration to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science when i was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near thonon the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn in this house i chanced to find a volume of the works of cornelius agrippa i opened it with apathy the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm a new light seemed to dawn upon my mind and bounding with joy i communicated my discovery to my father my father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said ah cornelius agrippa my dear victor do not waste your time upon this it is sad trash if instead of this remark my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient because the powers of the latter were chimerical while those of the former were real and practical under such circumstances i should certainly have thrown agrippa aside and have contented my imagination warmed as it was by returning with greater ardour to my former studies it is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin but the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents and i continued to read with the greatest avidity when i returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author and afterwards of paracelsus and albertus magnus i read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself i have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature in spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers i always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied sir isaac newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom i was acquainted appeared even to my boys apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit the untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses the most learned philosopher knew little more he had partially unveiled the face of nature but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery he might dissect anatomise and give names but not to speak of a final cause causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him i had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature and rashly and ignorantly i had repined but here were books and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more i took their word for all that they averred and i became their disciple it may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century but while i followed the routine of education in the schools of geneva i was to a great degree selftaught with regard to my favourite studies my father was not scientific and i was left to struggle with a childs blindness added to a students thirst for knowledge under the guidance of my new preceptors i entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosophers stone and the elixir of life but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention wealth was an inferior object but what glory would attend the discovery if i could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death nor were these my only visions the raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors the fulfilment of which i most eagerly sought and if my incantations were always unsuccessful i attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors and thus for a time i was occupied by exploded systems mingling like an unadept a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning till an accident again changed the current of my ideas when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near belrive when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm it advanced from behind the mountains of jura and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens i remained while the storm lasted watching its progress with curiosity and delight as i stood at the door on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house and so soon as the dazzling light vanished the oak had disappeared and nothing remained but a blasted stump when we visited it the next morning we found the tree shattered in a singular manner it was not splintered by the shock but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood i never beheld anything so utterly destroyed before this i was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity on this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us and excited by this catastrophe he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism which was at once new and astonishing to me all that he said threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa albertus magnus and paracelsus the lords of my imagination but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies it seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known all that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable by one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth i at once gave up my former occupations set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation and entertained the greatest disdain for a wouldbe science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge in this mood of mind i betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations and so worthy of my consideration thus strangely are our souls constructed and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin when i look back it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my lifethe last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies it was thus that i was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution happiness with their disregard it was a strong effort of the spirit of good but it was ineffectual destiny was too potent and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction chapter when i had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that i should become a student at the university of ingolstadt i had hitherto attended the schools of geneva but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that i should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country my departure was therefore fixed at an early date but before the day resolved upon could arrive the first misfortune of my life occurredan omen as it were of my future misery elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever her illness was severe and she was in the greatest danger during her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her she had at first yielded to our entreaties but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced she could no longer control her anxiety she attended her sickbed her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemperelizabeth was saved but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver on the third day my mother sickened her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event on her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her she joined the hands of elizabeth and myself my children she said my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union this expectation will now be the consolation of your father elizabeth my love you must supply my place to my younger children alas i regret that i am taken from you and happy and beloved as i have been is it not hard to quit you all but these are not thoughts befitting me i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world she died calmly and her countenance expressed affection even in death i need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil the void that presents itself to the soul and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance it is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for everthat the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed never more to be heard these are the reflections of the first days but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil then the actual bitterness of grief commences yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection and why should i describe a sorrow which all have felt and must feel the time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity and the smile that plays upon the lips although it may be deemed a sacrilege is not banished my mother was dead but we had still duties which we ought to perform we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized my departure for ingolstadt which had been deferred by these events was now again determined upon i obtained from my father a respite of some weeks it appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose akin to death of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life i was new to sorrow but it did not the less alarm me i was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me and above all i desired to see my sweet elizabeth in some degree consoled she indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all she looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal she devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins never was she so enchanting as at this time when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us she forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget the day of my departure at length arrived clerval spent the last evening with us he had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student but in vain his father was a narrowminded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education he said little but when he spoke i read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce we sat late we could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word farewell it was said and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose each fancying that the other was deceived but when at mornings dawn i descended to the carriage which was to convey me away they were all theremy father again to bless me clerval to press my hand once more my elizabeth to renew her entreaties that i would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend i threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections i who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasurei was now alone in the university whither i was going i must form my own friends and be my own protector my life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances i loved my brothers elizabeth and clerval these were old familiar faces but i believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers such were my reflections as i commenced my journey but as i proceeded my spirits and hopes rose i ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge i had often when at home thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings now my desires were complied with and it would indeed have been folly to repent i had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to ingolstadt which was long and fatiguing at length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes i alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as i pleased the next morning i delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors chanceor rather the evil influence the angel of destruction which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment i turned my reluctant steps from my fathers doorled me first to m krempe professor of natural philosophy he was an uncouth man but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science he asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy i replied carelessly and partly in contempt mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors i had studied the professor stared have you he said really spent your time in studying such nonsense i replied in the affirmative every minute continued m krempe with warmth every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost you have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names good god in what desert land have you lived where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient i little expected in this enlightened and scientific age to find a disciple of albertus magnus and paracelsus my dear sir you must begin your studies entirely anew so saying he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations and that m waldman a fellow professor would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted i returned home not disappointed for i have said that i had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated but i returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape m krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance the teacher therefore did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits in rather a too philosophical and connected a strain perhaps i have given an account of the conclusions i had come to concerning them in my early years as a child i had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science with a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters i had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists besides i had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy it was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power such views although futile were grand but now the scene was changed the ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded i was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at ingolstadt which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode but as the ensuing week commenced i thought of the information which m krempe had given me concerning the lectures and although i could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit i recollected what he had said of m waldman whom i had never seen as he had hitherto been out of town partly from curiosity and partly from idleness i went into the lecturing room which m waldman entered shortly after this professor was very unlike his colleague he appeared about fifty years of age but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence a few grey hairs covered his temples but those at the back of his head were nearly black his person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest i had ever heard he began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers he then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms after having made a few preparatory experiments he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry the terms of which i shall never forget the ancient teachers of this science said he promised impossibilities and performed nothing the modern masters promise very little they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible have indeed performed miracles they penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hidingplaces they ascend into the heavens they have discovered how the blood circulates and the nature of the air we breathe they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers they can command the thunders of heaven mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows such were the professors wordsrather let me say such the words of the fateenounced to destroy me as he went on i felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being chord after chord was sounded and soon my mind was filled with one thought one conception one purpose so much has been done exclaimed the soul of frankensteinmore far more will i achieve treading in the steps already marked i will pioneer a new way explore unknown powers and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation i closed not my eyes that night my internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil i felt that order would thence arise but i had no power to produce it by degrees after the mornings dawn sleep came i awoke and my yesternights thoughts were as a dream there only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which i believed myself to possess a natural talent on the same day i paid m waldman a visit his manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness i gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had given to his fellow professor he heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of cornelius agrippa and paracelsus but without the contempt that m krempe had exhibited he said that these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge they had left to us as an easier task to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light the labours of men of genius however erroneously directed scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind i listened to his statement which was delivered without any presumption or affectation and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists i expressed myself in measured terms with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor without letting escape inexperience in life would have made me ashamed any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours i requested his advice concerning the books i ought to procure i am happy said m waldman to have gained a disciple and if your application equals your ability i have no doubt of your success chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made it is on that account that i have made it my peculiar study but at the same time i have not neglected the other branches of science a man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone if your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist i should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy including mathematics he then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines instructing me as to what i ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when i should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism he also gave me the list of books which i had requested and i took my leave thus ended a day memorable to me it decided my future destiny chapter from this day natural philosophy and particularly chemistry in the most comprehensive sense of the term became nearly my sole occupation i read with ardour those works so full of genius and discrimination which modern inquirers have written on these subjects i attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university and i found even in m krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information combined it is true with a repulsive physiognomy and manners but not on that account the less valuable in m waldman i found a true friend his gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry in a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension my application was at first fluctuating and uncertain it gained strength as i proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst i was yet engaged in my laboratory as i applied so closely it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid my ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students and my proficiency that of the masters professor krempe often asked me with a sly smile how cornelius agrippa went on whilst m waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress two years passed in this manner during which i paid no visit to geneva but was engaged heart and soul in the pursuit of some discoveries which i hoped to make none but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science in other studies you go as far as others have gone before you and there is nothing more to know but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder a mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study and i who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this improved so rapidly that at the end of two years i made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university when i had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at ingolstadt my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements i thought of returning to my friends and my native town when an incident happened that protracted my stay one of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame and indeed any animal endued with life whence i often asked myself did the principle of life proceed it was a bold question and one which has ever been considered as a mystery yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries i revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology unless i had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable to examine the causes of life we must first have recourse to death i became acquainted with the science of anatomy but this was not sufficient i must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors i do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit darkness had no effect upon my fancy and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life which from being the seat of beauty and strength had become food for the worm now i was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnelhouses my attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings i saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted i beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life i saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain i paused examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation as exemplified in the change from life to death and death to life until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon mea light so brilliant and wondrous yet so simple that while i became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated i was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science that i alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret remember i am not recording the vision of a madman the sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which i now affirm is true some miracle might have produced it yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable after days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue i succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life nay more i became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter the astonishment which i had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture after so much time spent in painful labour to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils but this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which i had been progressively led to it were obliterated and i beheld only the result what had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp not that like a magic scene it all opened upon me at once the information i had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as i should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished i was like the arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light i see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express my friend that you expect to be informed of the secret with which i am acquainted that cannot be listen patiently until the end of my story and you will easily perceive why i am reserved upon that subject i will not lead you on unguarded and ardent as i then was to your destruction and infallible misery learn from me if not by my precepts at least by my example how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow when i found so astonishing a power placed within my hands i hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which i should employ it although i possessed the capacity of bestowing animation yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it with all its intricacies of fibres muscles and veins still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour i doubted at first whether i should attempt the creation of a being like myself or one of simpler organization but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man the materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking but i doubted not that i should ultimately succeed i prepared myself for a multitude of reverses my operations might be incessantly baffled and at last my work be imperfect yet when i considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics i was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success nor could i consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability it was with these feelings that i began the creation of a human being as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed i resolved contrary to my first intention to make the being of a gigantic stature that is to say about eight feet in height and proportionably large after having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials i began no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards like a hurricane in the first enthusiasm of success life and death appeared to me ideal bounds which i should first break through and pour a torrent of light into our dark world a new species would bless me as its creator and source many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as i should deserve theirs pursuing these reflections i thought that if i could bestow animation upon lifeless matter i might in process of time although i now found it impossible renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption these thoughts supported my spirits while i pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour my cheek had grown pale with study and my person had become emaciated with confinement sometimes on the very brink of certainty i failed yet still i clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise one secret which i alone possessed was the hope to which i had dedicated myself and the moon gazed on my midnight labours while with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness i pursued nature to her hidingplaces who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as i dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay my limbs now tremble and my eyes swim with the remembrance but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward i seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit it was indeed but a passing trance that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate i had returned to my old habits i collected bones from charnelhouses and disturbed with profane fingers the tremendous secrets of the human frame in a solitary chamber or rather cell at the top of the house and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase i kept my workshop of filthy creation my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment the dissecting room and the slaughterhouse furnished many of my materials and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation whilst still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased i brought my work near to a conclusion the summer months passed while i was thus engaged heart and soul in one pursuit it was a most beautiful season never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature and the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent and whom i had not seen for so long a time i knew my silence disquieted them and i well remembered the words of my father i know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection and we shall hear regularly from you you must pardon me if i regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected i knew well therefore what would be my fathers feelings but i could not tear my thoughts from my employment loathsome in itself but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination i wished as it were to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object which swallowed up every habit of my nature should be completed i then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part but i am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that i should not be altogether free from blame a human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity i do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule if the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix then that study is certainly unlawful that is to say not befitting the human mind if this rule were always observed if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections greece had not been enslaved cæsar would have spared his country america would have been discovered more gradually and the empires of mexico and peru had not been destroyed but i forget that i am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale and your looks remind me to proceed my father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before winter spring and summer passed away during my labours but i did not watch the blossom or the expanding leavessights which before always yielded me supreme delightso deeply was i engrossed in my occupation the leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close and now every day showed me more plainly how well i had succeeded but my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety and i appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment every night i was oppressed by a slow fever and i became nervous to a most painful degree the fall of a leaf startled me and i shunned my fellow creatures as if i had been guilty of a crime sometimes i grew alarmed at the wreck i perceived that i had become the energy of my purpose alone sustained me my labours would soon end and i believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease and i promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete chapter it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld the accomplishment of my toils with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony i collected the instruments of life around me that i might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet it was already one in the morning the rain pattered dismally against the panes and my candle was nearly burnt out when by the glimmer of the halfextinguished light i saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open it breathed hard and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs how can i describe my emotions at this catastrophe or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care i had endeavoured to form his limbs were in proportion and i had selected his features as beautiful beautiful great god his yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath his hair was of a lustrous black and flowing his teeth of a pearly whiteness but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes that seemed almost of the same colour as the dunwhite sockets in which they were set his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips the different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature i had worked hard for nearly two years for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body for this i had deprived myself of rest and health i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation but now that i had finished the beauty of the dream vanished and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created i rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bedchamber unable to compose my mind to sleep at length lassitude succeeded to the tumult i had before endured and i threw myself on the bed in my clothes endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness but it was in vain i slept indeed but i was disturbed by the wildest dreams i thought i saw elizabeth in the bloom of health walking in the streets of ingolstadt delighted and surprised i embraced her but as i imprinted the first kiss on her lips they became livid with the hue of death her features appeared to change and i thought that i held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms a shroud enveloped her form and i saw the graveworms crawling in the folds of the flannel i started from my sleep with horror a cold dew covered my forehead my teeth chattered and every limb became convulsed when by the dim and yellow light of the moon as it forced its way through the window shutters i beheld the wretchthe miserable monster whom i had created he held up the curtain of the bed and his eyes if eyes they may be called were fixed on me his jaws opened and he muttered some inarticulate sounds while a grin wrinkled his cheeks he might have spoken but i did not hear one hand was stretched out seemingly to detain me but i escaped and rushed downstairs i took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabited where i remained during the rest of the night walking up and down in the greatest agitation listening attentively catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which i had so miserably given life oh no mortal could support the horror of that countenance a mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch i had gazed on him while unfinished he was ugly then but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion it became a thing such as even dante could not have conceived i passed the night wretchedly sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that i felt the palpitation of every artery at others i nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness mingled with this horror i felt the bitterness of disappointment dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me and the change was so rapid the overthrow so complete morning dismal and wet at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of ingolstadt its white steeple and clock which indicated the sixth hour the porter opened the gates of the court which had that night been my asylum and i issued into the streets pacing them with quick steps as if i sought to avoid the wretch whom i feared every turning of the street would present to my view i did not dare return to the apartment which i inhabited but felt impelled to hurry on although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky i continued walking in this manner for some time endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind i traversed the streets without any clear conception of where i was or what i was doing my heart palpitated in the sickness of fear and i hurried on with irregular steps not daring to look about me like one who on a lonely road doth walk in fear and dread and having once turned round walks on and turns no more his head because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread coleridges ancient mariner continuing thus i came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped here i paused i knew not why but i remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street as it drew nearer i observed that it was the swiss diligence it stopped just where i was standing and on the door being opened i perceived henry clerval who on seeing me instantly sprung out my dear frankenstein exclaimed he how glad i am to see you how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting nothing could equal my delight on seeing clerval his presence brought back to my thoughts my father elizabeth and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection i grasped his hand and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune i felt suddenly and for the first time during many months calm and serene joy i welcomed my friend therefore in the most cordial manner and we walked towards my college clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to ingolstadt you may easily believe said he how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of bookkeeping and indeed i believe i left him incredulous to the last for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the dutch schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield i have ten thousand florins a year without greek i eat heartily without greek but his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge it gives me the greatest delight to see you but tell me how you left my father brothers and elizabeth very well and very happy only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom by the by i mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself but my dear frankenstein continued he stopping short and gazing full in my face i did not before remark how very ill you appear so thin and pale you look as if you had been watching for several nights you have guessed right i have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that i have not allowed myself sufficient rest as you see but i hope i sincerely hope that all these employments are now at an end and that i am at length free i trembled excessively i could not endure to think of and far less to allude to the occurrences of the preceding night i walked with a quick pace and we soon arrived at my college i then reflected and the thought made me shiver that the creature whom i had left in my apartment might still be there alive and walking about i dreaded to behold this monster but i feared still more that henry should see him entreating him therefore to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs i darted up towards my own room my hand was already on the lock of the door before i recollected myself i then paused and a cold shivering came over me i threw the door forcibly open as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side but nothing appeared i stepped fearfully in the apartment was empty and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest i could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me but when i became assured that my enemy had indeed fled i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval we ascended into my room and the servant presently brought breakfast but i was unable to contain myself it was not joy only that possessed me i felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness and my pulse beat rapidly i was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place i jumped over the chairs clapped my hands and laughed aloud clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival but when he observed me more attentively he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account and my loud unrestrained heartless laughter frightened and astonished him my dear victor cried he what for gods sake is the matter do not laugh in that manner how ill you are what is the cause of all this do not ask me cried i putting my hands before my eyes for i thought i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room _he_ can tell oh save me save me i imagined that the monster seized me i struggled furiously and fell down in a fit poor clerval what must have been his feelings a meeting which he anticipated with such joy so strangely turned to bitterness but i was not the witness of his grief for i was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long long time this was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months during all that time henry was my only nurse i afterwards learned that knowing my fathers advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey and how wretched my sickness would make elizabeth he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder he knew that i could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself and firm in the hope he felt of my recovery he did not doubt that instead of doing harm he performed the kindest action that he could towards them but i was in reality very ill and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life the form of the monster on whom i had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes and i raved incessantly concerning him doubtless my words surprised henry he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination but the pertinacity with which i continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event by very slow degrees and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend i recovered i remember the first time i became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure i perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window it was a divine spring and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence i felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom my gloom disappeared and in a short time i became as cheerful as before i was attacked by the fatal passion dearest clerval exclaimed i how kind how very good you are to me this whole winter instead of being spent in study as you promised yourself has been consumed in my sick room how shall i ever repay you i feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which i have been the occasion but you will forgive me you will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself but get well as fast as you can and since you appear in such good spirits i may speak to you on one subject may i not i trembled one subject what could it be could he allude to an object on whom i dared not even think compose yourself said clerval who observed my change of colour i will not mention it if it agitates you but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting they hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence is that all my dear henry how could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear dear friends whom i love and who are so deserving of my love if this is your present temper my friend you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you it is from your cousin i believe chapter clerval then put the following letter into my hands it was from my own elizabeth my dearest cousin you have been ill very ill and even the constant letters of dear kind henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account you are forbidden to writeto hold a pen yet one word from you dear victor is necessary to calm our apprehensions for a long time i have thought that each post would bring this line and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to ingolstadt i have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey yet how often have i regretted not being able to perform it myself i figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin yet that is over now clerval writes that indeed you are getting better i eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting get welland return to us you will find a happy cheerful home and friends who love you dearly your fathers health is vigorous and he asks but to see you but to be assured that you are well and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance how pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our ernest he is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit he is desirous to be a true swiss and to enter into foreign service but we cannot part with him at least until his elder brother returns to us my uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country but ernest never had your powers of application he looks upon study as an odious fetter his time is spent in the open air climbing the hills or rowing on the lake i fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected little alteration except the growth of our dear children has taken place since you left us the blue lake and snowclad mountainsthey never change and i think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws my trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me and i am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy kind faces around me since you left us but one change has taken place in our little household do you remember on what occasion justine moritz entered our family probably you do not i will relate her history therefore in a few words madame moritz her mother was a widow with four children of whom justine was the third this girl had always been the favourite of her father but through a strange perversity her mother could not endure her and after the death of m moritz treated her very ill my aunt observed this and when justine was twelve years of age prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house the republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised their manners are more refined and moral a servant in geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in france and england justine thus received in our family learned the duties of a servant a condition which in our fortunate country does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being justine you may remember was a great favourite of yours and i recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour one glance from justine could dissipate it for the same reason that ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelicashe looked so frankhearted and happy my aunt conceived a great attachment for her by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended this benefit was fully repaid justine was the most grateful little creature in the world i do not mean that she made any professions i never heard one pass her lips but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt she thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners so that even now she often reminds me of her when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor justine who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection poor justine was very ill but other trials were reserved for her one by one her brothers and sister died and her mother with the exception of her neglected daughter was left childless the conscience of the woman was troubled she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality she was a roman catholic and i believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived accordingly a few months after your departure for ingolstadt justine was called home by her repentant mother poor girl she wept when she quitted our house she was much altered since the death of my aunt grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners which had before been remarkable for vivacity nor was her residence at her mothers house of a nature to restore her gaiety the poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz into a decline which at first increased her irritability but she is now at peace for ever she died on the first approach of cold weather at the beginning of this last winter justine has just returned to us and i assure you i love her tenderly she is very clever and gentle and extremely pretty as i mentioned before her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt i must say also a few words to you my dear cousin of little darling william i wish you could see him he is very tall of his age with sweet laughing blue eyes dark eyelashes and curling hair when he smiles two little dimples appear on each cheek which are rosy with health he has already had one or two little _wives_ but louisa biron is his favourite a pretty little girl of five years of age now dear victor i dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of geneva the pretty miss mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young englishman john melbourne esq her ugly sister manon married m duvillard the rich banker last autumn your favourite schoolfellow louis manoir has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of clerval from geneva but he has already recovered his spirits and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty frenchwoman madame tavernier she is a widow and much older than manoir but she is very much admired and a favourite with everybody i have written myself into better spirits dear cousin but my anxiety returns upon me as i conclude write dearest victorone lineone word will be a blessing to us ten thousand thanks to henry for his kindness his affection and his many letters we are sincerely grateful adieu my cousin take care of yourself and i entreat you write elizabeth lavenza geneva march th dear dear elizabeth i exclaimed when i had read her letter i will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel i wrote and this exertion greatly fatigued me but my convalescence had commenced and proceeded regularly in another fortnight i was able to leave my chamber one of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce clerval to the several professors of the university in doing this i underwent a kind of rough usage ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained ever since the fatal night the end of my labours and the beginning of my misfortunes i had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy when i was otherwise quite restored to health the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms henry saw this and had removed all my apparatus from my view he had also changed my apartment for he perceived that i had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory but these cares of clerval were made of no avail when i visited the professors m waldman inflicted torture when he praised with kindness and warmth the astonishing progress i had made in the sciences he soon perceived that i disliked the subject but not guessing the real cause he attributed my feelings to modesty and changed the subject from my improvement to the science itself with a desire as i evidently saw of drawing me out what could i do he meant to please and he tormented me i felt as if he had placed carefully one by one in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death i writhed under his words yet dared not exhibit the pain i felt clerval whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others declined the subject alleging in excuse his total ignorance and the conversation took a more general turn i thanked my friend from my heart but i did not speak i saw plainly that he was surprised but he never attempted to draw my secret from me and although i loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds yet i could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection but which i feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply m krempe was not equally docile and in my condition at that time of almost insupportable sensitiveness his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of m waldman dn the fellow cried he why m clerval i assure you he has outstript us all ay stare if you please but it is nevertheless true a youngster who but a few years ago believed in cornelius agrippa as firmly as in the gospel has now set himself at the head of the university and if he is not soon pulled down we shall all be out of countenanceay ay continued he observing my face expressive of suffering m frankenstein is modest an excellent quality in a young man young men should be diffident of themselves you know m clerval i was myself when young but that wears out in a very short time m krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me he came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself resolved to pursue no inglorious career he turned his eyes toward the east as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise the persian arabic and sanskrit languages engaged his attention and i was easily induced to enter on the same studies idleness had ever been irksome to me and now that i wished to fly from reflection and hated my former studies i felt great relief in being the fellowpupil with my friend and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists i did not like him attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects for i did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement i read merely to understand their meaning and they well repaid my labours their melancholy is soothing and their joy elevating to a degree i never experienced in studying the authors of any other country when you read their writings life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of rosesin the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy and the fire that consumes your own heart how different from the manly and heroical poetry of greece and rome summer passed away in these occupations and my return to geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn but being delayed by several accidents winter and snow arrived the roads were deemed impassable and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring i felt this delay very bitterly for i longed to see my native town and my beloved friends my return had only been delayed so long from an unwillingness to leave clerval in a strange place before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants the winter however was spent cheerfully and although the spring was uncommonly late when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness the month of may had already commenced and i expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure when henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of ingolstadt that i might bid a personal farewell to the country i had so long inhabited i acceded with pleasure to this proposition i was fond of exercise and clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that i had taken among the scenes of my native country we passed a fortnight in these perambulations my health and spirits had long been restored and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air i breathed the natural incidents of our progress and the conversation of my friend study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellowcreatures and rendered me unsocial but clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart he again taught me to love the aspect of nature and the cheerful faces of children excellent friend how sincerely you did love me and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own a selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses i became the same happy creature who a few years ago loved and beloved by all had no sorrow or care when happy inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations a serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy the present season was indeed divine the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges while those of summer were already in bud i was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off with an invincible burden henry rejoiced in my gaiety and sincerely sympathised in my feelings he exerted himself to amuse me while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul the resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing his conversation was full of imagination and very often in imitation of the persian and arabic writers he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion at other times he repeated my favourite poems or drew me out into arguments which he supported with great ingenuity we returned to our college on a sunday afternoon the peasants were dancing and every one we met appeared gay and happy my own spirits were high and i bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity chapter on my return i found the following letter from my father my dear victor you have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us and i was at first tempted to write only a few lines merely mentioning the day on which i should expect you but that would be a cruel kindness and i dare not do it what would be your surprise my son when you expected a happy and glad welcome to behold on the contrary tears and wretchedness and how victor can i relate our misfortune absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs and how shall i inflict pain on my long absent son i wish to prepare you for the woeful news but i know it is impossible even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings william is deadthat sweet child whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart who was so gentle yet so gay victor he is murdered i will not attempt to console you but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction last thursday may th i my niece and your two brothers went to walk in plainpalais the evening was warm and serene and we prolonged our walk farther than usual it was already dusk before we thought of returning and then we discovered that william and ernest who had gone on before were not to be found we accordingly rested on a seat until they should return presently ernest came and enquired if we had seen his brother he said that he had been playing with him that william had run away to hide himself and that he vainly sought for him and afterwards waited for a long time but that he did not return this account rather alarmed us and we continued to search for him until night fell when elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house he was not there we returned again with torches for i could not rest when i thought that my sweet boy had lost himself and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish about five in the morning i discovered my lovely boy whom the night before i had seen blooming and active in health stretched on the grass livid and motionless the print of the murders finger was on his neck he was conveyed home and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to elizabeth she was very earnest to see the corpse at first i attempted to prevent her but she persisted and entering the room where it lay hastily examined the neck of the victim and clasping her hands exclaimed o god i have murdered my darling child she fainted and was restored with extreme difficulty when she again lived it was only to weep and sigh she told me that that same evening william had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother this picture is gone and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed we have no trace of him at present although our exertions to discover him are unremitted but they will not restore my beloved william come dearest victor you alone can console elizabeth she weeps continually and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death her words pierce my heart we are all unhappy but will not that be an additional motive for you my son to return and be our comforter your dear mother alas victor i now say thank god she did not live to witness the cruel miserable death of her youngest darling come victor not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin but with feelings of peace and gentleness that will heal instead of festering the wounds of our minds enter the house of mourning my friend but with kindness and affection for those who love you and not with hatred for your enemies your affectionate and afflicted father alphonse frankenstein geneva may th clerval who had watched my countenance as i read this letter was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy i at first expressed on receiving news from my friends i threw the letter on the table and covered my face with my hands my dear frankenstein exclaimed henry when he perceived me weep with bitterness are you always to be unhappy my dear friend what has happened i motioned him to take up the letter while i walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation tears also gushed from the eyes of clerval as he read the account of my misfortune i can offer you no consolation my friend said he your disaster is irreparable what do you intend to do to go instantly to geneva come with me henry to order the horses during our walk clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation he could only express his heartfelt sympathy poor william said he dear lovely child he now sleeps with his angel mother who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty but must weep over his untimely loss to die so miserably to feel the murderers grasp how much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence poor little fellow one only consolation have we his friends mourn and weep but he is at rest the pang is over his sufferings are at an end for ever a sod covers his gentle form and he knows no pain he can no longer be a subject for pity we must reserve that for his miserable survivors clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets the words impressed themselves on my mind and i remembered them afterwards in solitude but now as soon as the horses arrived i hurried into a cabriolet and bade farewell to my friend my journey was very melancholy at first i wished to hurry on for i longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends but when i drew near my native town i slackened my progress i could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind i passed through scenes familiar to my youth but which i had not seen for nearly six years how altered every thing might be during that time one sudden and desolating change had taken place but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations which although they were done more tranquilly might not be the less decisive fear overcame me i dared no advance dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble although i was unable to define them i remained two days at lausanne in this painful state of mind i contemplated the lake the waters were placid all around was calm and the snowy mountains the palaces of nature were not changed by degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me and i continued my journey towards geneva the road ran by the side of the lake which became narrower as i approached my native town i discovered more distinctly the black sides of jura and the bright summit of mont blanc i wept like a child dear mountains my own beautiful lake how do you welcome your wanderer your summits are clear the sky and lake are blue and placid is this to prognosticate peace or to mock at my unhappiness i fear my friend that i shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances but they were days of comparative happiness and i think of them with pleasure my country my beloved country who but a native can tell the delight i took in again beholding thy streams thy mountains and more than all thy lovely lake yet as i drew nearer home grief and fear again overcame me night also closed around and when i could hardly see the dark mountains i felt still more gloomily the picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil and i foresaw obscurely that i was destined to become the most wretched of human beings alas i prophesied truly and failed only in one single circumstance that in all the misery i imagined and dreaded i did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish i was destined to endure it was completely dark when i arrived in the environs of geneva the gates of the town were already shut and i was obliged to pass the night at secheron a village at the distance of half a league from the city the sky was serene and as i was unable to rest i resolved to visit the spot where my poor william had been murdered as i could not pass through the town i was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at plainpalais during this short voyage i saw the lightning playing on the summit of mont blanc in the most beautiful figures the storm appeared to approach rapidly and on landing i ascended a low hill that i might observe its progress it advanced the heavens were clouded and i soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops but its violence quickly increased i quitted my seat and walked on although the darkness and storm increased every minute and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head it was echoed from salêve the juras and the alps of savoy vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes illuminating the lake making it appear like a vast sheet of fire then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash the storm as is often the case in switzerland appeared at once in various parts of the heavens the most violent storm hung exactly north of the town over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of belrive and the village of copêt another storm enlightened jura with faint flashes and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the môle a peaked mountain to the east of the lake while i watched the tempest so beautiful yet terrific i wandered on with a hasty step this noble war in the sky elevated my spirits i clasped my hands and exclaimed aloud william dear angel this is thy funeral this thy dirge as i said these words i perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me i stood fixed gazing intently i could not be mistaken a flash of lightning illuminated the object and discovered its shape plainly to me its gigantic stature and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity instantly informed me that it was the wretch the filthy dæmon to whom i had given life what did he there could he be i shuddered at the conception the murderer of my brother no sooner did that idea cross my imagination than i became convinced of its truth my teeth chattered and i was forced to lean against a tree for support the figure passed me quickly and i lost it in the gloom nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child _he_ was the murderer i could not doubt it the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact i thought of pursuing the devil but it would have been in vain for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of mont salêve a hill that bounds plainpalais on the south he soon reached the summit and disappeared i remained motionless the thunder ceased but the rain still continued and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness i revolved in my mind the events which i had until now sought to forget the whole train of my progress toward the creation the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside its departure two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life and was this his first crime alas i had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch whose delight was in carnage and misery had he not murdered my brother no one can conceive the anguish i suffered during the remainder of the night which i spent cold and wet in the open air but i did not feel the inconvenience of the weather my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair i considered the being whom i had cast among mankind and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror such as the deed which he had now done nearly in the light of my own vampire my own spirit let loose from the grave and forced to destroy all that was dear to me day dawned and i directed my steps towards the town the gates were open and i hastened to my fathers house my first thought was to discover what i knew of the murderer and cause instant pursuit to be made but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell a being whom i myself had formed and endued with life had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain i remembered also the nervous fever with which i had been seized just at the time that i dated my creation and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable i well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me i should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity besides the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit even if i were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it and then of what use would be pursuit who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of mont salêve these reflections determined me and i resolved to remain silent it was about five in the morning when i entered my fathers house i told the servants not to disturb the family and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising six years had elapsed passed in a dream but for one indelible trace and i stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my departure for ingolstadt beloved and venerable parent he still remained to me i gazed on the picture of my mother which stood over the mantelpiece it was an historical subject painted at my fathers desire and represented caroline beaufort in an agony of despair kneeling by the coffin of her dead father her garb was rustic and her cheek pale but there was an air of dignity and beauty that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity below this picture was a miniature of william and my tears flowed when i looked upon it while i was thus engaged ernest entered he had heard me arrive and hastened to welcome me welcome my dearest victor said he ah i wish you had come three months ago and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted you come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate yet your presence will i hope revive our father who seems sinking under his misfortune and your persuasions will induce poor elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting selfaccusationspoor william he was our darling and our pride tears unrestrained fell from my brothers eyes a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame before i had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home the reality came on me as a new and a not less terrible disaster i tried to calm ernest i enquired more minutely concerning my father and here i named my cousin she most of all said ernest requires consolation she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother and that made her very wretched but since the murderer has been discovered the murderer discovered good god how can that be who could attempt to pursue him it is impossible one might as well try to overtake the winds or confine a mountainstream with a straw i saw him too he was free last night i do not know what you mean replied my brother in accents of wonder but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery no one would believe it at first and even now elizabeth will not be convinced notwithstanding all the evidence indeed who would credit that justine moritz who was so amiable and fond of all the family could suddenly become so capable of so frightful so appalling a crime justine moritz poor poor girl is she the accused but it is wrongfully every one knows that no one believes it surely ernest no one did at first but several circumstances came out that have almost forced conviction upon us and her own behaviour has been so confused as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that i fear leaves no hope for doubt but she will be tried today and you will then hear all he then related that the morning on which the murder of poor william had been discovered justine had been taken ill and confined to her bed for several days during this interval one of the servants happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer the servant instantly showed it to one of the others who without saying a word to any of the family went to a magistrate and upon their deposition justine was apprehended on being charged with the fact the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner this was a strange tale but it did not shake my faith and i replied earnestly you are all mistaken i know the murderer justine poor good justine is innocent at that instant my father entered i saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully and after we had exchanged our mournful greeting would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster had not ernest exclaimed good god papa victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor william we do also unfortunately replied my father for indeed i had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one i valued so highly my dear father you are mistaken justine is innocent if she is god forbid that she should suffer as guilty she is to be tried today and i hope i sincerely hope that she will be acquitted this speech calmed me i was firmly convinced in my own mind that justine and indeed every human being was guiltless of this murder i had no fear therefore that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her my tale was not one to announce publicly its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar did any one indeed exist except i the creator who would believe unless his senses convinced him in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which i had let loose upon the world we were soon joined by elizabeth time had altered her since i last beheld her it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years there was the same candour the same vivacity but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect she welcomed me with the greatest affection your arrival my dear cousin said she fills me with hope you perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless justine alas who is safe if she be convicted of crime i rely on her innocence as certainly as i do upon my own our misfortune is doubly hard to us we have not only lost that lovely darling boy but this poor girl whom i sincerely love is to be torn away by even a worse fate if she is condemned i never shall know joy more but she will not i am sure she will not and then i shall be happy again even after the sad death of my little william she is innocent my elizabeth said i and that shall be proved fear nothing but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal how kind and generous you are every one else believes in her guilt and that made me wretched for i knew that it was impossible and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing she wept dearest niece said my father dry your tears if she is as you believe innocent rely on the justice of our laws and the activity with which i shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality chapter we passed a few sad hours until eleven oclock when the trial was to commence my father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses i accompanied them to the court during the whole of this wretched mockery of justice i suffered living torture it was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy the other far more dreadfully murdered with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave and i the cause a thousand times rather would i have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to justine but i was absent when it was committed and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me the appearance of justine was calm she was dressed in mourning and her countenance always engaging was rendered by the solemnity of her feelings exquisitely beautiful yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble although gazed on and execrated by thousands for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed she was tranquil yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage when she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us but she quickly recovered herself and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness the trial began and after the advocate against her had stated the charge several witnesses were called several strange facts combined against her which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as i had she had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a marketwoman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found the woman asked her what she did there but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer she returned to the house about eight oclock and when one inquired where she had passed the night she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him when shown the body she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days the picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket and when elizabeth in a faltering voice proved that it was the same which an hour before the child had been missed she had placed round his neck a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court justine was called on for her defence as the trial had proceeded her countenance had altered surprise horror and misery were strongly expressed sometimes she struggled with her tears but when she was desired to plead she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice god knows she said how entirely i am innocent but i do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me i rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me and i hope the character i have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious she then related that by the permission of elizabeth she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at chêne a village situated at about a league from geneva on her return at about nine oclock she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost she was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him when the gates of geneva were shut and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage being unwilling to call up the inhabitants to whom she was well known most of the night she spent here watching towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes some steps disturbed her and she awoke it was dawn and she quitted her asylum that she might again endeavour to find my brother if she had gone near the spot where his body lay it was without her knowledge that she had been bewildered when questioned by the marketwoman was not surprising since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain concerning the picture she could give no account i know continued the unhappy victim how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me but i have no power of explaining it and when i have expressed my utter ignorance i am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket but here also i am checked i believe that i have no enemy on earth and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly did the murderer place it there i know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing or if i had why should he have stolen the jewel to part with it again so soon i commit my cause to the justice of my judges yet i see no room for hope i beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt i must be condemned although i would pledge my salvation on my innocence several witnesses were called who had known her for many years and they spoke well of her but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward elizabeth saw even this last resource her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct about to fail the accused when although violently agitated she desired permission to address the court i am said she the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered or rather his sister for i was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth it may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion but when i see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends i wish to be allowed to speak that i may say what i know of her character i am well acquainted with the accused i have lived in the same house with her at one time for five and at another for nearly two years during all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures she nursed madame frankenstein my aunt in her last illness with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her after which she again lived in my uncles house where she was beloved by all the family she was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother for my own part i do not hesitate to say that notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her i believe and rely on her perfect innocence she had no temptation for such an action as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests if she had earnestly desired it i should have willingly given it to her so much do i esteem and value her a murmur of approbation followed elizabeths simple and powerful appeal but it was excited by her generous interference and not in favour of poor justine on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence charging her with the blackest ingratitude she herself wept as elizabeth spoke but she did not answer my own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial i believed in her innocence i knew it could the dæmon who had i did not for a minute doubt murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy i could not sustain the horror of my situation and when i perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim i rushed out of the court in agony the tortures of the accused did not equal mine she was sustained by innocence but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold i passed a night of unmingled wretchedness in the morning i went to the court my lips and throat were parched i dared not ask the fatal question but i was known and the officer guessed the cause of my visit the ballots had been thrown they were all black and justine was condemned i cannot pretend to describe what i then felt i had before experienced sensations of horror and i have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions but words cannot convey an idea of the heartsickening despair that i then endured the person to whom i addressed myself added that justine had already confessed her guilt that evidence he observed was hardly required in so glaring a case but i am glad of it and indeed none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence be it ever so decisive this was strange and unexpected intelligence what could it mean had my eyes deceived me and was i really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if i disclosed the object of my suspicions i hastened to return home and elizabeth eagerly demanded the result my cousin replied i it is decided as you may have expected all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape but she has confessed this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth who had relied with firmness upon justines innocence alas said she how shall i ever again believe in human goodness justine whom i loved and esteemed as my sister how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile and yet she has committed a murder soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin my father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide yes said elizabeth i will go although she is guilty and you victor shall accompany me i cannot go alone the idea of this visit was torture to me yet i could not refuse we entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld justine sitting on some straw at the farther end her hands were manacled and her head rested on her knees she rose on seeing us enter and when we were left alone with her she threw herself at the feet of elizabeth weeping bitterly my cousin wept also oh justine said she why did you rob me of my last consolation i relied on your innocence and although i was then very wretched i was not so miserable as i am now and do you also believe that i am so very very wicked do you also join with my enemies to crush me to condemn me as a murderer her voice was suffocated with sobs rise my poor girl said elizabeth why do you kneel if you are innocent i am not one of your enemies i believed you guiltless notwithstanding every evidence until i heard that you had yourself declared your guilt that report you say is false and be assured dear justine that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment but your own confession i did confess but i confessed a lie i confessed that i might obtain absolution but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins the god of heaven forgive me ever since i was condemned my confessor has besieged me he threatened and menaced until i almost began to think that i was the monster that he said i was he threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if i continued obdurate dear lady i had none to support me all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition what could i do in an evil hour i subscribed to a lie and now only am i truly miserable she paused weeping and then continued i thought with horror my sweet lady that you should believe your justine whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured and whom you loved was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated dear william dearest blessed child i soon shall see you again in heaven where we shall all be happy and that consoles me going as i am to suffer ignominy and death oh justine forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you why did you confess but do not mourn dear girl do not fear i will proclaim i will prove your innocence i will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers you shall not die you my playfellow my companion my sister perish on the scaffold no no i never could survive so horrible a misfortune justine shook her head mournfully i do not fear to die she said that pang is past god raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst i leave a sad and bitter world and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned i am resigned to the fate awaiting me learn from me dear lady to submit in patience to the will of heaven during this conversation i had retired to a corner of the prison room where i could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me despair who dared talk of that the poor victim who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death felt not as i did such deep and bitter agony i gnashed my teeth and ground them together uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul justine started when she saw who it was she approached me and said dear sir you are very kind to visit me you i hope do not believe that i am guilty i could not answer no justine said elizabeth he is more convinced of your innocence than i was for even when he heard that you had confessed he did not credit it i truly thank him in these last moments i feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness how sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as i am it removes more than half my misfortune and i feel as if i could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you dear lady and your cousin thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself she indeed gained the resignation she desired but i the true murderer felt the neverdying worm alive in my bosom which allowed of no hope or consolation elizabeth also wept and was unhappy but hers also was the misery of innocence which like a cloud that passes over the fair moon for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart i bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish we stayed several hours with justine and it was with great difficulty that elizabeth could tear herself away i wish cried she that i were to die with you i cannot live in this world of misery justine assumed an air of cheerfulness while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice of halfsuppressed emotion farewell sweet lady dearest elizabeth my beloved and only friend may heaven in its bounty bless and preserve you may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer live and be happy and make others so and on the morrow justine died elizabeths heartrending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer my passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them and when i received their cold answers and heard the harsh unfeeling reasoning of these men my purposed avowal died away on my lips thus i might proclaim myself a madman but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim she perished on the scaffold as a murderess from the tortures of my own heart i turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my elizabeth this also was my doing and my fathers woe and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thriceaccursed hands ye weep unhappy ones but these are not your last tears again shall you raise the funeral wail and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard frankenstein your son your kinsman your early muchloved friend he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving youhe bids you weep to shed countless tears happy beyond his hopes if thus inexorable fate be satisfied and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments thus spoke my prophetic soul as torn by remorse horror and despair i beheld those i loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of william and justine the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts chapter nothing is more painful to the human mind than after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear justine died she rested and i was alive the blood flowed freely in my veins but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove sleep fled from my eyes i wandered like an evil spirit for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible and more much more i persuaded myself was yet behind yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue i had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when i should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings now all was blasted instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with selfsatisfaction and from thence to gather promise of new hopes i was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe this state of mind preyed upon my health which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained i shunned the face of man all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me solitude was my only consolationdeep dark deathlike solitude my father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me do you think victor said he that i do not suffer also no one could love a child more than i loved your brothertears came into his eyes as he spokebut is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief it is also a duty owed to yourself for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment or even the discharge of daily usefulness without which no man is fit for society this advice although good was totally inapplicable to my case i should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness and terror its alarm with my other sensations now i could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view about this time we retired to our house at belrive this change was particularly agreeable to me the shutting of the gates regularly at ten oclock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of geneva very irksome to me i was now free often after the rest of the family had retired for the night i took the boat and passed many hours upon the water sometimes with my sails set i was carried by the wind and sometimes after rowing into the middle of the lake i left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections i was often tempted when all was at peace around me and i the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenlyif i except some bat or the frogs whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when i approached the shoreoften i say i was tempted to plunge into the silent lake that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever but i was restrained when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth whom i tenderly loved and whose existence was bound up in mine i thought also of my father and surviving brother should i by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom i had let loose among them at these moments i wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that i might afford them consolation and happiness but that could not be remorse extinguished every hope i had been the author of unalterable evils and i lived in daily fear lest the monster whom i had created should perpetrate some new wickedness i had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past there was always scope for fear so long as anything i loved remained behind my abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived when i thought of him i gnashed my teeth my eyes became inflamed and i ardently wished to extinguish that life which i had so thoughtlessly bestowed when i reflected on his crimes and malice my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation i would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the andes could i when there have precipitated him to their base i wished to see him again that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of william and justine our house was the house of mourning my fathers health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events elizabeth was sad and desponding she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects the first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles when i reflect my dear cousin said she on the miserable death of justine moritz i no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me before i looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that i read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination but now misery has come home and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each others blood yet i am certainly unjust everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures for the sake of a few jewels to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend a child whom she had nursed from its birth and appeared to love as if it had been her own i could not consent to the death of any human being but certainly i should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men but she was innocent i know i feel she was innocent you are of the same opinion and that confirms me alas victor when falsehood can look so like the truth who can assure themselves of certain happiness i feel as if i were walking on the edge of a precipice towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss william and justine were assassinated and the murderer escapes he walks about the world free and perhaps respected but even if i were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes i would not change places with such a wretch i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony i not in deed but in effect was the true murderer elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance and kindly taking my hand said my dearest friend you must calm yourself these events have affected me god knows how deeply but i am not so wretched as you are there is an expression of despair and sometimes of revenge in your countenance that makes me tremble dear victor banish these dark passions remember the friends around you who centre all their hopes in you have we lost the power of rendering you happy ah while we love while we are true to each other here in this land of peace and beauty your native country we may reap every tranquil blessingwhat can disturb our peace and could not such words from her whom i fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart even as she spoke i drew near to her as if in terror lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her thus not the tenderness of friendship nor the beauty of earth nor of heaven could redeem my soul from woe the very accents of love were ineffectual i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate the wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it and to die was but a type of me sometimes i could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek by bodily exercise and by change of place some relief from my intolerable sensations it was during an access of this kind that i suddenly left my home and bending my steps towards the near alpine valleys sought in the magnificence the eternity of such scenes to forget myself and my ephemeral because human sorrows my wanderings were directed towards the valley of chamounix i had visited it frequently during my boyhood six years had passed since then _i_ was a wreck but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes i performed the first part of my journey on horseback i afterwards hired a mule as the more surefooted and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads the weather was fine it was about the middle of the month of august nearly two months after the death of justine that miserable epoch from which i dated all my woe the weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as i plunged yet deeper in the ravine of arve the immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side the sound of the river raging among the rocks and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as omnipotenceand i ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements here displayed in their most terrific guise still as i ascended higher the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains the impetuous arve and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty but it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty alps whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all as belonging to another earth the habitations of another race of beings i passed the bridge of pélissier where the ravine which the river forms opened before me and i began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it soon after i entered the valley of chamounix this valley is more wonderful and sublime but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of servox through which i had just passed the high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries but i saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields immense glaciers approached the road i heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage mont blanc the supreme and magnificent mont blanc raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_ and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley a tingling longlost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey some turn in the road some new object suddenly perceived and recognised reminded me of days gone by and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood the very winds whispered in soothing accents and maternal nature bade me weep no more then again the kindly influence ceased to acti found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection then i spurred on my animal striving so to forget the world my fears and more than all myselfor in a more desperate fashion i alighted and threw myself on the grass weighed down by horror and despair at length i arrived at the village of chamounix exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which i had endured for a short space of time i remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above mont blanc and listening to the rushing of the arve which pursued its noisy way beneath the same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations when i placed my head upon my pillow sleep crept over me i felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion chapter i spent the following day roaming through the valley i stood beside the sources of the arveiron which take their rise in a glacier that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley the abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me the icy wall of the glacier overhung me a few shattered pines were scattered around and the solemn silence of this glorious presencechamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking reverberated along the mountains of the accumulated ice which through the silent working of immutable laws was ever and anon rent and torn as if it had been but a plaything in their hands these sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that i was capable of receiving they elevated me from all littleness of feeling and although they did not remove my grief they subdued and tranquillised it in some degree also they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month i retired to rest at night my slumbers as it were waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which i had contemplated during the day they congregated round me the unstained snowy mountaintop the glittering pinnacle the pine woods and ragged bare ravine the eagle soaring amidst the cloudsthey all gathered round me and bade me be at peace where had they fled when the next morning i awoke all of soulinspiriting fled with sleep and dark melancholy clouded every thought the rain was pouring in torrents and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains so that i even saw not the faces of those mighty friends still i would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats what were rain and storm to me my mule was brought to the door and i resolved to ascend to the summit of montanvert i remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and evermoving glacier had produced upon my mind when i first saw it it had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy the sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life i determined to go without a guide for i was well acquainted with the path and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene the ascent is precipitous but the path is cut into continual and short windings which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain it is a scene terrifically desolate in a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground some entirely destroyed others bent leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees the path as you ascend higher is intersected by ravines of snow down which stones continually roll from above one of them is particularly dangerous as the slightest sound such as even speaking in a loud voice produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker the pines are not tall or luxuriant but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene i looked on the valley beneath vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression i received from the objects around me alas why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute it only renders them more necessary beings if our impulses were confined to hunger thirst and desire we might be nearly free but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us we rest a dream has power to poison sleep we rise one wandring thought pollutes the day we feel conceive or reason laugh or weep embrace fond woe or cast our cares away it is the same for be it joy or sorrow the path of its departure still is free mans yesterday may neer be like his morrow nought may endure but mutability it was nearly noon when i arrived at the top of the ascent for some time i sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice a mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains presently a breeze dissipated the cloud and i descended upon the glacier the surface is very uneven rising like the waves of a troubled sea descending low and interspersed by rifts that sink deep the field of ice is almost a league in width but i spent nearly two hours in crossing it the opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock from the side where i now stood montanvert was exactly opposite at the distance of a league and above it rose mont blanc in awful majesty i remained in a recess of the rock gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene the sea or rather the vast river of ice wound among its dependent mountains whose aerial summits hung over its recesses their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds my heart which was before sorrowful now swelled with something like joy i exclaimed wandering spirits if indeed ye wander and do not rest in your narrow beds allow me this faint happiness or take me as your companion away from the joys of life as i said this i suddenly beheld the figure of a man at some distance advancing towards me with superhuman speed he bounded over the crevices in the ice among which i had walked with caution his stature also as he approached seemed to exceed that of man i was troubled a mist came over my eyes and i felt a faintness seize me but i was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains i perceived as the shape came nearer sight tremendous and abhorred that it was the wretch whom i had created i trembled with rage and horror resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat he approached his countenance bespoke bitter anguish combined with disdain and malignity while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes but i scarcely observed this rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance and i recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt devil i exclaimed do you dare approach me and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head begone vile insect or rather stay that i may trample you to dust and oh that i could with the extinction of your miserable existence restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered i expected this reception said the dæmon all men hate the wretched how then must i be hated who am miserable beyond all living things yet you my creator detest and spurn me thy creature to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us you purpose to kill me how dare you sport thus with life do your duty towards me and i will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind if you will comply with my conditions i will leave them and you at peace but if you refuse i will glut the maw of death until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends abhorred monster fiend that thou art the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes wretched devil you reproach me with your creation come on then that i may extinguish the spark which i so negligently bestowed my rage was without bounds i sprang on him impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another he easily eluded me and said be calm i entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head have i not suffered enough that you seek to increase my misery life although it may only be an accumulation of anguish is dear to me and i will defend it remember thou hast made me more powerful than thyself my height is superior to thine my joints more supple but i will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee i am thy creature and i will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part the which thou owest me oh frankenstein be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone to whom thy justice and even thy clemency and affection is most due remember that i am thy creature i ought to be thy adam but i am rather the fallen angel whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed everywhere i see bliss from which i alone am irrevocably excluded i was benevolent and good misery made me a fiend make me happy and i shall again be virtuous begone i will not hear you there can be no community between you and me we are enemies begone or let us try our strength in a fight in which one must fall how can i move thee will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature who implores thy goodness and compassion believe me frankenstein i was benevolent my soul glowed with love and humanity but am i not alone miserably alone you my creator abhor me what hope can i gather from your fellow creatures who owe me nothing they spurn and hate me the desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge i have wandered here many days the caves of ice which i only do not fear are a dwelling to me and the only one which man does not grudge these bleak skies i hail for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings if the multitude of mankind knew of my existence they would do as you do and arm themselves for my destruction shall i not then hate them who abhor me i will keep no terms with my enemies i am miserable and they shall share my wretchedness yet it is in your power to recompense me and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great that not only you and your family but thousands of others shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage let your compassion be moved and do not disdain me listen to my tale when you have heard that abandon or commiserate me as you shall judge that i deserve but hear me the guilty are allowed by human laws bloody as they are to speak in their own defence before they are condemned listen to me frankenstein you accuse me of murder and yet you would with a satisfied conscience destroy your own creature oh praise the eternal justice of man yet i ask you not to spare me listen to me and then if you can and if you will destroy the work of your hands why do you call to my remembrance i rejoined circumstances of which i shudder to reflect that i have been the miserable origin and author cursed be the day abhorred devil in which you first saw light cursed although i curse myself be the hands that formed you you have made me wretched beyond expression you have left me no power to consider whether i am just to you or not begone relieve me from the sight of your detested form thus i relieve thee my creator he said and placed his hated hands before my eyes which i flung from me with violence thus i take from thee a sight which you abhor still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion by the virtues that i once possessed i demand this from you hear my tale it is long and strange and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations come to the hut upon the mountain the sun is yet high in the heavens before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world you will have heard my story and can decide on you it rests whether i quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin as he said this he led the way across the ice i followed my heart was full and i did not answer him but as i proceeded i weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale i was partly urged by curiosity and compassion confirmed my resolution i had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother and i eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion for the first time also i felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were and that i ought to render him happy before i complained of his wickedness these motives urged me to comply with his demand we crossed the ice therefore and ascended the opposite rock the air was cold and the rain again began to descend we entered the hut the fiend with an air of exultation i with a heavy heart and depressed spirits but i consented to listen and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted he thus began his tale chapter it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my being all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me and i saw felt heard and smelt at the same time and it was indeed a long time before i learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses by degrees i remember a stronger light pressed upon my nerves so that i was obliged to shut my eyes darkness then came over me and troubled me but hardly had i felt this when by opening my eyes as i now suppose the light poured in upon me again i walked and i believe descended but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations before dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me impervious to my touch or sight but i now found that i could wander on at liberty with no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid the light became more and more oppressive to me and the heat wearying me as i walked i sought a place where i could receive shade this was the forest near ingolstadt and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst this roused me from my nearly dormant state and i ate some berries which i found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground i slaked my thirst at the brook and then lying down was overcome by sleep it was dark when i awoke i felt cold also and half frightened as it were instinctively finding myself so desolate before i had quitted your apartment on a sensation of cold i had covered myself with some clothes but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night i was a poor helpless miserable wretch i knew and could distinguish nothing but feeling pain invade me on all sides i sat down and wept soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure i started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees the moon i gazed with a kind of wonder it moved slowly but it enlightened my path and i again went out in search of berries i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak with which i covered myself and sat down upon the ground no distinct ideas occupied my mind all was confused i felt light and hunger and thirst and darkness innumerable sounds rang in my ears and on all sides various scents saluted me the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure several changes of day and night passed and the orb of night had greatly lessened when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage i was delighted when i first discovered that a pleasant sound which often saluted my ears proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes i began also to observe with greater accuracy the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again the moon had disappeared from the night and again with a lessened form showed itself while i still remained in the forest my sensations had by this time become distinct and my mind received every day additional ideas my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms i distinguished the insect from the herb and by degrees one herb from another i found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing one day when i was oppressed by cold i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain how strange i thought that the same cause should produce such opposite effects i examined the materials of the fire and to my joy found it to be composed of wood i quickly collected some branches but they were wet and would not burn i was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire the wet wood which i had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed i reflected on this and by touching the various branches i discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood that i might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire when night came on and brought sleep with it i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished i covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it and then spreading my cloak i lay on the ground and sank into sleep it was morning when i awoke and my first care was to visit the fire i uncovered it and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame i observed this also and contrived a fan of branches which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished when night came again i found with pleasure that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food for i found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees i tried therefore to dress my food in the same manner placing it on the live embers i found that the berries were spoiled by this operation and the nuts and roots much improved food however became scarce and i often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger when i found this i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited to seek for one where the few wants i experienced would be more easily satisfied in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it and wrapping myself up in my cloak i struck across the wood towards the setting sun i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country a great fall of snow had taken place the night before and the fields were of one uniform white the appearance was disconsolate and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground it was about seven in the morning and i longed to obtain food and shelter at length i perceived a small hut on a rising ground which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd this was a new sight to me and i examined the structure with great curiosity finding the door open i entered an old man sat in it near a fire over which he was preparing his breakfast he turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shrieked loudly and quitting the hut ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable his appearance different from any i had ever before seen and his flight somewhat surprised me but i was enchanted by the appearance of the hut here the snow and rain could not penetrate the ground was dry and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherds breakfast which consisted of bread cheese milk and wine the latter however i did not like then overcome by fatigue i lay down among some straw and fell asleep it was noon when i awoke and allured by the warmth of the sun which shone brightly on the white ground i determined to recommence my travels and depositing the remains of the peasants breakfast in a wallet i found i proceeded across the fields for several hours until at sunset i arrived at a village how miraculous did this appear the huts the neater cottages and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns the vegetables in the gardens the milk and cheese that i saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages allured my appetite one of the best of these i entered but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked and one of the women fainted the whole village was roused some fled some attacked me until grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons i escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel quite bare and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village this hovel however joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance but after my late dearly bought experience i dared not enter it my place of refuge was constructed of wood but so low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it no wood however was placed on the earth which formed the floor but it was dry and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain here then i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter however miserable from the inclemency of the season and still more from the barbarity of man as soon as morning dawned i crept from my kennel that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could remain in the habitation i had found it was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water one part was open and by that i had crept in but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stones and wood yet in such a manner that i might move them on occasion to pass out all the light i enjoyed came through the sty and that was sufficient for me having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw i retired for i saw the figure of a man at a distance and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power i had first however provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread which i purloined and a cup with which i could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat the floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm being thus provided i resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination it was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest my former residence the raindropping branches and dank earth i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step and looking through a small chink i beheld a young creature with a pail on her head passing before my hovel the girl was young and of gentle demeanour unlike what i have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be yet she was meanly dressed a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb her fair hair was plaited but not adorned she looked patient yet sad i lost sight of her and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail which was now partly filled with milk as she walked along seemingly incommoded by the burden a young man met her whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself she followed and they disappeared presently i saw the young man again with some tools in his hand cross the field behind the cottage and the girl was also busied sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard on examining my dwelling i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it but the panes had been filled up with wood in one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate through this crevice a small room was visible whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture in one corner near a small fire sat an old man leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage but presently she took something out of a drawer which employed her hands and she sat down beside the old man who taking up an instrument began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale it was a lovely sight even to me poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion of which the old man took no notice until she sobbed audibly he then pronounced a few sounds and the fair creature leaving her work knelt at his feet he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature they were a mixture of pain and pleasure such as i had never before experienced either from hunger or cold warmth or food and i withdrew from the window unable to bear these emotions soon after this the young man returned bearing on his shoulders a load of wood the girl met him at the door helped to relieve him of his burden and taking some of the fuel into the cottage placed it on the fire then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants which she placed in water and then upon the fire she afterwards continued her work whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots after he had been employed thus about an hour the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together the old man had in the meantime been pensive but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air and they sat down to eat the meal was quickly dispatched the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes leaning on the arm of the youth nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures one was old with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love the younger was slight and graceful in his figure and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency the old man returned to the cottage and the youth with tools different from those he had used in the morning directed his steps across the fields night quickly shut in but to my extreme wonder i found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours in the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which i did not understand and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning so soon as he had finished the youth began not to play but to utter sounds that were monotonous and neither resembling the harmony of the old mans instrument nor the songs of the birds i since found that he read aloud but at that time i knew nothing of the science of words or letters the family after having been thus occupied for a short time extinguished their lights and retired as i conjectured to rest chapter i lay on my straw but i could not sleep i thought of the occurrences of the day what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people and i longed to join them but dared not i remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers and resolved whatever course of conduct i might hereafter think it right to pursue that for the present i would remain quietly in my hovel watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun the young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food and the youth departed after the first meal this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it the young man was constantly employed out of doors and the girl in various laborious occupations within the old man whom i soon perceived to be blind employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion they performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles they were not entirely happy the young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep i saw no cause for their unhappiness but i was deeply affected by it if such lovely creatures were miserable it was less strange that i an imperfect and solitary being should be wretched yet why were these gentle beings unhappy they possessed a delightful house for such it was in my eyes and every luxury they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry they were dressed in excellent clothes and still more they enjoyed one anothers company and speech interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness what did their tears imply did they really express pain i was at first unable to solve these questions but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic a considerable period elapsed before i discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family it was poverty and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow which gave very little during the winter when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it they often i believe suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly especially the two younger cottagers for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves this trait of kindness moved me sensibly i had been accustomed during the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumption but when i found that in doing this i inflicted pain on the cottagers i abstained and satisfied myself with berries nuts and roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood i discovered also another means through which i was enabled to assist their labours i found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire and during the night i often took his tools the use of which i quickly discovered and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days i remember the first time that i did this the young woman when she opened the door in the morning appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside she uttered some words in a loud voice and the youth joined her who also expressed surprise i observed with pleasure that he did not go to the forest that day but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment i found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds i perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain smiles or sadness in the minds and countenances of the hearers this was indeed a godlike science and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it but i was baffled in every attempt i made for this purpose their pronunciation was quick and the words they uttered not having any apparent connection with visible objects i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the mystery of their reference by great application however and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel i discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse i learned and applied the words _fire milk bread_ and _wood_ i learned also the names of the cottagers themselves the youth and his companion had each of them several names but the old man had only one which was _father_ the girl was called _sister_ or _agatha_ and the youth _felix brother_ or _son_ i cannot describe the delight i felt when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them i distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them such as _good dearest unhappy_ i spent the winter in this manner the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me when they were unhappy i felt depressed when they rejoiced i sympathised in their joys i saw few human beings besides them and if any other happened to enter the cottage their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends the old man i could perceive often endeavoured to encourage his children as sometimes i found that he called them to cast off their melancholy he would talk in a cheerful accent with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me agatha listened with respect her eyes sometimes filled with tears which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived but i generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father it was not thus with felix he was always the saddest of the group and even to my unpractised senses he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends but if his countenance was more sorrowful his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister especially when he addressed the old man i could mention innumerable instances which although slight marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers in the midst of poverty and want felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground early in the morning before she had risen he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milkhouse drew water from the well and brought the wood from the outhouse where to his perpetual astonishment he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand in the day i believe he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer because he often went forth and did not return until dinner yet brought no wood with him at other times he worked in the garden but as there was little to do in the frosty season he read to the old man and agatha this reading had puzzled me extremely at first but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked i conjectured therefore that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood and i ardently longed to comprehend these also but how was that possible when i did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs i improved however sensibly in this science but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour for i easily perceived that although i eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers i ought not to make the attempt until i had first become master of their language which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted i had admired the perfect forms of my cottagerstheir grace beauty and delicate complexions but how was i terrified when i viewed myself in a transparent pool at first i started back unable to believe that it was indeed i who was reflected in the mirror and when i became fully convinced that i was in reality the monster that i am i was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification alas i did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer the snow vanished and i beheld the bare trees and the black earth from this time felix was more employed and the heartmoving indications of impending famine disappeared their food as i afterwards found was coarse but it was wholesome and they procured a sufficiency of it several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden which they dressed and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced the old man leaning on his son walked each day at noon when it did not rain as i found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters this frequently took place but a high wind quickly dried the earth and the season became far more pleasant than it had been my mode of life in my hovel was uniform during the morning i attended the motions of the cottagers and when they were dispersed in various occupations i slept the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends when they had retired to rest if there was any moon or the night was starlight i went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage when i returned as often as it was necessary i cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that i had seen done by felix i afterwards found that these labours performed by an invisible hand greatly astonished them and once or twice i heard them on these occasions utter the words _good spirit wonderful_ but i did not then understand the signification of these terms my thoughts now became more active and i longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures i was inquisitive to know why felix appeared so miserable and agatha so sad i thought foolish wretch that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people when i slept or was absent the forms of the venerable blind father the gentle agatha and the excellent felix flitted before me i looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny i formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them and their reception of me i imagined that they would be disgusted until by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words i should first win their favour and afterwards their love these thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language my organs were indeed harsh but supple and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease it was as the ass and the lapdog yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate although his manners were rude deserved better treatment than blows and execration the pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation the birds sang in more cheerful notes and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees happy happy earth fit habitation for gods which so short a time before was bleak damp and unwholesome my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature the past was blotted from my memory the present was tranquil and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy chapter i now hasten to the more moving part of my story i shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which from what i had been have made me what i am spring advanced rapidly the weather became fine and the skies cloudless it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure my senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty it was on one of these days when my cottagers periodically rested from labourthe old man played on his guitar and the children listened to himthat i observed the countenance of felix was melancholy beyond expression he sighed frequently and once his father paused in his music and i conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his sons sorrow felix replied in a cheerful accent and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door it was a lady on horseback accompanied by a countryman as a guide the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil agatha asked a question to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing in a sweet accent the name of felix her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends on hearing this word felix came up hastily to the lady who when she saw him threw up her veil and i beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression her hair of a shining raven black and curiously braided her eyes were dark but gentle although animated her features of a regular proportion and her complexion wondrously fair each cheek tinged with a lovely pink felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her every trait of sorrow vanished from his face and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy of which i could hardly have believed it capable his eyes sparkled as his cheek flushed with pleasure and at that moment i thought him as beautiful as the stranger she appeared affected by different feelings wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes she held out her hand to felix who kissed it rapturously and called her as well as i could distinguish his sweet arabian she did not appear to understand him but smiled he assisted her to dismount and dismissing her guide conducted her into the cottage some conversation took place between him and his father and the young stranger knelt at the old mans feet and would have kissed his hand but he raised her and embraced her affectionately i soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers they made many signs which i did not comprehend but i saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his arabian agatha the evergentle agatha kissed the hands of the lovely stranger and pointing to her brother made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came some hours passed thus while they by their countenances expressed joy the cause of which i did not comprehend presently i found by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them that she was endeavouring to learn their language and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end the stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson most of them indeed were those which i had before understood but i profited by the others as night came on agatha and the arabian retired early when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said good night sweet safie he sat up much longer conversing with his father and by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation i ardently desired to understand them and bent every faculty towards that purpose but found it utterly impossible the next morning felix went out to his work and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished the arabian sat at the feet of the old man and taking his guitar played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes she sang and her voice flowed in a rich cadence swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods when she had finished she gave the guitar to agatha who at first declined it she played a simple air and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger the old man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to explain to safie and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music the days now passed as peaceably as before with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends safie was always gay and happy she and i improved rapidly in the knowledge of language so that in two months i began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers sweet to the scent and the eyes stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods the sun became warmer the nights clear and balmy and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun for i never ventured abroad during daylight fearful of meeting with the same treatment i had formerly endured in the first village which i entered my days were spent in close attention that i might more speedily master the language and i may boast that i improved more rapidly than the arabian who understood very little and conversed in broken accents whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken while i improved in speech i also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight the book from which felix instructed safie was volneys _ruins of empires_ i should not have understood the purport of this book had not felix in reading it given very minute explanations he had chosen this work he said because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors through this work i obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world it gave me an insight into the manners governments and religions of the different nations of the earth i heard of the slothful asiatics of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the grecians of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early romansof their subsequent degeneratingof the decline of that mighty empire of chivalry christianity and kings i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere and wept with safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings was man indeed at once so powerful so virtuous and magnificent yet so vicious and base he appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being to be base and vicious as many on record have been appeared the lowest degradation a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm for a long time i could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow or even why there were laws and governments but when i heard details of vice and bloodshed my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me while i listened to the instructions which felix bestowed upon the arabian the strange system of human society was explained to me i heard of the division of property of immense wealth and squalid poverty of rank descent and noble blood the words induced me to turn towards myself i learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches a man might be respected with only one of these advantages but without either he was considered except in very rare instances as a vagabond and a slave doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few and what was i of my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant but i knew that i possessed no money no friends no kind of property i was besides endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome i was not even of the same nature as man i was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet i bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame my stature far exceeded theirs when i looked around i saw and heard of none like me was i then a monster a blot upon the earth from which all men fled and whom all men disowned i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me i tried to dispel them but sorrow only increased with knowledge oh that i had for ever remained in my native wood nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger thirst and heat of what a strange nature is knowledge it clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock i wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling but i learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain and that was deatha state which i feared yet did not understand i admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers but i was shut out from intercourse with them except through means which i obtained by stealth when i was unseen and unknown and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of becoming one among my fellows the gentle words of agatha and the animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me the mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved felix were not for me miserable unhappy wretch other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply i heard of the difference of sexes and the birth and growth of children how the father doted on the smiles of the infant and the lively sallies of the older child how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge of brother sister and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds but where were my friends and relations no father had watched my infant days no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses or if they had all my past life was now a blot a blind vacancy in which i distinguished nothing from my earliest remembrance i had been as i then was in height and proportion i had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me what was i the question again recurred to be answered only with groans i will soon explain to what these feelings tended but allow me now to return to the cottagers whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation delight and wonder but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors for so i loved in an innocent halfpainful selfdeceit to call them chapter some time elapsed before i learned the history of my friends it was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind unfolding as it did a number of circumstances each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as i was the name of the old man was de lacey he was descended from a good family in france where he had lived for many years in affluence respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals his son was bred in the service of his country and agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction a few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called paris surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue refinement of intellect or taste accompanied by a moderate fortune could afford the father of safie had been the cause of their ruin he was a turkish merchant and had inhabited paris for many years when for some reason which i could not learn he became obnoxious to the government he was seized and cast into prison the very day that safie arrived from constantinople to join him he was tried and condemned to death the injustice of his sentence was very flagrant all paris was indignant and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation felix had accidentally been present at the trial his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court he made at that moment a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means after many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate muhammadan who loaded with chains waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour the turk amazed and delighted endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth felix rejected his offers with contempt yet when he saw the lovely safie who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard the turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety felix was too delicate to accept this offer yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness during the ensuing days while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant the zeal of felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man a servant of her father who understood french she thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate i have copies of these letters for i found means during my residence in the hovel to procure the implements of writing and the letters were often in the hands of felix or agatha before i depart i will give them to you they will prove the truth of my tale but at present as the sun is already far declined i shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you safie related that her mother was a christian arab seized and made a slave by the turks recommended by her beauty she had won the heart of the father of safie who married her the young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother who born in freedom spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced she instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of muhammad this lady died but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of safie who sickened at the prospect of again returning to asia and being immured within the walls of a harem allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements illsuited to the temper of her soul now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue the prospect of marrying a christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her the day for the execution of the turk was fixed but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from paris felix had procured passports in the name of his father sister and himself he had previously communicated his plan to the former who aided the deceit by quitting his house under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself with his daughter in an obscure part of paris felix conducted the fugitives through france to lyons and across mont cenis to leghorn where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the turkish dominions safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure before which time the turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer and felix remained with them in expectation of that event and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the arabian who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection they conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter and sometimes with the interpretation of looks and safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country the turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers while in his heart he had formed far other plans he loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a christian but he feared the resentment of felix if he should appear lukewarm for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which they inhabited he revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed his plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from paris the government of france were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer the plot of felix was quickly discovered and de lacey and agatha were thrown into prison the news reached felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure his blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved this idea was torture to him he quickly arranged with the turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before felix could return to italy safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at leghorn and then quitting the lovely arabian he hastened to paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law hoping to free de lacey and agatha by this proceeding he did not succeed they remained confined for five months before the trial took place the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country they found a miserable asylum in the cottage in germany where i discovered them felix soon learned that the treacherous turk for whom he and his family endured such unheardof oppression on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted italy with his daughter insultingly sending felix a pittance of money to aid him as he said in some plan of future maintenance such were the events that preyed on the heart of felix and rendered him when i first saw him the most miserable of his family he could have endured poverty and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue he gloried in it but the ingratitude of the turk and the loss of his beloved safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable the arrival of the arabian now infused new life into his soul when the news reached leghorn that felix was deprived of his wealth and rank the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover but to prepare to return to her native country the generous nature of safie was outraged by this command she attempted to expostulate with her father but he left her angrily reiterating his tyrannical mandate a few days after the turk entered his daughters apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the french government he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to constantinople for which city he should sail in a few hours he intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property which had not yet arrived at leghorn when alone safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency a residence in turkey was abhorrent to her her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it by some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided she hesitated some time but at length she formed her determination taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money she quitted italy with an attendant a native of leghorn but who understood the common language of turkey and departed for germany she arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of de lacey when her attendant fell dangerously ill safie nursed her with the most devoted affection but the poor girl died and the arabian was left alone unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world she fell however into good hands the italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover chapter such was the history of my beloved cottagers it impressed me deeply i learned from the views of social life which it developed to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind as yet i looked upon crime as a distant evil benevolence and generosity were ever present before me inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed but in giving an account of the progress of my intellect i must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of august of the same year one night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where i collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors i found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books i eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel fortunately the books were written in the language the elements of which i had acquired at the cottage they consisted of _paradise lost_ a volume of _plutarchs lives_ and the _sorrows of werter_ the possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight i now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations i can hardly describe to you the effect of these books they produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings that sometimes raised me to ecstasy but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection in the _sorrows of werter_ besides the interest of its simple and affecting story so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that i found in it a neverending source of speculation and astonishment the gentle and domestic manners it described combined with lofty sentiments and feelings which had for their object something out of self accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom but i thought werter himself a more divine being than i had ever beheld or imagined his character contained no pretension but it sank deep the disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder i did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case yet i inclined towards the opinions of the hero whose extinction i wept without precisely understanding it as i read however i applied much personally to my own feelings and condition i found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom i read and to whose conversation i was a listener i sympathised with and partly understood them but i was unformed in mind i was dependent on none and related to none the path of my departure was free and there was none to lament my annihilation my person was hideous and my stature gigantic what did this mean who was i what was i whence did i come what was my destination these questions continually recurred but i was unable to solve them the volume of _plutarchs lives_ which i possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics this book had a far different effect upon me from the _sorrows of werter_ i learned from werters imaginations despondency and gloom but plutarch taught me high thoughts he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections to admire and love the heroes of past ages many things i read surpassed my understanding and experience i had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms wide extents of country mighty rivers and boundless seas but i was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men the cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which i had studied human nature but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action i read of men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring their species i felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me and abhorrence for vice as far as i understood the signification of those terms relative as they were as i applied them to pleasure and pain alone induced by these feelings i was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers numa solon and lycurgus in preference to romulus and theseus the patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind perhaps if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier burning for glory and slaughter i should have been imbued with different sensations but _paradise lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions i read it as i had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands as a true history it moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent god warring with his creatures was capable of exciting i often referred the several situations as their similarity struck me to my own like adam i was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence but his state was far different from mine in every other respect he had come forth from the hands of god a perfect creature happy and prosperous guarded by the especial care of his creator he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature but i was wretched helpless and alone many times i considered satan as the fitter emblem of my condition for often like him when i viewed the bliss of my protectors the bitter gall of envy rose within me another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings soon after my arrival in the hovel i discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which i had taken from your laboratory at first i had neglected them but now that i was able to decipher the characters in which they were written i began to study them with diligence it was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation you minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences you doubtless recollect these papers here they are everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible i sickened as i read hateful day when i received life i exclaimed in agony accursed creator why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in disgust god in pity made man beautiful and alluring after his own image but my form is a filthy type of yours more horrid even from the very resemblance satan had his companions fellow devils to admire and encourage him but i am solitary and abhorred these were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude but when i contemplated the virtues of the cottagers their amiable and benevolent dispositions i persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity could they turn from their door one however monstrous who solicited their compassion and friendship i resolved at least not to despair but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate i postponed this attempt for some months longer for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest i should fail besides i found that my understanding improved so much with every days experience that i was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity several changes in the meantime took place in the cottage the presence of safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants and i also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there felix and agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation and were assisted in their labours by servants they did not appear rich but they were contented and happy their feelings were serene and peaceful while mine became every day more tumultuous increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast i was i cherished hope it is true but it vanished when i beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine even as that frail image and that inconstant shade i endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months i resolved to undergo and sometimes i allowed my thoughts unchecked by reason to ramble in the fields of paradise and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation but it was all a dream no eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts i was alone i remembered adams supplication to his creator but where was mine he had abandoned me and in the bitterness of my heart i cursed him autumn passed thus i saw with surprise and grief the leaves decay and fall and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when i first beheld the woods and the lovely moon yet i did not heed the bleakness of the weather i was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat but my chief delights were the sight of the flowers the birds and all the gay apparel of summer when those deserted me i turned with more attention towards the cottagers their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer they loved and sympathised with one another and their joys depending on each other were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them the more i saw of them the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition i dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror the poor that stopped at their door were never driven away i asked it is true for greater treasures than a little food or rest i required kindness and sympathy but i did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it the winter advanced and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since i awoke into life my attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors i revolved many projects but that on which i finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone i had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me my voice although harsh had nothing terrible in it i thought therefore that if in the absence of his children i could gain the good will and mediation of the old de lacey i might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors one day when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness although it denied warmth safie agatha and felix departed on a long country walk and the old man at his own desire was left alone in the cottage when his children had departed he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs more sweet and mournful than i had ever heard him play before at first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure but as he continued thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded at length laying aside the instrument he sat absorbed in reflection my heart beat quick this was the hour and moment of trial which would decide my hopes or realise my fears the servants were gone to a neighbouring fair all was silent in and around the cottage it was an excellent opportunity yet when i proceeded to execute my plan my limbs failed me and i sank to the ground again i rose and exerting all the firmness of which i was master removed the planks which i had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat the fresh air revived me and with renewed determination i approached the door of their cottage i knocked who is there said the old man come in i entered pardon this intrusion said i i am a traveller in want of a little rest you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire enter said de lacey and i will try in what manner i can to relieve your wants but unfortunately my children are from home and as i am blind i am afraid i shall find it difficult to procure food for you do not trouble yourself my kind host i have food it is warmth and rest only that i need i sat down and a silence ensued i knew that every minute was precious to me yet i remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview when the old man addressed me by your language stranger i suppose you are my countryman are you french no but i was educated by a french family and understand that language only i am now going to claim the protection of some friends whom i sincerely love and of whose favour i have some hopes are they germans no they are french but let us change the subject i am an unfortunate and deserted creature i look around and i have no relation or friend upon earth these amiable people to whom i go have never seen me and know little of me i am full of fears for if i fail there i am an outcast in the world for ever do not despair to be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate but the hearts of men when unprejudiced by any obvious selfinterest are full of brotherly love and charity rely therefore on your hopes and if these friends are good and amiable do not despair they are kindthey are the most excellent creatures in the world but unfortunately they are prejudiced against me i have good dispositions my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend they behold only a detestable monster that is indeed unfortunate but if you are really blameless cannot you undeceive them i am about to undertake that task and it is on that account that i feel so many overwhelming terrors i tenderly love these friends i have unknown to them been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them but they believe that i wish to injure them and it is that prejudice which i wish to overcome where do these friends reside near this spot the old man paused and then continued if you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale i perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them i am blind and cannot judge of your countenance but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere i am poor and an exile but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature excellent man i thank you and accept your generous offer you raise me from the dust by this kindness and i trust that by your aid i shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures heaven forbid even if you were really criminal for that can only drive you to desperation and not instigate you to virtue i also am unfortunate i and my family have been condemned although innocent judge therefore if i do not feel for your misfortunes how can i thank you my best and only benefactor from your lips first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me i shall be for ever grateful and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom i am on the point of meeting may i know the names and residence of those friends i paused this i thought was the moment of decision which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever i struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength i sank on the chair and sobbed aloud at that moment i heard the steps of my younger protectors i had not a moment to lose but seizing the hand of the old man i cried now is the time save and protect me you and your family are the friends whom i seek do not you desert me in the hour of trial great god exclaimed the old man who are you at that instant the cottage door was opened and felix safie and agatha entered who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me agatha fainted and safie unable to attend to her friend rushed out of the cottage felix darted forward and with supernatural force tore me from his father to whose knees i clung in a transport of fury he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick i could have torn him limb from limb as the lion rends the antelope but my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness and i refrained i saw him on the point of repeating his blow when overcome by pain and anguish i quitted the cottage and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel chapter cursed cursed creator why did i live why in that instant did i not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed i know not despair had not yet taken possession of me my feelings were those of rage and revenge i could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery when night came i quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood and now no longer restrained by the fear of discovery i gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings i was like a wild beast that had broken the toils destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a staglike swiftness oh what a miserable night i passed the cold stars shone in mockery and the bare trees waved their branches above me now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness all save i were at rest or in enjoyment i like the archfiend bore a hell within me and finding myself unsympathised with wished to tear up the trees spread havoc and destruction around me and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin but this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure i became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair there was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me and should i feel kindness towards my enemies no from that moment i declared everlasting war against the species and more than all against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery the sun rose i heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day accordingly i hid myself in some thick underwood determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation the pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity and when i considered what had passed at the cottage i could not help believing that i had been too hasty in my conclusions i had certainly acted imprudently it was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf and i was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children i ought to have familiarised the old de lacey to me and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family when they should have been prepared for my approach but i did not believe my errors to be irretrievable and after much consideration i resolved to return to the cottage seek the old man and by my representations win him to my party these thoughts calmed me and in the afternoon i sank into a profound sleep but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams the horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes the females were flying and the enraged felix tearing me from his fathers feet i awoke exhausted and finding that it was already night i crept forth from my hidingplace and went in search of food when my hunger was appeased i directed my steps towards the wellknown path that conducted to the cottage all there was at peace i crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose that hour passed the sun mounted high in the heavens but the cottagers did not appear i trembled violently apprehending some dreadful misfortune the inside of the cottage was dark and i heard no motion i cannot describe the agony of this suspense presently two countrymen passed by but pausing near the cottage they entered into conversation using violent gesticulations but i did not understand what they said as they spoke the language of the country which differed from that of my protectors soon after however felix approached with another man i was surprised as i knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances do you consider said his companion to him that you will be obliged to pay three months rent and to lose the produce of your garden i do not wish to take any unfair advantage and i beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination it is utterly useless replied felix we can never again inhabit your cottage the life of my father is in the greatest danger owing to the dreadful circumstance that i have related my wife and my sister will never recover from their horror i entreat you not to reason with me any more take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place felix trembled violently as he said this he and his companion entered the cottage in which they remained for a few minutes and then departed i never saw any of the family of de lacey more i continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair my protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world for the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom and i did not strive to control them but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream i bent my mind towards injury and death when i thought of my friends of the mild voice of de lacey the gentle eyes of agatha and the exquisite beauty of the arabian these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me but again when i reflected that they had spurned and deserted me anger returned a rage of anger and unable to injure anything human i turned my fury towards inanimate objects as night advanced i placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden i waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations as the night advanced a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection i lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage my eyes still fixed on the western horizon the edge of which the moon nearly touched a part of its orb was at length hid and i waved my brand it sank and with a loud scream i fired the straw and heath and bushes which i had collected the wind fanned the fire and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues as soon as i was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation i quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods and now with the world before me whither should i bend my steps i resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes but to me hated and despised every country must be equally horrible at length the thought of you crossed my mind i learned from your papers that you were my father my creator and to whom could i apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life among the lessons that felix had bestowed upon safie geography had not been omitted i had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth you had mentioned geneva as the name of your native town and towards this place i resolved to proceed but how was i to direct myself i knew that i must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination but the sun was my only guide i did not know the names of the towns that i was to pass through nor could i ask information from a single human being but i did not despair from you only could i hope for succour although towards you i felt no sentiment but that of hatred unfeeling heartless creator you had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind but on you only had i any claim for pity and redress and from you i determined to seek that justice which i vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form my travels were long and the sufferings i endured intense it was late in autumn when i quitted the district where i had so long resided i travelled only at night fearful of encountering the visage of a human being nature decayed around me and the sun became heatless rain and snow poured around me mighty rivers were frozen the surface of the earth was hard and chill and bare and i found no shelter oh earth how often did i imprecate curses on the cause of my being the mildness of my nature had fled and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness the nearer i approached to your habitation the more deeply did i feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart snow fell and the waters were hardened but i rested not a few incidents now and then directed me and i possessed a map of the country but i often wandered wide from my path the agony of my feelings allowed me no respite no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food but a circumstance that happened when i arrived on the confines of switzerland when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings i generally rested during the day and travelled only when i was secured by night from the view of man one morning however finding that my path lay through a deep wood i ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen the day which was one of the first of spring cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air i felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure that had long appeared dead revive within me half surprised by the novelty of these sensations i allowed myself to be borne away by them and forgetting my solitude and deformity dared to be happy soft tears again bedewed my cheeks and i even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me i continued to wind among the paths of the wood until i came to its boundary which was skirted by a deep and rapid river into which many of the trees bent their branches now budding with the fresh spring here i paused not exactly knowing what path to pursue when i heard the sound of voices that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress i was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where i was concealed laughing as if she ran from someone in sport she continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river when suddenly her foot slipped and she fell into the rapid stream i rushed from my hidingplace and with extreme labour from the force of the current saved her and dragged her to shore she was senseless and i endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation when i was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled on seeing me he darted towards me and tearing the girl from my arms hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood i followed speedily i hardly knew why but when the man saw me draw near he aimed a gun which he carried at my body and fired i sank to the ground and my injurer with increased swiftness escaped into the wood this was then the reward of my benevolence i had saved a human being from destruction and as a recompense i now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone the feelings of kindness and gentleness which i had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth inflamed by pain i vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind but the agony of my wound overcame me my pulses paused and i fainted for some weeks i led a miserable life in the woods endeavouring to cure the wound which i had received the ball had entered my shoulder and i knew not whether it had remained there or passed through at any rate i had no means of extracting it my sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction my daily vows rose for revengea deep and deadly revenge such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish i had endured after some weeks my wound healed and i continued my journey the labours i endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that i was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure but my toils now drew near a close and in two months from this time i reached the environs of geneva it was evening when i arrived and i retired to a hidingplace among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner i should apply to you i was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of jura at this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child who came running into the recess i had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy suddenly as i gazed on him an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity if therefore i could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend i should not be so desolate in this peopled earth urged by this impulse i seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me as soon as he beheld my form he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream i drew his hand forcibly from his face and said child what is the meaning of this i do not intend to hurt you listen to me he struggled violently let me go he cried monster ugly wretch you wish to eat me and tear me to pieces you are an ogre let me go or i will tell my papa boy you will never see your father again you must come with me hideous monster let me go my papa is a syndiche is m frankensteinhe will punish you you dare not keep me frankenstein you belong then to my enemyto him towards whom i have sworn eternal revenge you shall be my first victim the child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart i grasped his throat to silence him and in a moment he lay dead at my feet i gazed on my victim and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph clapping my hands i exclaimed i too can create desolation my enemy is not invulnerable this death will carry despair to him and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him as i fixed my eyes on the child i saw something glittering on his breast i took it it was a portrait of a most lovely woman in spite of my malignity it softened and attracted me for a few moments i gazed with delight on her dark eyes fringed by deep lashes and her lovely lips but presently my rage returned i remembered that i was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance i contemplated would in regarding me have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage i only wonder that at that moment instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony i did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them while i was overcome by these feelings i left the spot where i had committed the murder and seeking a more secluded hidingplace i entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty a woman was sleeping on some straw she was young not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait i held but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health here i thought is one of those whose joyimparting smiles are bestowed on all but me and then i bent over her and whispered awake fairest thy lover is nearhe who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes my beloved awake the sleeper stirred a thrill of terror ran through me should she indeed awake and see me and curse me and denounce the murderer thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me the thought was madness it stirred the fiend within menot i but she shall suffer the murder i have committed because i am for ever robbed of all that she could give me she shall atone the crime had its source in her be hers the punishment thanks to the lessons of felix and the sanguinary laws of man i had learned now to work mischief i bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress she moved again and i fled for some days i haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place sometimes wishing to see you sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever at length i wandered towards these mountains and have ranged through their immense recesses consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify we may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition i am alone and miserable man will not associate with me but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me my companion must be of the same species and have the same defects this being you must create chapter the being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply but i was bewildered perplexed and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition he continued you must create a female for me with whom i can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being this you alone can do and i demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede the latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers and as he said this i could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me i do refuse it i replied and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me you may render me the most miserable of men but you shall never make me base in my own eyes shall i create another like yourself whose joint wickedness might desolate the world begone i have answered you you may torture me but i will never consent you are in the wrong replied the fiend and instead of threatening i am content to reason with you i am malicious because i am miserable am i not shunned and hated by all mankind you my creator would tear me to pieces and triumph remember that and tell me why i should pity man more than he pities me you would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those icerifts and destroy my frame the work of your own hands shall i respect man when he condemns me let him live with me in the interchange of kindness and instead of injury i would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance but that cannot be the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery i will revenge my injuries if i cannot inspire love i will cause fear and chiefly towards you my archenemy because my creator do i swear inextinguishable hatred have a care i will work at your destruction nor finish until i desolate your heart so that you shall curse the hour of your birth a fiendish rage animated him as he said this his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold but presently he calmed himself and proceeded i intended to reason this passion is detrimental to me for you do not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess if any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me i should return them a hundred and a hundredfold for that one creatures sake i would make peace with the whole kind but i now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised what i ask of you is reasonable and moderate i demand a creature of another sex but as hideous as myself the gratification is small but it is all that i can receive and it shall content me it is true we shall be monsters cut off from all the world but on that account we shall be more attached to one another our lives will not be happy but they will be harmless and free from the misery i now feel oh my creator make me happy let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit let me see that i excite the sympathy of some existing thing do not deny me my request i was moved i shuddered when i thought of the possible consequences of my consent but i felt that there was some justice in his argument his tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations and did i not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow he saw my change of feeling and continued if you consent neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again i will go to the vast wilds of south america my food is not that of man i do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment my companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare we shall make our bed of dried leaves the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food the picture i present to you is peaceful and human and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty pitiless as you have been towards me i now see compassion in your eyes let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what i so ardently desire you propose replied i to fly from the habitations of man to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions how can you who long for the love and sympathy of man persevere in this exile you will return and again seek their kindness and you will meet with their detestation your evil passions will be renewed and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction this may not be cease to argue the point for i cannot consent how inconstant are your feelings but a moment ago you were moved by my representations and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints i swear to you by the earth which i inhabit and by you that made me that with the companion you bestow i will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell as it may chance in the most savage of places my evil passions will have fled for i shall meet with sympathy my life will flow quietly away and in my dying moments i shall not curse my maker his words had a strange effect upon me i compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him but when i looked upon him when i saw the filthy mass that moved and talked my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred i tried to stifle these sensations i thought that as i could not sympathise with him i had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow you swear i said to be harmless but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you may not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge how is this i must not be trifled with and i demand an answer if i have no ties and no affections hatred and vice must be my portion the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes and i shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant my vices are the children of a forced solitude that i abhor and my virtues will necessarily arise when i live in communion with an equal i shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which i am now excluded i paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed i thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him his power and threats were not omitted in my calculations a creature who could exist in the icecaves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with after a long pause of reflection i concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that i should comply with his request turning to him therefore i said i consent to your demand on your solemn oath to quit europe for ever and every other place in the neighbourhood of man as soon as i shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile i swear he cried by the sun and by the blue sky of heaven and by the fire of love that burns my heart that if you grant my prayer while they exist you shall never behold me again depart to your home and commence your labours i shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety and fear not but that when you are ready i shall appear saying this he suddenly quitted me fearful perhaps of any change in my sentiments i saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice his tale had occupied the whole day and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed i knew that i ought to hasten my descent towards the valley as i should soon be encompassed in darkness but my heart was heavy and my steps slow the labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as i advanced perplexed me occupied as i was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced night was far advanced when i came to the halfway restingplace and seated myself beside the fountain the stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them the dark pines rose before me and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me i wept bitterly and clasping my hands in agony i exclaimed oh stars and clouds and winds ye are all about to mock me if ye really pity me crush sensation and memory let me become as nought but if not depart depart and leave me in darkness these were wild and miserable thoughts but i cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how i listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me morning dawned before i arrived at the village of chamounix i took no rest but returned immediately to geneva even in my own heart i could give no expression to my sensationsthey weighed on me with a mountains weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them thus i returned home and entering the house presented myself to the family my haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm but i answered no question scarcely did i speak i felt as if i were placed under a banas if i had no right to claim their sympathiesas if never more might i enjoy companionship with them yet even thus i loved them to adoration and to save them i resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task the prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream and that thought only had to me the reality of life chapter day after day week after week passed away on my return to geneva and i could not collect the courage to recommence my work i feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend yet i was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me i found that i could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition i had heard of some discoveries having been made by an english philosopher the knowledge of which was material to my success and i sometimes thought of obtaining my fathers consent to visit england for this purpose but i clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me a change indeed had taken place in me my health which had hitherto declined was now much restored and my spirits when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise rose proportionably my father saw this change with pleasure and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy which every now and then would return by fits and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine at these moments i took refuge in the most perfect solitude i passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves silent and listless but the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure and on my return i met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart it was after my return from one of these rambles that my father calling me aside thus addressed me i am happy to remark my dear son that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself and yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society for some time i was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this but yesterday an idea struck me and if it is well founded i conjure you to avow it reserve on such a point would be not only useless but draw down treble misery on us all i trembled violently at his exordium and my father continued i confess my son that i have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years you were attached to each other from your earliest infancy you studied together and appeared in dispositions and tastes entirely suited to one another but so blind is the experience of man that what i conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it you perhaps regard her as your sister without any wish that she might become your wife nay you may have met with another whom you may love and considering yourself as bound in honour to elizabeth this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel my dear father reassure yourself i love my cousin tenderly and sincerely i never saw any woman who excited as elizabeth does my warmest admiration and affection my future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union the expression of your sentiments of this subject my dear victor gives me more pleasure than i have for some time experienced if you feel thus we shall assuredly be happy however present events may cast a gloom over us but it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that i wish to dissipate tell me therefore whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage we have been unfortunate and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities you are younger yet i do not suppose possessed as you are of a competent fortune that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed do not suppose however that i wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness interpret my words with candour and answer me i conjure you with confidence and sincerity i listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply i revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion alas to me the idea of an immediate union with my elizabeth was one of horror and dismay i was bound by a solemn promise which i had not yet fulfilled and dared not break or if i did what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family could i enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground i must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before i allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which i expected peace i remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to england or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking the latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory besides i had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my fathers house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those i loved i knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror i was aware also that i should often lose all selfcommand all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation i must absent myself from all i loved while thus employed once commenced it would quickly be achieved and i might be restored to my family in peace and happiness my promise fulfilled the monster would depart for ever or so my fond fancy imaged some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever these feelings dictated my answer to my father i expressed a wish to visit england but concealing the true reasons of this request i clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion while i urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply after so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects he was glad to find that i was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would before my return have restored me entirely to myself the duration of my absence was left to my own choice a few months or at most a year was the period contemplated one paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion without previously communicating with me he had in concert with elizabeth arranged that clerval should join me at strasburgh this interfered with the solitude i coveted for the prosecution of my task yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment and truly i rejoiced that thus i should be saved many hours of lonely maddening reflection nay henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe if i were alone would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress to england therefore i was bound and it was understood that my union with elizabeth should take place immediately on my return my fathers age rendered him extremely averse to delay for myself there was one reward i promised myself from my detested toilsone consolation for my unparalleled sufferings it was the prospect of that day when enfranchised from my miserable slavery i might claim elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her i now made arrangements for my journey but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation during my absence i should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks exasperated as he might be by my departure but he had promised to follow me wherever i might go and would he not accompany me to england this imagination was dreadful in itself but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends i was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen but through the whole period during which i was the slave of my creature i allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations it was in the latter end of september that i again quitted my native country my journey had been my own suggestion and elizabeth therefore acquiesced but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering away from her the inroads of misery and grief it had been her care which provided me a companion in clervaland yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a womans sedulous attention she longed to bid me hasten my return a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful silent farewell i threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away hardly knowing whither i was going and careless of what was passing around i remembered only and it was with a bitter anguish that i reflected on it to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me filled with dreary imaginations i passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes but my eyes were fixed and unobserving i could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured after some days spent in listless indolence during which i traversed many leagues i arrived at strasburgh where i waited two days for clerval he came alas how great was the contrast between us he was alive to every new scene joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day he pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky this is what it is to live he cried now i enjoy existence but you my dear frankenstein wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful in truth i was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the rhine and you my friend would be far more amused with the journal of clerval who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight than in listening to my reflections i a miserable wretch haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment we had agreed to descend the rhine in a boat from strasburgh to rotterdam whence we might take shipping for london during this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns we stayed a day at mannheim and on the fifth from our departure from strasburgh arrived at mainz the course of the rhine below mainz becomes much more picturesque the river descends rapidly and winds between hills not high but steep and of beautiful forms we saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices surrounded by black woods high and inaccessible this part of the rhine indeed presents a singularly variegated landscape in one spot you view rugged hills ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices with the dark rhine rushing beneath and on the sudden turn of a promontory flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene we travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream even i depressed in mind and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings even i was pleased i lay at the bottom of the boat and as i gazed on the cloudless blue sky i seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which i had long been a stranger and if these were my sensations who can describe those of henry he felt as if he had been transported to fairyland and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man i have seen he said the most beautiful scenes of my own country i have visited the lakes of lucerne and uri where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water casting black and impenetrable shades which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance i have seen this lake agitated by a tempest when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the waterspout must be on the great ocean and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind i have seen the mountains of la valais and the pays de vaud but this country victor pleases me more than all those wonders the mountains of switzerland are more majestic and strange but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that i never before saw equalled look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice and that also on the island almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain oh surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country clerval beloved friend even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving he was a being formed in the very poetry of nature his wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart his soul overflowed with ardent affections and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldlyminded teach us to look for only in the imagination but even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind the scenery of external nature which others regard only with admiration he loved with ardour the sounding cataract haunted him like a passion the tall rock the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood their colours and their forms were then to him an appetite a feeling and a love that had no need of a remoter charm by thought supplied or any interest unborrowd from the eye wordsworths tintern abbey and where does he now exist is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever has this mind so replete with ideas imaginations fanciful and magnificent which formed a world whose existence depended on the life of its creatorhas this mind perished does it now only exist in my memory no it is not thus your form so divinely wrought and beaming with beauty has decayed but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend pardon this gush of sorrow these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of henry but they soothe my heart overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates i will proceed with my tale beyond cologne we descended to the plains of holland and we resolved to post the remainder of our way for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery but we arrived in a few days at rotterdam whence we proceeded by sea to england it was on a clear morning in the latter days of december that i first saw the white cliffs of britain the banks of the thames presented a new scene they were flat but fertile and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story we saw tilbury fort and remembered the spanish armada gravesend woolwich and greenwichplaces which i had heard of even in my country at length we saw the numerous steeples of london st pauls towering above all and the tower famed in english history chapter london was our present point of rest we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time but this was with me a secondary object i was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that i had brought with me addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers if this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure but a blight had come over my existence and i only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound company was irksome to me when alone i could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth the voice of henry soothed me and i could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace but busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart i saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men this barrier was sealed with the blood of william and justine and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish but in clerval i saw the image of my former self he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction the difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement he was also pursuing an object he had long had in view his design was to visit india in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages and in the views he had taken of its society the means of materially assisting the progress of european colonization and trade in britain only could he further the execution of his plan he was for ever busy and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind i tried to conceal this as much as possible that i might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection i often refused to accompany him alleging another engagement that i might remain alone i now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish and every word that i spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver and my heart to palpitate after passing some months in london we received a letter from a person in scotland who had formerly been our visitor at geneva he mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as perth where he resided clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation and i although i abhorred society wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which nature adorns her chosen dwellingplaces we had arrived in england at the beginning of october and it was now february we accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month in this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to edinburgh but to visit windsor oxford matlock and the cumberland lakes resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of july i packed up my chemical instruments and the materials i had collected resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of scotland we quitted london on the th of march and remained a few days at windsor rambling in its beautiful forest this was a new scene to us mountaineers the majestic oaks the quantity of game and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us from thence we proceeded to oxford as we entered this city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before it was here that charles i had collected his forces this city had remained faithful to him after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty the memory of that unfortunate king and his companions the amiable falkland the insolent goring his queen and son gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited the spirit of elder days found a dwelling here and we delighted to trace its footsteps if these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration the colleges are ancient and picturesque the streets are almost magnificent and the lovely isis which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers and spires and domes embosomed among aged trees i enjoyed this scene and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future i was formed for peaceful happiness during my youthful days discontent never visited my mind and if i was ever overcome by _ennui_ the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits but i am a blasted tree the bolt has entered my soul and i felt then that i should survive to exhibit what i shall soon cease to bea miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity pitiable to others and intolerable to myself we passed a considerable period at oxford rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of english history our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves we visited the tomb of the illustrious hampden and the field on which that patriot fell for a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and selfsacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers for an instant i dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit but the iron had eaten into my flesh and i sank again trembling and hopeless into my miserable self we left oxford with regret and proceeded to matlock which was our next place of rest the country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled to a greater degree the scenery of switzerland but everything is on a lower scale and the green hills want the crown of distant white alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country we visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at servox and chamounix the latter name made me tremble when pronounced by henry and i hastened to quit matlock with which that terrible scene was thus associated from derby still journeying northwards we passed two months in cumberland and westmorland i could now almost fancy myself among the swiss mountains the little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains the lakes and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me here also we made some acquaintances who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness the delight of clerval was proportionably greater than mine his mind expanded in the company of men of talent and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors i could pass my life here said he to me and among these mountains i should scarcely regret switzerland and the rhine but he found that a travellers life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments his feelings are for ever on the stretch and when he begins to sink into repose he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new which again engages his attention and which also he forsakes for other novelties we had scarcely visited the various lakes of cumberland and westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our scotch friend approached and we left them to travel on for my own part i was not sorry i had now neglected my promise for some time and i feared the effects of the dæmons disappointment he might remain in switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives this idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which i might otherwise have snatched repose and peace i waited for my letters with feverish impatience if they were delayed i was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears and when they arrived and i saw the superscription of elizabeth or my father i hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate sometimes i thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion when these thoughts possessed me i would not quit henry for a moment but followed him as his shadow to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer i felt as if i had committed some great crime the consciousness of which haunted me i was guiltless but i had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head as mortal as that of crime i visited edinburgh with languid eyes and mind and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being clerval did not like it so well as oxford for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him but the beauty and regularity of the new town of edinburgh its romantic castle and its environs the most delightful in the world arthurs seat st bernards well and the pentland hills compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration but i was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey we left edinburgh in a week passing through coupar st andrews and along the banks of the tay to perth where our friend expected us but i was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest and accordingly i told clerval that i wished to make the tour of scotland alone do you said i enjoy yourself and let this be our rendezvous i may be absent a month or two but do not interfere with my motions i entreat you leave me to peace and solitude for a short time and when i return i hope it will be with a lighter heart more congenial to your own temper henry wished to dissuade me but seeing me bent on this plan ceased to remonstrate he entreated me to write often i had rather be with you he said in your solitary rambles than with these scotch people whom i do not know hasten then my dear friend to return that i may again feel myself somewhat at home which i cannot do in your absence having parted from my friend i determined to visit some remote spot of scotland and finish my work in solitude i did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when i should have finished that he might receive his companion with this resolution i traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the orkneys as the scene of my labours it was a place fitted for such a work being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves the soil was barren scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows and oatmeal for its inhabitants which consisted of five persons whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare vegetables and bread when they indulged in such luxuries and even fresh water was to be procured from the mainland which was about five miles distant on the whole island there were but three miserable huts and one of these was vacant when i arrived this i hired it contained but two rooms and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury the thatch had fallen in the walls were unplastered and the door was off its hinges i ordered it to be repaired bought some furniture and took possession an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty as it was i lived ungazed at and unmolested hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which i gave so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men in this retreat i devoted the morning to labour but in the evening when the weather permitted i walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet it was a monotonous yet everchanging scene i thought of switzerland it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape its hills are covered with vines and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky and when troubled by the winds their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean in this manner i distributed my occupations when i first arrived but as i proceeded in my labour it became every day more horrible and irksome to me sometimes i could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days and at other times i toiled day and night in order to complete my work it was indeed a filthy process in which i was engaged during my first experiment a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings but now i went to it in cold blood and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands thus situated employed in the most detestable occupation immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which i was engaged my spirits became unequal i grew restless and nervous every moment i feared to meet my persecutor sometimes i sat with my eyes fixed on the ground fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which i so much dreaded to behold i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion in the mean time i worked on and my labour was already considerably advanced i looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope which i dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom chapter i sat one evening in my laboratory the sun had set and the moon was just rising from the sea i had not sufficient light for my employment and i remained idle in a pause of consideration of whether i should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it as i sat a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what i was now doing three years before i was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse i was now about to form another being of whose dispositions i was alike ignorant she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight for its own sake in murder and wretchedness he had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts but she had not and she who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation they might even hate each other the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form she also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man she might quit him and he be again alone exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species even if they were to leave europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would be children and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror had i right for my own benefit to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations i had before been moved by the sophisms of the being i had created i had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats but now for the first time the wickedness of my promise burst upon me i shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price perhaps of the existence of the whole human race i trembled and my heart failed within me when on looking up i saw by the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement a ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me where i sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me yes he had followed me in my travels he had loitered in forests hid himself in caves or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise as i looked on him his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery i thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him and trembling with passion tore to pieces the thing on which i was engaged the wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge withdrew i left the room and locking the door made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours and then with trembling steps i sought my own apartment i was alone none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries several hours passed and i remained near my window gazing on the sea it was almost motionless for the winds were hushed and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon a few fishing vessels alone specked the water and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another i felt the silence although i was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore and a person landed close to my house in a few minutes after i heard the creaking of my door as if some one endeavoured to open it softly i trembled from head to foot i felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine but i was overcome by the sensation of helplessness so often felt in frightful dreams when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger and was rooted to the spot presently i heard the sound of footsteps along the passage the door opened and the wretch whom i dreaded appeared shutting the door he approached me and said in a smothered voice you have destroyed the work which you began what is it that you intend do you dare to break your promise i have endured toil and misery i left switzerland with you i crept along the shores of the rhine among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills i have dwelt many months in the heaths of england and among the deserts of scotland i have endured incalculable fatigue and cold and hunger do you dare destroy my hopes begone i do break my promise never will i create another like yourself equal in deformity and wickedness slave i before reasoned with you but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension remember that i have power you believe yourself miserable but i can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you you are my creator but i am your master obey the hour of my irresolution is past and the period of your power is arrived your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice shall i in cool blood set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose delight is in death and wretchedness begone i am firm and your words will only exasperate my rage the monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger shall each man cried he find a wife for his bosom and each beast have his mate and i be alone i had feelings of affection and they were requited by detestation and scorn man you may hate but beware your hours will pass in dread and misery and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever are you to be happy while i grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness you can blast my other passions but revenge remainsrevenge henceforth dearer than light or food i may die but first you my tyrant and tormentor shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery beware for i am fearless and therefore powerful i will watch with the wiliness of a snake that i may sting with its venom man you shall repent of the injuries you inflict devil cease and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice i have declared my resolution to you and i am no coward to bend beneath words leave me i am inexorable it is well i go but remember i shall be with you on your weddingnight i started forward and exclaimed villain before you sign my deathwarrant be sure that you are yourself safe i would have seized him but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation in a few moments i saw him in his boat which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves all was again silent but his words rang in my ears i burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean i walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me why had i not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife but i had suffered him to depart and he had directed his course towards the mainland i shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge and then i thought again of his words_i will be with you on your weddingnight_ that then was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny in that hour i should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice the prospect did not move me to fear yet when i thought of my beloved elizabeth of her tears and endless sorrow when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her tears the first i had shed for many months streamed from my eyes and i resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle the night passed away and the sun rose from the ocean my feelings became calmer if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair i left the house the horrid scene of the last nights contention and walked on the beach of the sea which i almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures nay a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me i desired that i might pass my life on that barren rock wearily it is true but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery if i returned it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom i most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon whom i had myself created i walked about the isle like a restless spectre separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation when it became noon and the sun rose higher i lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep i had been awake the whole of the preceding night my nerves were agitated and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery the sleep into which i now sank refreshed me and when i awoke i again felt as if i belonged to a race of human beings like myself and i began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a deathknell they appeared like a dream yet distinct and oppressive as a reality the sun had far descended and i still sat on the shore satisfying my appetite which had become ravenous with an oaten cake when i saw a fishingboat land close to me and one of the men brought me a packet it contained letters from geneva and one from clerval entreating me to join him he said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was that letters from the friends he had formed in london desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his indian enterprise he could not any longer delay his departure but as his journey to london might be followed even sooner than he now conjectured by his longer voyage he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as i could spare he besought me therefore to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at perth that we might proceed southwards together this letter in a degree recalled me to life and i determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days yet before i departed there was a task to perform on which i shuddered to reflect i must pack up my chemical instruments and for that purpose i must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work and i must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me the next morning at daybreak i summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory the remains of the halffinished creature whom i had destroyed lay scattered on the floor and i almost felt as if i had mangled the living flesh of a human being i paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber with trembling hand i conveyed the instruments out of the room but i reflected that i ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants and i accordingly put them into a basket with a great quantity of stones and laying them up determined to throw them into the sea that very night and in the meantime i sat upon the beach employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon i had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that with whatever consequences must be fulfilled but i now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that i for the first time saw clearly the idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me the threat i had heard weighed on my thoughts but i did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it i had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend i had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness and i banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion between two and three in the morning the moon rose and i then putting my basket aboard a little skiff sailed out about four miles from the shore the scene was perfectly solitary a few boats were returning towards land but i sailed away from them i felt as if i was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures at one time the moon which had before been clear was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud and i took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea i listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot the sky became clouded but the air was pure although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising but it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water and fixing the rudder in a direct position stretched myself at the bottom of the boat clouds hid the moon everything was obscure and i heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves the murmur lulled me and in a short time i slept soundly i do not know how long i remained in this situation but when i awoke i found that the sun had already mounted considerably the wind was high and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff i found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which i had embarked i endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if i again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water thus situated my only resource was to drive before the wind i confess that i felt a few sensations of terror i had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me i might be driven into the wide atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me i had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst a prelude to my other sufferings i looked on the heavens which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind only to be replaced by others i looked upon the sea it was to be my grave fiend i exclaimed your task is already fulfilled i thought of elizabeth of my father and of clervalall left behind on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions this idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever i shudder to reflect on it some hours passed thus but by degrees as the sun declined towards the horizon the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers but these gave place to a heavy swell i felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder when suddenly i saw a line of high land towards the south almost spent as i was by fatigue and the dreadful suspense i endured for several hours this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart and tears gushed from my eyes how mutable are our feelings and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery i constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land it had a wild and rocky appearance but as i approached nearer i easily perceived the traces of cultivation i saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man i carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which i at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory as i was in a state of extreme debility i resolved to sail directly towards the town as a place where i could most easily procure nourishment fortunately i had money with me as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good harbour which i entered my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape as i was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails several people crowded towards the spot they seemed much surprised at my appearance but instead of offering me any assistance whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm as it was i merely remarked that they spoke english and i therefore addressed them in that language my good friends said i will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where i am you will know that soon enough replied a man with a hoarse voice maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste but you will not be consulted as to your quarters i promise you i was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger and i was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions why do you answer me so roughly i replied surely it is not the custom of englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably i do not know said the man what the custom of the english may be but it is the custom of the irish to hate villains while this strange dialogue continued i perceived the crowd rapidly increase their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me i inquired the way to the inn but no one replied i then moved forward and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me when an illlooking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said come sir you must follow me to mr kirwins to give an account of yourself who is mr kirwin why am i to give an account of myself is not this a free country ay sir free enough for honest folks mr kirwin is a magistrate and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night this answer startled me but i presently recovered myself i was innocent that could easily be proved accordingly i followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town i was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger but being surrounded by a crowd i thought it politic to rouse all my strength that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt little did i then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death i must pause here for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which i am about to relate in proper detail to my recollection chapter i was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners he looked upon me however with some degree of severity and then turning towards my conductors he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion about half a dozen men came forward and one being selected by the magistrate he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brotherinlaw daniel nugent when about ten oclock they observed a strong northerly blast rising and they accordingly put in for port it was a very dark night as the moon had not yet risen they did not land at the harbour but as they had been accustomed at a creek about two miles below he walked on first carrying a part of the fishing tackle and his companions followed him at some distance as he was proceeding along the sands he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground his companions came up to assist him and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man who was to all appearance dead their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold they instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured but in vain to restore it to life it appeared to be a handsome young man about five and twenty years of age he had apparently been strangled for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated my limbs trembled and a mist came over my eyes which obliged me to lean on a chair for support the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner the son confirmed his fathers account but when daniel nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion he saw a boat with a single man in it at a short distance from the shore and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars it was the same boat in which i had just landed a woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage waiting for the return of the fishermen about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house it was not cold they put it into a bed and rubbed it and daniel went to the town for an apothecary but life was quite gone several other men were examined concerning my landing and they agreed that with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night it was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed besides they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body from another place and it was likely that as i did not appear to know the shore i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of from the place where i had deposited the corpse mr kirwin on hearing this evidence desired that i should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me this idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation i had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described i was accordingly conducted by the magistrate and several other persons to the inn i could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night but knowing that i had been conversing with several persons in the island i had inhabited about the time that the body had been found i was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair i entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin how can i describe my sensations on beholding it i feel yet parched with horror nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony the examination the presence of the magistrate and witnesses passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry clerval stretched before me i gasped for breath and throwing myself on the body i exclaimed have my murderous machinations deprived you also my dearest henry of life two i have already destroyed other victims await their destiny but you clerval my friend my benefactor the human frame could no longer support the agonies that i endured and i was carried out of the room in strong convulsions a fever succeeded to this i lay for two months on the point of death my ravings as i afterwards heard were frightful i called myself the murderer of william of justine and of clerval sometimes i entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom i was tormented and at others i felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck and screamed aloud with agony and terror fortunately as i spoke my native language mr kirwin alone understood me but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses why did i not die more miserable than man ever was before why did i not sink into forgetfulness and rest death snatches away many blooming children the only hopes of their doting parents how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb of what materials was i made that i could thus resist so many shocks which like the turning of the wheel continually renewed the torture but i was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream in a prison stretched on a wretched bed surrounded by gaolers turnkeys bolts and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon it was morning i remember when i thus awoke to understanding i had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me but when i looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which i was all flashed across my memory and i groaned bitterly this sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me she was a hired nurse the wife of one of the turnkeys and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class the lines of her face were hard and rude like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery her tone expressed her entire indifference she addressed me in english and the voice struck me as one that i had heard during my sufferings are you better now sir said she i replied in the same language with a feeble voice i believe i am but if it be all true if indeed i did not dream i am sorry that i am still alive to feel this misery and horror for that matter replied the old woman if you mean about the gentleman you murdered i believe that it were better for you if you were dead for i fancy it will go hard with you however thats none of my business i am sent to nurse you and get you well i do my duty with a safe conscience it were well if everybody did the same i turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved on the very edge of death but i felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed the whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream i sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality as the images that floated before me became more distinct i grew feverish a darkness pressed around me no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love no dear hand supported me the physician came and prescribed medicines and the old woman prepared them for me but utter carelessness was visible in the first and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee these were my first reflections but i soon learned that mr kirwin had shown me extreme kindness he had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me wretched indeed was the best and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse it is true he seldom came to see me for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer he came therefore sometimes to see that i was not neglected but his visits were short and with long intervals one day while i was gradually recovering i was seated in a chair my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death i was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected i had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness at one time i considered whether i should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law less innocent than poor justine had been such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and mr kirwin entered his countenance expressed sympathy and compassion he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in french i fear that this place is very shocking to you can i do anything to make you more comfortable i thank you but all that you mention is nothing to me on the whole earth there is no comfort which i am capable of receiving i know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune but you will i hope soon quit this melancholy abode for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge that is my least concern i am by a course of strange events become the most miserable of mortals persecuted and tortured as i am and have been can death be any evil to me nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred you were thrown by some surprising accident on this shore renowned for its hospitality seized immediately and charged with murder the first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed as it were by some fiend across your path as mr kirwin said this notwithstanding the agitation i endured on this retrospect of my sufferings i also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me i suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance for mr kirwin hastened to say immediately upon your being taken ill all the papers that were on your person were brought me and i examined them that i might discover some trace by which i could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness i found several letters and among others one which i discovered from its commencement to be from your father i instantly wrote to geneva nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter but you are ill even now you tremble you are unfit for agitation of any kind this suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event tell me what new scene of death has been acted and whose murder i am now to lament your family is perfectly well said mr kirwin with gentleness and someone a friend is come to visit you i know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of clerval as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires i put my hand before my eyes and cried out in agony oh take him away i cannot see him for gods sake do not let him enter mr kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance he could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone i should have thought young man that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance my father cried i while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure is my father indeed come how kind how very kind but where is he why does he not hasten to me my change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence he rose and quitted the room with my nurse and in a moment my father entered it nothing at this moment could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father i stretched out my hand to him and cried are you then safeand elizabethand ernest my father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart to raise my desponding spirits but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness what a place is this that you inhabit my son said he looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room you travelled to seek happiness but a fatality seems to pursue you and poor clerval the name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state i shed tears alas yes my father replied i some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me and i must live to fulfil it or surely i should have died on the coffin of henry we were not allowed to converse for any length of time for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity mr kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion but the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel and i gradually recovered my health as my sickness quitted me i was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate the image of clerval was for ever before me ghastly and murdered more than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse alas why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life it was surely that i might fulfil my destiny which is now drawing to a close soon oh very soon will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust and in executing the award of justice i shall also sink to rest then the appearance of death was distant although the wish was ever present to my thoughts and i often sat for hours motionless and speechless wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins the season of the assizes approached i had already been three months in prison and although i was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse i was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held mr kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence i was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death the grand jury rejected the bill on its being proved that i was on the orkney islands at the hour the body of my friend was found and a fortnight after my removal i was liberated from prison my father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge that i was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country i did not participate in these feelings for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful the cup of life was poisoned for ever and although the sun shone upon me as upon the happy and gay of heart i saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me sometimes they were the expressive eyes of henry languishing in death the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them sometimes it was the watery clouded eyes of the monster as i first saw them in my chamber at ingolstadt my father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection he talked of geneva which i should soon visit of elizabeth and ernest but these words only drew deep groans from me sometimes indeed i felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed with a devouring _maladie du pays_ to see once more the blue lake and rapid rhone that had been so dear to me in early childhood but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair at these moments i often endeavoured to put an end to the existence i loathed and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence yet one duty remained to me the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair it was necessary that i should return without delay to geneva there to watch over the lives of those i so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment or if he dared again to blast me by his presence i might with unfailing aim put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which i had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous my father still desired to delay our departure fearful that i could not sustain the fatigues of a journey for i was a shattered wreckthe shadow of a human being my strength was gone i was a mere skeleton and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame still as i urged our leaving ireland with such inquietude and impatience my father thought it best to yield we took our passage on board a vessel bound for havredegrace and sailed with a fair wind from the irish shores it was midnight i lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves i hailed the darkness that shut ireland from my sight and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when i reflected that i should soon see geneva the past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream yet the vessel in which i was the wind that blew me from the detested shore of ireland and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that i was deceived by no vision and that clerval my friend and dearest companion had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation i repassed in my memory my whole life my quiet happiness while residing with my family in geneva the death of my mother and my departure for ingolstadt i remembered shuddering the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy and i called to mind the night in which he first lived i was unable to pursue the train of thought a thousand feelings pressed upon me and i wept bitterly ever since my recovery from the fever i had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum for it was by means of this drug only that i was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes i now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly but sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me towards morning i was possessed by a kind of nightmare i felt the fiends grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it groans and cries rang in my ears my father who was watching over me perceiving my restlessness awoke me the dashing waves were around the cloudy sky above the fiend was not here a sense of security a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible chapter the voyage came to an end we landed and proceeded to paris i soon found that i had overtaxed my strength and that i must repose before i could continue my journey my fathers care and attentions were indefatigable but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill he wished me to seek amusement in society i abhorred the face of man oh not abhorred they were my brethren my fellow beings and i felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism but i felt that i had no right to share their intercourse i had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans how they would each and all abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me my father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair sometimes he thought that i felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride alas my father said i how little do you know me human beings their feelings and passions would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as i felt pride justine poor unhappy justine was as innocent as i and she suffered the same charge she died for it and i am the cause of thisi murdered her william justine and henrythey all died by my hands my father had often during my imprisonment heard me make the same assertion when i thus accused myself he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium and that during my illness some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination the remembrance of which i preserved in my convalescence i avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch i had created i had a persuasion that i should be supposed mad and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue but besides i could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast i checked therefore my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when i would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret yet still words like those i have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me i could offer no explanation of them but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe upon this occasion my father said with an expression of unbounded wonder my dearest victor what infatuation is this my dear son i entreat you never to make such an assertion again i am not mad i cried energetically the sun and the heavens who have viewed my operations can bear witness of my truth i am the assassin of those most innocent victims they died by my machinations a thousand times would i have shed my own blood drop by drop to have saved their lives but i could not my father indeed i could not sacrifice the whole human race the conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts he wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes as time passed away i became more calm misery had her dwelling in my heart but i no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes sufficient for me was the consciousness of them by the utmost selfviolence i curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice a few days before we left paris on our way to switzerland i received the following letter from elizabeth my dear friend it gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at paris you are no longer at a formidable distance and i may hope to see you in less than a fortnight my poor cousin how much you must have suffered i expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted geneva this winter has been passed most miserably tortured as i have been by anxious suspense yet i hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity yet i fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago even perhaps augmented by time i would not disturb you at this period when so many misfortunes weigh upon you but a conversation that i had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet explanation you may possibly say what can elizabeth have to explain if you really say this my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied but you are distant from me and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation and in a probability of this being the case i dare not any longer postpone writing what during your absence i have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin you well know victor that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy we were told this when young and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place we were affectionate playfellows during childhood and i believe dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older but as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union may not such also be our case tell me dearest victor answer me i conjure you by our mutual happiness with simple truthdo you not love another you have travelled you have spent several years of your life at ingolstadt and i confess to you my friend that when i saw you last autumn so unhappy flying to solitude from the society of every creature i could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents although they opposed themselves to your inclinations but this is false reasoning i confess to you my friend that i love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion but it is your happiness i desire as well as my own when i declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice even now i weep to think that borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes you may stifle by the word _honour_ all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself i who have so disinterested an affection for you may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes ah victor be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition be happy my friend and if you obey me in this one request remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity do not let this letter disturb you do not answer tomorrow or the next day or even until you come if it will give you pain my uncle will send me news of your health and if i see but one smile on your lips when we meet occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine i shall need no other happiness elizabeth lavenza geneva may th this letter revived in my memory what i had before forgotten the threat of the fiend_i will be with you on your weddingnight_ such was my sentence and on that night would the dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings on that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death well be it so a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place in which if he were victorious i should be at peace and his power over me be at an end if he were vanquished i should be a free man alas what freedom such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes his cottage burnt his lands laid waste and he is turned adrift homeless penniless and alone but free such would be my liberty except that in my elizabeth i possessed a treasure alas balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death sweet and beloved elizabeth i read and reread her letter and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy but the apple was already eaten and the angels arm bared to drive me from all hope yet i would die to make her happy if the monster executed his threat death was inevitable yet again i considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate my destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner but if my torturer should suspect that i postponed it influenced by his menaces he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge he had vowed _to be with me on my weddingnight_ yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood he had murdered clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats i resolved therefore that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my fathers happiness my adversarys designs against my life should not retard it a single hour in this state of mind i wrote to elizabeth my letter was calm and affectionate i fear my beloved girl i said little happiness remains for us on earth yet all that i may one day enjoy is centred in you chase away your idle fears to you alone do i consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment i have one secret elizabeth a dreadful one when revealed to you it will chill your frame with horror and then far from being surprised at my misery you will only wonder that i survive what i have endured i will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place for my sweet cousin there must be perfect confidence between us but until then i conjure you do not mention or allude to it this i most earnestly entreat and i know you will comply in about a week after the arrival of elizabeths letter we returned to geneva the sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks i saw a change in her also she was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as i was the tranquillity which i now enjoyed did not endure memory brought madness with it and when i thought of what had passed a real insanity possessed me sometimes i was furious and burnt with rage sometimes low and despondent i neither spoke nor looked at anyone but sat motionless bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor she wept with me and for me when reason returned she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation ah it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned but for the guilty there is no peace the agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with elizabeth i remained silent have you then some other attachment none on earth i love elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight let the day therefore be fixed and on it i will consecrate myself in life or death to the happiness of my cousin my dear victor do not speak thus heavy misfortunes have befallen us but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune and when time shall have softened your despair new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived such were the lessons of my father but to me the remembrance of the threat returned nor can you wonder that omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood i should almost regard him as invincible and that when he had pronounced the words _i shall be with you on your weddingnight_ i should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable but death was no evil to me if the loss of elizabeth were balanced with it and i therefore with a contented and even cheerful countenance agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent the ceremony should take place in ten days and thus put as i imagined the seal to my fate great god if for one instant i had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary i would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage but as if possessed of magic powers the monster had blinded me to his real intentions and when i thought that i had prepared only my own death i hastened that of a far dearer victim as the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling i felt my heart sink within me but i concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father but hardly deceived the everwatchful and nicer eye of elizabeth she looked forward to our union with placid contentment not unmingled with a little fear which past misfortunes had impressed that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret preparations were made for the event congratulatory visits were received and all wore a smiling appearance i shut up as well as i could in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy through my fathers exertions a part of the inheritance of elizabeth had been restored to her by the austrian government a small possession on the shores of como belonged to her it was agreed that immediately after our union we should proceed to villa lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood in the meantime i took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me i carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity indeed as the period approached the threat appeared more as a delusion not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace while the happiness i hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and i heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent elizabeth seemed happy my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind but on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny she was melancholy and a presentiment of evil pervaded her and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which i had promised to reveal to her on the following day my father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride after the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my fathers but it was agreed that elizabeth and i should commence our journey by water sleeping that night at evian and continuing our voyage on the following day the day was fair the wind favourable all smiled on our nuptial embarkation those were the last moments of my life during which i enjoyed the feeling of happiness we passed rapidly along the sun was hot but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene sometimes on one side of the lake where we saw mont salêve the pleasant banks of montalègre and at a distance surmounting all the beautiful mont blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her sometimes coasting the opposite banks we saw the mighty jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it i took the hand of elizabeth you are sorrowful my love ah if you knew what i have suffered and what i may yet endure you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy be happy my dear victor replied elizabeth there is i hope nothing to distress you and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face my heart is contented something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us but i will not listen to such a sinister voice observe how fast we move along and how the clouds which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of mont blanc render this scene of beauty still more interesting look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom what a divine day how happy and serene all nature appears thus elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects but her temper was fluctuating joy for a few instants shone in her eyes but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie the sun sank lower in the heavens we passed the river drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills the alps here come closer to the lake and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary the spire of evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung the wind which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity sank at sunset to a light breeze the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay the sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed and as i touched the shore i felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever chapter it was eight oclock when we landed we walked for a short time on the shore enjoying the transitory light and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters woods and mountains obscured in darkness yet still displaying their black outlines the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended i had been calm during the day but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects a thousand fears arose in my mind i was anxious and watchful while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom every sound terrified me but i resolved that i would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her and trembling she asked what is it that agitates you my dear victor what is it you fear oh peace peace my love replied i this night and all will be safe but this night is dreadful very dreadful i passed an hour in this state of mind when suddenly i reflected how fearful the combat which i momentarily expected would be to my wife and i earnestly entreated her to retire resolving not to join her until i had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy she left me and i continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary but i discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired as i heard it the whole truth rushed into my mind my arms dropped the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs this state lasted but for an instant the scream was repeated and i rushed into the room great god why did i not then expire why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth she was there lifeless and inanimate thrown across the bed her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair everywhere i turn i see the same figureher bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier could i behold this and live alas life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated for a moment only did i lose recollection i fell senseless on the ground when i recovered i found myself surrounded by the people of the inn their countenances expressed a breathless terror but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me i escaped from them to the room where lay the body of elizabeth my love my wife so lately living so dear so worthy she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her and now as she lay her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck i might have supposed her asleep i rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished the murderous mark of the fiends grasp was on her neck and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips while i still hung over her in the agony of despair i happened to look up the windows of the room had before been darkened and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not to be described i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred a grin was on the face of the monster he seemed to jeer as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife i rushed towards the window and drawing a pistol from my bosom fired but he eluded me leaped from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room i pointed to the spot where he had disappeared and we followed the track with boats nets were cast but in vain after passing several hours we returned hopeless most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy after having landed they proceeded to search the country parties going in different directions among the woods and vines i attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house but my head whirled round my steps were like those of a drunken man i fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion a film covered my eyes and my skin was parched with the heat of fever in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed hardly conscious of what had happened my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that i had lost after an interval i arose and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay there were women weeping around i hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind but my thoughts rambled to various subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause i was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror the death of william the execution of justine the murder of clerval and lastly of my wife even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend my father even now might be writhing under his grasp and ernest might be dead at his feet this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action i started up and resolved to return to geneva with all possible speed there were no horses to be procured and i must return by the lake but the wind was unfavourable and the rain fell in torrents however it was hardly morning and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night i hired men to row and took an oar myself for i had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise but the overflowing misery i now felt and the excess of agitation that i endured rendered me incapable of any exertion i threw down the oar and leaning my head upon my hands gave way to every gloomy idea that arose if i looked up i saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which i had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection tears streamed from my eyes the rain had ceased for a moment and i saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before they had then been observed by elizabeth nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change the sun might shine or the clouds might lower but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before a fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness no creature had ever been so miserable as i was so frightful an event is single in the history of man but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event mine has been a tale of horrors i have reached their _acme_ and what i must now relate can but be tedious to you know that one by one my friends were snatched away i was left desolate my own strength is exhausted and i must tell in a few words what remains of my hideous narration i arrived at geneva my father and ernest yet lived but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore i see him now excellent and venerable old man his eyes wandered in vacancy for they had lost their charm and their delighthis elizabeth his more than daughter whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels who in the decline of life having few affections clings more earnestly to those that remain cursed cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him the springs of existence suddenly gave way he was unable to rise from his bed and in a few days he died in my arms what then became of me i know not i lost sensation and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me sometimes indeed i dreamt that i wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth but i awoke and found myself in a dungeon melancholy followed but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison for they had called me mad and during many months as i understood a solitary cell had been my habitation liberty however had been a useless gift to me had i not as i awakened to reason at the same time awakened to revenge as the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me i began to reflect on their causethe monster whom i had created the miserable dæmon whom i had sent abroad into the world for my destruction i was possessed by a maddening rage when i thought of him and desired and ardently prayed that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes i began to reflect on the best means of securing him and for this purpose about a month after my release i repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that i had an accusation to make that i knew the destroyer of my family and that i required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer the magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness be assured sir said he no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain i thank you replied i listen therefore to the deposition that i have to make it is indeed a tale so strange that i should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which however wonderful forces conviction the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream and i have no motive for falsehood my manner as i thus addressed him was impressive but calm i had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life i now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous but as i continued he became more attentive and interested i saw him sometimes shudder with horror at others a lively surprise unmingled with disbelief was painted on his countenance when i had concluded my narration i said this is the being whom i accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power it is your duty as a magistrate and i believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion this address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor he had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence the whole tide of his incredulity returned he however answered mildly i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude besides some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey but i perceive your thoughts you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert as i spoke rage sparkled in my eyes the magistrate was intimidated you are mistaken said he i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes but i fear from what you have yourself described to be his properties that this will prove impracticable and thus while every proper measure is pursued you should make up your mind to disappointment that cannot be but all that i can say will be of little avail my revenge is of no moment to you yet while i allow it to be a vice i confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul my rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer whom i have turned loose upon society still exists you refuse my just demand i have but one resource and i devote myself either in my life or death to his destruction i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this there was a frenzy in my manner and something i doubt not of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed but to a genevan magistrate whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness he endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium man i cried how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom cease you know not what it is you say i broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action chapter my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost i was hurried away by fury revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion my first resolution was to quit geneva for ever my country which when i was happy and beloved was dear to me now in my adversity became hateful i provided myself with a sum of money together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother and departed and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life i have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet how i have lived i hardly know many times have i stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death but revenge kept me alive i dared not die and leave my adversary in being when i quitted geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which i might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy but my plan was unsettled and i wandered many hours round the confines of the town uncertain what path i should pursue as night approached i found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where william elizabeth and my father reposed i entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves everything was silent except the leaves of the trees which were gently agitated by the wind the night was nearly dark and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow which was felt but not seen around the head of the mourner the deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair they were dead and i lived their murderer also lived and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence i knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed by the sacred earth on which i kneel by the shades that wander near me by the deep and eternal grief that i feel i swear and by thee o night and the spirits that preside over thee to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery until he or i shall perish in mortal conflict for this purpose i will preserve my life to execute this dear revenge will i again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever and i call on you spirits of the dead and on you wandering ministers of vengeance to aid and conduct me in my work let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony let him feel the despair that now torments me i had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion but the furies possessed me as i concluded and rage choked my utterance i was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh it rang on my ears long and heavily the mountains reechoed it and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter surely in that moment i should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that i was reserved for vengeance the laughter died away when a wellknown and abhorred voice apparently close to my ear addressed me in an audible whisper i am satisfied miserable wretch you have determined to live and i am satisfied i darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded but the devil eluded my grasp suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed i pursued him and for many months this has been my task guided by a slight clue i followed the windings of the rhone but vainly the blue mediterranean appeared and by a strange chance i saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the black sea i took my passage in the same ship but he escaped i know not how amidst the wilds of tartary and russia although he still evaded me i have ever followed in his track sometimes the peasants scared by this horrid apparition informed me of his path sometimes he himself who feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die left some mark to guide me the snows descended on my head and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plain to you first entering on life to whom care is new and agony unknown how can you understand what i have felt and still feel cold want and fatigue were the least pains which i was destined to endure i was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when i most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties sometimes when nature overcome by hunger sank under the exhaustion a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me the fare was indeed coarse such as the peasants of the country ate but i will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that i had invoked to aid me often when all was dry the heavens cloudless and i was parched by thirst a slight cloud would bedim the sky shed the few drops that revived me and vanish i followed when i could the courses of the rivers but the dæmon generally avoided these as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected in other places human beings were seldom seen and i generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path i had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it or i brought with me some food that i had killed which after taking a small part i always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking my life as it passed thus was indeed hateful to me and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy o blessed sleep often when most miserable i sank to repose and my dreams lulled me even to rapture the spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage deprived of this respite i should have sunk under my hardships during the day i was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friends my wife and my beloved country again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father heard the silver tones of my elizabeths voice and beheld clerval enjoying health and youth often when wearied by a toilsome march i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends what agonising fondness did i feel for them how did i cling to their dear forms as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours and persuade myself that they still lived at such moments vengeance that burned within me died in my heart and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious than as the ardent desire of my soul what his feelings were whom i pursued i cannot know sometimes indeed he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury my reign is not yet overthese words were legible in one of these inscriptionsyou live and my power is complete follow me i seek the everlasting ices of the north where you will feel the misery of cold and frost to which i am impassive you will find near this place if you follow not too tardily a dead hare eat and be refreshed come on my enemy we have yet to wrestle for our lives but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive scoffing devil again do i vow vengeance again do i devote thee miserable fiend to torture and death never will i give up my search until he or i perish and then with what ecstasy shall i join my elizabeth and my departed friends who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage as i still pursued my journey to the northward the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support the peasants were shut up in their hovels and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hidingplaces to seek for prey the rivers were covered with ice and no fish could be procured and thus i was cut off from my chief article of maintenance the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours one inscription that he left was in these words prepare your toils only begin wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words i resolved not to fail in my purpose and calling on heaven to support me i continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon oh how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south covered with ice it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness the greeks wept for joy when they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils i did not weep but i knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where i hoped notwithstanding my adversarys gibe to meet and grapple with him some weeks before this period i had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed i know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages but i found that as before i had daily lost ground in the pursuit i now gained on him so much so that when i first saw the ocean he was but one days journey in advance and i hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach with new courage therefore i pressed on and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore i inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information a gigantic monster they said had arrived the night before armed with a gun and many pistols putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance he had carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs he had harnessed them and the same night to the joy of the horrorstruck villagers had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts on hearing this information i suffered a temporary access of despair he had escaped me and i must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which i the native of a genial and sunny climate could not hope to survive yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant my rage and vengeance returned and like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge i prepared for my journey i exchanged my landsledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the frozen ocean and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions i departed from land i cannot guess how many days have passed since then but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage and i often heard the thunder of the ground sea which threatened my destruction but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure by the quantity of provision which i had consumed i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey and the continual protraction of hope returning back upon the heart often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes despair had indeed almost secured her prey and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain and one sinking under his fatigue died i viewed the expanse before me with anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain i strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a wellknown form within oh with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart warm tears filled my eyes which i hastily wiped away that they might not intercept the view i had of the dæmon but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops until giving way to the emotions that oppressed me i wept aloud but this was not the time for delay i disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion gave them a plentiful portion of food and after an hours rest which was absolutely necessary and yet which was bitterly irksome to me i continued my route the sledge was still visible nor did i again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some icerock concealed it with its intervening crags i indeed perceptibly gained on it and when after nearly two days journey i beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant my heart bounded within me but now when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe my hopes were suddenly extinguished and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before a ground sea was heard the thunder of its progress as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me became every moment more ominous and terrific i pressed on but in vain the wind arose the sea roared and as with the mighty shock of an earthquake it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound the work was soon finished in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death in this manner many appalling hours passed several of my dogs died and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship i had determined if you were going southwards still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose i hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which i could pursue my enemy but your direction was northwards you took me on board when my vigour was exhausted and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which i still dread for my task is unfulfilled oh when will my guiding spirit in conducting me to the dæmon allow me the rest i so much desire or must i die and he yet live if i do swear to me walton that he shall not escape that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone no i am not so selfish yet when i am dead if he should appear if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you swear that he shall not liveswear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes he is eloquent and persuasive and once his words had even power over my heart but trust him not his soul is as hellish as his form full of treachery and fiendlike malice hear him not call on the names of william justine clerval elizabeth my father and of the wretched victor and thrust your sword into his heart i will hover near and direct the steel aright walton _in continuation_ august th you have read this strange and terrific story margaret and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror like that which even now curdles mine sometimes seized with sudden agony he could not continue his tale at others his voice broken yet piercing uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish his fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice suppressing every mark of agitation then like a volcano bursting forth his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor his tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth yet i own to you that the letters of felix and safie which he showed me and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations however earnest and connected such a monster has then really existence i cannot doubt it yet i am lost in surprise and admiration sometimes i endeavoured to gain from frankenstein the particulars of his creatures formation but on this point he was impenetrable are you mad my friend said he or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy peace peace learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own frankenstein discovered that i made notes concerning his history he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy since you have preserved my narration said he i would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity thus has a week passed away while i have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed my thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created i wish to soothe him yet can i counsel one so infinitely miserable so destitute of every hope of consolation to live oh no the only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death yet he enjoys one comfort the offspring of solitude and delirium he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance that they are not the creations of his fancy but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world this faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes on every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension his eloquence is forcible and touching nor can i hear him when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love without tears what a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin he seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall when younger said he i believed myself destined for some great enterprise my feelings are profound but i possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements this sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed for i deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures when i reflected on the work i had completed no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal i could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors but this thought which supported me in the commencement of my career now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust all my speculations and hopes are as nothing and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence i am chained in an eternal hell my imagination was vivid yet my powers of analysis and application were intense by the union of these qualities i conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man even now i cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete i trod heaven in my thoughts now exulting in my powers now burning with the idea of their effects from my infancy i was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition but how am i sunk oh my friend if you had known me as i once was you would not recognise me in this state of degradation despondency rarely visited my heart a high destiny seemed to bear me on until i fell never never again to rise must i then lose this admirable being i have longed for a friend i have sought one who would sympathise with and love me behold on these desert seas i have found such a one but i fear i have gained him only to know his value and lose him i would reconcile him to life but he repulses the idea i thank you walton he said for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections think you that any can replace those who are gone can any man be to me as clerval was or any woman another elizabeth even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain they know our infantine dispositions which however they may be afterwards modified are never eradicated and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives a sister or a brother can never unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early suspect the other of fraud or false dealing when another friend however strongly he may be attached may in spite of himself be contemplated with suspicion but i enjoyed friends dear not only through habit and association but from their own merits and wherever i am the soothing voice of my elizabeth and the conversation of clerval will be ever whispered in my ear they are dead and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life if i were engaged in any high undertaking or design fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures then could i live to fulfil it but such is not my destiny i must pursue and destroy the being to whom i gave existence then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and i may die my beloved sister september d i write to you encompassed by peril and ignorant whether i am ever doomed to see again dear england and the dearer friends that inhabit it i am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel the brave fellows whom i have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid but i have none to bestow there is something terribly appalling in our situation yet my courage and hopes do not desert me yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me if we are lost my mad schemes are the cause and what margaret will be the state of your mind you will not hear of my destruction and you will anxiously await my return years will pass and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope oh my beloved sister the sickening failing of your heartfelt expectations is in prospect more terrible to me than my own death but you have a husband and lovely children you may be happy heaven bless you and make you so my unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion he endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued he reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea and in spite of myself he fills me with cheerful auguries even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence when he speaks they no longer despair he rouses their energies and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are molehills which will vanish before the resolutions of man these feelings are transitory each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear and i almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair september th a scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you yet i cannot forbear recording it we are still surrounded by mountains of ice still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict the cold is excessive and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation frankenstein has daily declined in health a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes but he is exhausted and when suddenly roused to any exertion he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness i mentioned in my last letter the fears i entertained of a mutiny this morning as i sat watching the wan countenance of my friendhis eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlesslyi was roused by half a dozen of the sailors who demanded admission into the cabin they entered and their leader addressed me he told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which in justice i could not refuse we were immured in ice and should probably never escape but they feared that if as was possible the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened i should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers after they might happily have surmounted this they insisted therefore that i should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed i would instantly direct my course southwards this speech troubled me i had not despaired nor had i yet conceived the idea of returning if set free yet could i in justice or even in possibility refuse this demand i hesitated before i answered when frankenstein who had at first been silent and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend now roused himself his eyes sparkled and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour turning towards the men he said what do you mean what do you demand of your captain are you then so easily turned from your design did you not call this a glorious expedition and wherefore was it glorious not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea but because it was full of dangers and terror because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited because danger and death surrounded it and these you were to brave and overcome for this was it a glorious for this was it an honourable undertaking you were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind and now behold with the first imagination of danger or if you will the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril and so poor souls they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides why that requires not this preparation ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards oh be men or be more than men be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock this ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe he spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism that can you wonder that these men were moved they looked at one another and were unable to reply i spoke i told them to retire and consider of what had been said that i would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary but that i hoped that with reflection their courage would return they retired and i turned towards my friend but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life how all this will terminate i know not but i had rather die than return shamefully my purpose unfulfilled yet i fear such will be my fate the men unsupported by ideas of glory and honour can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships september th the die is cast i have consented to return if we are not destroyed thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision i come back ignorant and disappointed it requires more philosophy than i possess to bear this injustice with patience september th it is past i am returning to england i have lost my hopes of utility and glory i have lost my friend but i will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you my dear sister and while i am wafted towards england and towards you i will not despond september th the ice began to move and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction we were in the most imminent peril but as we could only remain passive my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed the ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north a breeze sprang from the west and on the th the passage towards the south became perfectly free when the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them loud and longcontinued frankenstein who was dozing awoke and asked the cause of the tumult they shout i said because they will soon return to england do you then really return alas yes i cannot withstand their demands i cannot lead them unwillingly to danger and i must return do so if you will but i will not you may give up your purpose but mine is assigned to me by heaven and i dare not i am weak but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength saying this he endeavoured to spring from the bed but the exertion was too great for him he fell back and fainted it was long before he was restored and i often thought that life was entirely extinct at length he opened his eyes he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak the surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed in the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live his sentence was pronounced and i could only grieve and be patient i sat by his bed watching him his eyes were closed and i thought he slept but presently he called to me in a feeble voice and bidding me come near said alas the strength i relied on is gone i feel that i shall soon die and he my enemy and persecutor may still be in being think not walton that in the last moments of my existence i feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge i once expressed but i feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary during these last days i have been occupied in examining my past conduct nor do i find it blamable in a fit of enthusiastic madness i created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure as far as was in my power his happiness and wellbeing this was my duty but there was another still paramount to that my duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery urged by this view i refused and i did right in refusing to create a companion for the first creature he showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil he destroyed my friends he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations happiness and wisdom nor do i know where this thirst for vengeance may end miserable himself that he may render no other wretched he ought to die the task of his destruction was mine but i have failed when actuated by selfish and vicious motives i asked you to undertake my unfinished work and i renew this request now when i am only induced by reason and virtue yet i cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task and now that you are returning to england you will have little chance of meeting with him but the consideration of these points and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties i leave to you my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death i dare not ask you to do what i think right for i may still be misled by passion that he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me in other respects this hour when i momentarily expect my release is the only happy one which i have enjoyed for several years the forms of the beloved dead flit before me and i hasten to their arms farewell walton seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries yet why do i say this i have myself been blasted in these hopes yet another may succeed his voice became fainter as he spoke and at length exhausted by his effort he sank into silence about half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable he pressed my hand feebly and his eyes closed for ever while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips margaret what comment can i make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit what can i say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow all that i should express would be inadequate and feeble my tears flow my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment but i journey towards england and i may there find consolation i am interrupted what do these sounds portend it is midnight the breeze blows fairly and the watch on deck scarcely stir again there is a sound as of a human voice but hoarser it comes from the cabin where the remains of frankenstein still lie i must arise and examine good night my sister great god what a scene has just taken place i am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it i hardly know whether i shall have the power to detail it yet the tale which i have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe i entered the cabin where lay the remains of my illfated and admirable friend over him hung a form which i cannot find words to describegigantic in stature yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions as he hung over the coffin his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair but one vast hand was extended in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy when he heard the sound of my approach he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window never did i behold a vision so horrible as his face of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness i shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer i called on him to stay he paused looking on me with wonder and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator he seemed to forget my presence and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion that is also my victim he exclaimed in his murder my crimes are consummated the miserable series of my being is wound to its close oh frankenstein generous and selfdevoted being what does it avail that i now ask thee to pardon me i who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst alas he is cold he cannot answer me his voice seemed suffocated and my first impulses which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion i approached this tremendous being i dared not again raise my eyes to his face there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness i attempted to speak but the words died away on my lips the monster continued to utter wild and incoherent selfreproaches at length i gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion your repentance i said is now superfluous if you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity frankenstein would yet have lived and do you dream said the dæmon do you think that i was then dead to agony and remorse he he continued pointing to the corpse he suffered not in the consummation of the deed oh not the tenthousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution a frightful selfishness hurried me on while my heart was poisoned with remorse think you that the groans of clerval were music to my ears my heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine after the murder of clerval i returned to switzerland heartbroken and overcome i pitied frankenstein my pity amounted to horror i abhorred myself but when i discovered that he the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments dared to hope for happiness that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which i was for ever barred then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance i recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished i knew that i was preparing for myself a deadly torture but i was the slave not the master of an impulse which i detested yet could not disobey yet when she died nay then i was not miserable i had cast off all feeling subdued all anguish to riot in the excess of my despair evil thenceforth became my good urged thus far i had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which i had willingly chosen the completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion and now it is ended there is my last victim i was at first touched by the expressions of his misery yet when i called to mind what frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion and when i again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend indignation was rekindled within me wretch i said it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made you throw a torch into a pile of buildings and when they are consumed you sit among the ruins and lament the fall hypocritical fiend if he whom you mourn still lived still would he be the object again would he become the prey of your accursed vengeance it is not pity that you feel you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power oh it is not thusnot thus interrupted the being yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions yet i seek not a fellow feeling in my misery no sympathy may i ever find when i first sought it it was the love of virtue the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed that i wished to be participated but now that virtue has become to me a shadow and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair in what should i seek for sympathy i am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure when i die i am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue of fame and of enjoyment once i falsely hoped to meet with beings who pardoning my outward form would love me for the excellent qualities which i was capable of unfolding i was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion but now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal no guilt no mischief no malignity no misery can be found comparable to mine when i run over the frightful catalogue of my sins i cannot believe that i am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness but it is even so the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil yet even that enemy of god and man had friends and associates in his desolation i am alone you who call frankenstein your friend seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes but in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which i endured wasting in impotent passions for while i destroyed his hopes i did not satisfy my own desires they were for ever ardent and craving still i desired love and fellowship and i was still spurned was there no injustice in this am i to be thought the only criminal when all humankind sinned against me why do you not hate felix who drove his friend from his door with contumely why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child nay these are virtuous and immaculate beings i the miserable and the abandoned am an abortion to be spurned at and kicked and trampled on even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice but it is true that i am a wretch i have murdered the lovely and the helpless i have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing i have devoted my creator the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men to misery i have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin there he lies white and cold in death you hate me but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which i regard myself i look on the hands which executed the deed i think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more fear not that i shall be the instrument of future mischief my work is nearly complete neither yours nor any mans death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done but it requires my own do not think that i shall be slow to perform this sacrifice i shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe i shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as i have been i shall die i shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied yet unquenched he is dead who called me into being and when i shall be no more the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish i shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks light feeling and sense will pass away and in this condition must i find my happiness some years ago when the images which this world affords first opened upon me when i felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds and these were all to me i should have wept to die now it is my only consolation polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse where can i find rest but in death farewell i leave you and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold farewell frankenstein if thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction but it was not so thou didst seek my extinction that i might not cause greater wretchedness and if yet in some mode unknown to me thou hadst not ceased to think and feel thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which i feel blasted as thou wert my agony was still superior to thine for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever but soon he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm i shall die and what i now feel be no longer felt soon these burning miseries will be extinct i shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames the light of that conflagration will fade away my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds my spirit will sleep in peace or if it thinks it will not surely think thus farewell he sprang from the cabinwindow as he said this upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel he was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance

_has perhaps the fewest outandout admirers but it does not want them_ _i suppose however that the majority of at least competent votes would all things considered be divided between_ emma _and the present book and perhaps the vulgar verdict if indeed a fondness for miss austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge of vulgarity would go for_ emma _it is the larger the more varied the more popular the author had by the time of its composition seen rather more of the world and had improved her general though not her most peculiar and characteristic dialogue such figures as miss bates as the eltons cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody on the other hand i for my part declare for_ pride and prejudice _unhesitatingly it seems to me the most perfect the most characteristic the most eminently quintessential of its authors works and for this contention in such narrow space as is permitted to me i propose here to show cause_ _in the first place the book it may be barely necessary to remind the reader was in its first shape written very early somewhere about when miss austen was barely twentyone though it was revised and finished at chawton some fifteen years later and was not published till only four years before her death i do not know whether in this combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth and the critical revision of middle life there may be traced the distinct superiority in point of construction which as it seems to me it possesses over all the others the plot though not elaborate is almost regular enough for fielding hardly a character hardly an incident could be retrenched without loss to the story the elopement of lydia and wickham is not like that of crawford and mrs rushworth a_ coup de théâtre _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the story earlier and brings about the denouement with complete propriety all the minor passagesthe loves of jane and bingley the advent of mr collins the visit to hunsford the derbyshire tourfit in after the same unostentatious but masterly fashion there is no attempt at the hideandseek inandout business which in the transactions between frank churchill and jane fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the intrigue of_ emma _but contributes it in a fashion which i do not think the best feature of that otherwise admirable book although miss austen always liked something of the misunderstanding kind which afforded her opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to be noticed presently she has been satisfied here with the perfectly natural occasions provided by the false account of darcys conduct given by wickham and by the awkwardness arising with equal naturalness from the gradual transformation of elizabeths own feelings from positive aversion to actual love i do not know whether the allgrasping hand of the playwright has ever been laid upon_ pride and prejudice _and i dare say that if it were the situations would prove not startling or garish enough for the footlights the characterscheme too subtle and delicate for pit and gallery but if the attempt were made it would certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction which sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can avail himself appear at once on the stage_ _i think however though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to more than one school of critics that construction is not the highest merit the choicest gift of the novelist it sets off his other gifts and graces most advantageously to the critical eye and the want of it will sometimes mar those gracesappreciably though not quite consciouslyto eyes by no means ultracritical but a very badlybuilt novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character or which displayed consummate command of dialogueperhaps the rarest of all facultieswould be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths and despite the ability which miss austen has shown in working out the story i for one should put_ pride and prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what seem to me the very masterpieces of miss austens humour and of her faculty of charactercreationmasterpieces who may indeed admit john thorpe the eltons mrs norris and one or two others to their company but who in one instance certainly and perhaps in others are still superior to them_ _the characteristics of miss austens humour are so subtle and delicate that they are perhaps at all times easier to apprehend than to express and at any particular time likely to be differently apprehended by different persons to me this humour seems to possess a greater affinity on the whole to that of addison than to any other of the numerous species of this great british genus the differences of scheme of time of subject of literary convention are of course obvious enough the difference of sex does not perhaps count for much for there was a distinctly feminine element in mr spectator and in jane austens genius there was though nothing mannish much that was masculine but the likeness of quality consists in a great number of common subdivisions of qualitydemureness extreme minuteness of touch avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects also there is in both a certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty it is the custom with those who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of addison with the savagery of swift the mildness of miss austen with the boisterousness of fielding and smollett even with the ferocious practical jokes that her immediate predecessor miss burney allowed without very much protest yet both in mr addison and in miss austen there is though a restrained and wellmannered an insatiable and ruthless delight in roasting and cutting up a fool a man in the early eighteenth century of course could push this taste further than a lady in the early nineteenth and no doubt miss austens principles as well as her heart would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate husband in the_ spectator _who describes with all the gusto and all the innocence in the world how his wife and his friend induce him to play at blindmansbuff but another_ spectator _letterthat of the damsel of fourteen who wishes to marry mr shapely and assures her selected mentor that he admires your_ spectators _mightilymight have been written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent lydia bennet in the days of lydias greatgrandmother while on the other hand some i think unreasonably have found cynicism in touches of miss austens own such as her satire of mrs musgroves selfdeceiving regrets over her son but this word cynical is one of the most misused in the english language especially when by a glaring and gratuitous falsification of its original sense it is applied not to rough and snarling invective but to gentle and oblique satire if cynicism means the perception of the other side the sense of the accepted hells beneath the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed and that to seem is not identical with to beif this be cynicism then every man and woman who is not a fool who does not care to live in a fools paradise who has knowledge of nature and the world and life is a cynic and in that sense miss austen certainly was one she may even have been one in the further sense that like her own mr bennet she took an epicurean delight in dissecting in displaying in setting at work her fools and her mean persons i think she did take this delight and i do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman while she was immensely the better for it as an artist_ _in respect of her art generally mr goldwin smith has truly observed that metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it combined with the narrowness of her field and he has justly added that we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature painter to make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the term miniature in its restricted sense and must think rather of memling at one end of the history of painting and meissonier at the other than of cosway or any of his kind and i am not so certain that i should myself use the word narrow in connection with her if her world is a microcosm the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the littleness she does not touch what she did not feel herself called to paint i am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not feel herself called to touch it is at least remarkable that in two very short periods of writingone of about three years and another of not much more than fiveshe executed six capital works and has not left a single failure it is possible that the romantic paste in her composition was defective we must always remember that hardly anybody born in her decadethat of the eighteenthcentury seventiesindependently exhibited the full romantic quality even scott required hill and mountain and ballad even coleridge metaphysics and german to enable them to chip the classical shell miss austen was an english girl brought up in a country retirement at the time when ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might pierce their kid shoes when a sudden cold was the subject of the gravest fears when their studies their ways their conduct were subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which mary wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular taste or judgment miss austen too drew back when the white frost touched her shoes but i think she would have made a pretty good journey even in a black one_ _for if her knowledge was not very extended she knew two things which only genius knows the one was humanity and the other was art on the first head she could not make a mistake her men though limited are true and her women are in the old sense absolute as to art if she has never tried idealism her realism is real to a degree which makes the false realism of our own day look merely deadalive take almost any frenchman except the late m de maupassant and watch him laboriously piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression you get none you are lucky if discarding twothirds of what he gives you can shape a real impression out of the rest but with miss austen the myriad trivial unforced strokes build up the picture like magic nothing is false nothing is superfluous when to take the present book only mr collins changed his mind from jane to elizabeth while mrs bennet was stirring the fire and we know_ how _mrs bennet would have stirred the fire when mr darcy brought his coffeecup back_ himself _the touch in each case is like that of swifttaller by the breadth of my nailwhich impressed the halfreluctant thackeray with just and outspoken admiration indeed fantastic as it may seem i should put miss austen as near to swift in some ways as i have put her to addison in others_ _this swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears nowhere else in the character of the immortal the ineffable mr collins mr collins is really_ great _far greater than anything addison ever did almost great enough for fielding or for swift himself it has been said that no one ever was like him but in the first place_ he _was like him he is therealive imperishable more real than hundreds of prime ministers and archbishops of metals semimetals and distinguished philosophers in the second place it is rash i think to conclude that an actual mr collins was impossible or nonexistent at the end of the eighteenth century it is very interesting that we possess in this same gallery what may be called a spoiled first draught or an unsuccessful study of him in john dashwood the formality the underbreeding the meanness are there but the portrait is only half alive and is felt to be even a little unnatural mr collins is perfectly natural and perfectly alive in fact for all the miniature there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain side and more than one of humanity and especially eighteenthcentury humanity its philistinism its wellmeaning but hidebound morality its formal pettiness its grovelling respect for rank its materialism its selfishness receives exhibition i will not admit that one speech or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled with reality and i should not wonder if many of these words and actions are historically true_ _but the greatness of mr collins could not have been so satisfactorily exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the figures of mr bennet and of lady catherine de bourgh the latter like mr collins himself has been charged with exaggeration there is perhaps a very faint shade of colour for the charge but it seems to me very faint indeed even now i do not think that it would be impossible to find persons especially female persons not necessarily of noble birth as overbearing as selfcentred as neglectful of good manners as lady catherine a hundred years ago an earls daughter the lady powerful if not exactly bountiful of an outoftheway country parish rich long out of marital authority and so forth had opportunities of developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present themselves now as for mr bennet miss austen and mr darcy and even miss elizabeth herself were i am inclined to think rather hard on him for the impropriety of his conduct his wife was evidently and must always have been a quite irreclaimable fool and unless he had shot her or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but the ironic from no other point of view is he open to any reproach except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of the elopement and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the consciously humorous kindin the kind that we laugh with not atthat even miss austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters it is difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife or when putting mr collins through his paces but the general sense of the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves that_ i _may be the survivor and his inquiry to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which mr collins has just related as made by himself to lady catherine may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study these are the things which give miss austens readers the pleasant shocks the delightful thrills which are felt by the readers of swift of fielding and we may here add of thackeray as they are felt by the readers of no other english author of fiction outside of these four_ _the goodness of the minor characters in_ pride and prejudice _has been already alluded to and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties difficult in any space and impossible in this mrs bennet we have glanced at and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely amusing or more horribly true much the same may be said of kitty and lydia but it is not every author even of genius who would have differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common weaknesses of woman at such different ages with mary miss austen has taken rather less pains though she has been even more unkind to her not merely in the text but as we learn from those interesting traditional appendices which mr austen leigh has given us in dooming her privately to marry one of mr philipss clerks the habits of first copying and then retailing moral sentiments of playing and singing too long in public are no doubt grievous and criminal but perhaps poor mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings in that fordycebelectured generation it is at any rate difficult not to extend to her a share of the respect and affection affection and respect of a peculiar kind doubtless with which one regards mr collins when she draws the moral of lydias fall i sometimes wish that the exigencies of the story had permitted miss austen to unite these personages and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe poor mrs bennets anguish over the entail_ _the bingleys and the gardiners and the lucases miss darcy and miss de bourgh jane wickham and the rest must pass without special comment further than the remark that charlotte lucas her egregious papa though delightful is just a little on the thither side of the line between comedy and farce is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind and that wickham though something of miss austens hesitation of touch in dealing with young men appears is a not much less notable sketch in drab of another only genius could have made charlotte what she is yet not disagreeable wickham what he is without investing him either with a cheap don juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality but the hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed_ _darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of miss austens heroes the only possible competitor being henry tilney whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into comparison it has sometimes i believe been urged that his pride is unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding while his falling in love at all is not extremely probable here again i cannot go with the objectors darcys own account of the way in which his pride had been pampered is perfectly rational and sufficient and nothing could be psychologically speaking a_ causa verior _for its sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of elizabeths scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous nothing in even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of pemberley had he been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb he might have been still smarting under his rejection or suspicious that the girl had come husbandhunting his being neither is exactly consistent with the probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense but not really injured in disposition and thoroughly in love as for his being in love elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that phenomenon as darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal charm_ _the secret of that charm many men and not a few women from miss austen herself downwards have felt and like most charms it is a thing rather to be felt than to be explained elizabeth of course belongs to the_ allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of venus miss austen was always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties and except the fine eyes and a hint or two that she had at any rate sometimes a bright complexion and was not very tall we hear nothing about her looks but her chief difference from other heroines of the lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly cleveralmost strongminded in the better sense of that objectionable wordand secondly in her being entirely destitute of illnature for all her propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue elizabeth can give at least as good as she gets when she is attacked but she never scratches and she never attacks first some of the merest obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early speeches a slight pertness but that is nothing and when she comes to serious business as in the great proposal scene with darcy which is as it should be the climax of the interest of the book and in the final ladies battle with lady catherine she is unexceptionable then too she is a perfectly natural girl she does not disguise from herself or anybody that she resents darcys first illmannered personality with as personal a feeling by the way the reproach that the illmanners of this speech are overdone is certainly unjust for things of the same kind expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely might have been heard in more than one ballroom during this very year from persons who ought to have been no worse bred than darcy and she lets the injury done to jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world_ _still all this does not explain her charm which taking beauty as a common form of all heroines may perhaps consist in the addition to her playfulness her wit her affectionate and natural disposition of a certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent darcy nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the idea of proposals even naughty ones from the fascinating wickham elizabeth with nothing offensive nothing_ viraginous _nothing of the new woman about her has by nature what the best modern not new women have by education and experience a perfect freedom from the idea that all men may bully her if they choose and that most will away with her if they can though not in the least impudent and mannish grown she has no mere sensibility no nasty niceness about her the form of passion common and likely to seem natural in miss austens day was so invariably connected with the display of one or the other or both of these qualities that she has not made elizabeth outwardly passionate but i at least have not the slightest doubt that she would have married darcy just as willingly without pemberley as with it and anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked to the della cruscans of their own day and perhaps do look to the della cruscans of this_ _and after all what is the good of seeking for the reason of charmit is there there were better sense in the sad mechanic exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not in the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love there are at least five with whom as it seems to me no man of taste and spirit can help doing so their names are in chronological order elizabeth bennet diana vernon argemone lavington beatrix esmond and barbara grant i should have been most in love with beatrix and argemone i should i think for mere occasional companionship have preferred diana and barbara

views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last mr bennet replied that he had not but it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about it mr bennet made no answer do not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently _you_ want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it illustration he came down to see the place _copyright by george allen_ this was invitation enough why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week what is his name bingley is he married or single oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls how so how can it affect them my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them is that his design in settling here design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes i see no occasion for that you and the girls may goor you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the party my dear you flatter me i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now when a woman has five grownup daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood it is more than i engage for i assure you but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girlsthough i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so goodhumoured as lydia but you are always giving _her_ the preference they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take delight in vexing me you have no compassion on my poor nerves you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least ah you do not know what i suffer but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character _her_ mind was less difficult to develope she was a woman of mean understanding

mrs bennet _copyright by george allen_ illustration i hope mr bingley will like it _copyright by george allen_ chapter ii illustration mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy we are not in a way to know _what_ mr bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully when is your next ball to be lizzy tomorrow fortnight ay so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to _her_ impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teasing i honour your circumspection a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if _we_ do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsense nonsense what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you _there_ what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr bingley i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife i am sorry to hear _that_ but why did you not tell me so before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wishedthat of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day but for your sakes we would do anything lydia my love though you _are_ the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i _am_ the youngest im the tallest the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner illustration im the tallest illustration he rode a black horse chapter iii illustration not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas her report was highly favourable sir william had been delighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party nothing could be more delightful to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr bingleys heart were entertained if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation etc mrs bennet was quite disconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might always be flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his illustration when the party entered _copyright by george allen_ being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin and when the party entered the assemblyroom it consisted of only five altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man mr bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion his brotherinlaw mr hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield such amiable qualities must speak for themselves what a contrast between him and his friend mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party his character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better dance i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty _you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you illustration she is tolerable _copyright by george allen_ which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me mr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way elizabeth felt janes pleasure mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants they found mr bennet still up with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there jane was so admired nothing could be like it everybody said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice only think of _that_ my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance so he inquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the _boulanger_ if he had had any compassion for _me_ cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for gods sake say no more of his partners o that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance oh my dear continued mrs bennet i am quite delighted with him he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses i dare say the lace upon mrs hursts gown here she was interrupted again mr bennet protested against any description of finery she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your setdowns i quite detest the man illustration chapter iv illustration when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him he is just what a youngman ought to be said she sensible goodhumoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby complete i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment did not you _i_ did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take _you_ by surprise and _me_ never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person dear lizzy oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in anybody all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life i would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone but i always speak what i think i know you do and it is _that_ which makes the wonder with _your_ good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough one meets with it everywhere but to be candid without ostentation or designto take the good of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothing of the badbelongs to you alone and so you like this mans sisters too do you their manners are not equal to his certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in goodhumour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it mr bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion in understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose illustration _copyright by george allen_ chapter v illustration within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st jamess had made him courteous lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet they had several children the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was elizabeths intimate friend that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate _you_ began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civil selfcommand to miss lucas _you_ were mr bingleys first choice yes but he seemed to like his second better oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe he _did_i heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomething about mr robinson perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and _which_ he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point upon my word well that was very decided indeedthat does seem as ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know _my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_ eliza said charlotte mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just _tolerable_ i beg you will not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips illustration without once opening his lips _copyright by george allen_ are you quite sure maam is not there a little mistake said jane i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her ay because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance with _them_ he is remarkably agreeable i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with _him_ if i were you i believe maam i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him his pride said miss lucas does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a _right_ to be proud that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive _his_ pride if he had not mortified _mine_ pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonymously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit illustration illustration chapter vi illustration the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visit was returned in due form miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration it was generally evident whenever they met that he _did_ admire her and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all _begin_ freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show _more_ affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if _i_ can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavor to conceal it he must find it out perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character not as you represent it had she merely _dined_ with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent togetherand four evenings may do a great deal yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself occupied in observing mr bingleys attention to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others his doing so drew her notice it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster that is a question which mr darcy only can answer but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him illustration the entreaties of several _copyright by george allen_ on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic you are severe on us it will be _her_ turn soon to be teased said miss lucas i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows you are a very strange creature by way of a friendalways wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancing at mr darcy there is a very fine old saying which everybody here is of course familiar withkeep your breath to cool your porridgeand i shall keep mine to swell my song her performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy there is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance sir william only smiled your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do you often dance at st jamess never sir do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it you have a house in town i conclude mr darcy bowed i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner elizabeth looked archly and turned away her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie i should imagine not you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noisethe nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections mr darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley i am all astonishment how long has she been such a favourite and pray when am i to wish you joy that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me joy nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled you will have a charming motherinlaw indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed along illustration a note for miss bennet _copyright by george allen_ chapter vii illustration mr bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds she had a sister married to a mr philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the headquarters their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves mr philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly of anybodys children it should not be of my own however if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals mamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud nind my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days _têteàtête_ between two women can never end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on the receipt of this my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers yours ever caroline bingley with the officers cried lydia i wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_ dining out said mrs bennet that is very unlucky can i have the carriage said jane no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingleys chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs i had much rather go in the coach but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they illustration cheerful prognostics they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them but if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers purpose will be answered she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth nind my dearest lizzie i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better they insist also on my seeing mr jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meand excepting a sore throat and a headache there is not much the matter with me yours etc well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessif she should dieit would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders oh i am not at all afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage elizabeth feeling really anxious determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative she declared her resolution how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise she was shown into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it she was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politenessthere was goodhumour and kindness mr darcy said very little and mr hurst nothing at all the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone the latter was thinking only of his breakfast her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with elizabeth silently attended her when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern at parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was despatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes illustration the apothecary came illustration covering a screen chapter viii illustration at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at halfpast six elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil inquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley she could not make a very favourable answer jane was by no means better the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others she had very little notice from any but him miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeeda mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty mrs hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker i shall never forget her appearance this morning she really looked almost wild she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why must _she_ be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowzy yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice _you_ observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition certainly not to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most countrytown indifference to decorum it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again i have an excessive regard for jane bennetshe is really a very sweet girland i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself on entering the drawingroom she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book mr hurst looked at her with astonishment do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am _not_ a great reader and i have pleasure in many things in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever looked into elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations and then you have added so much to it yourselfyou are always buying books i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place charles when you build _your_ house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley i wish it may but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it i am talking of possibilities charles upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the cardtable and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather taller how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover screens and net purses i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than halfadozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished nor i i am sure said miss bingley then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman yes i do comprehend a great deal in it oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved all this she must possess added darcy and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_ are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this _i_ never saw such a woman _i_ never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i daresay it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her bingley urged mr joness being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister illustration mrs bennet and her two youngest girls _copyright by george allen_ chapter ix illustration elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation the note was immediately despatched and its contents as quickly complied with mrs bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected indeed i have sir was her answer she is a great deal too ill to be moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass a little longer on your kindness removed cried bingley it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_ you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her oh yesi understand you perfectly i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study yes but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing they have at least that advantage the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either ay that is because you have the right disposition but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with fourandtwenty families nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir william is mr bingleyis not he so much the man of fashion so genteel and so easy he has always something to say to everybody _that_ is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter did charlotte dine with you no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mincepies for my part mr bingley _i_ always keep servants that can do their own work _my_ daughters are brought up differently but everybody is to judge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that _i_ think charlotte so _very_ plain but then she is our particular friend she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me janes beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see anybody better looking it is what everybody says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love said darcy of a fine stout healthy love it may everything nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mothers ear i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill lydia declared herself satisfied oh yesit would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given _your_ ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on _fine eyes_ illustration chapter x illustration the day passed much as the day before had done mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawingroom the loo table however did not appear mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and mrs hurst was observing their game elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter he made no answer you write uncommonly fast you are mistaken i write rather slowly how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year letters of business too how odious i should think them it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours pray tell your sister that i long to see her i have already told her so once by your desire i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend pens remarkably well thank youbut i always mend my own how can you contrive to write so even he was silent tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does _not_ write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy my style of writing is very different from yours oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies i daresay you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do ityou would probably not goand at another word might stay a month you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shown him off now much more than he did himself i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matterdarcy must speak for himself you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety to yield readilyeasilyto the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense i see your design bingley said his friend you dislike an argument and want to silence this perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some musicbooks that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked him too little to care for his approbation after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do you not feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel she smiled but made no answer he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare indeed i do not dare elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it to cure the younger girls of running after the officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses illustration no no stay where you are _copyright by george allen_ have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your greatuncle the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard you used us abominably ill answered mrs hurst running away without telling us that you were coming out then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself the path just admitted three mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are you are charmingly grouped and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth goodbye she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening illustration piling up the fire _copyright by george allen_ chapter xi illustration when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared their powers of conversation were considerable they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation he was full of joy and attention the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be farther from the door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone else elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the cardtablebut in vain she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennet miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcys progress through _his_ book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library no one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chooses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked up he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere what could he mean she was dying to know what could be his meaningand asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in anything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak you either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire oh shocking cried miss bingley i never heard anything so abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth we can all plague and punish one another tease himlaugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done but upon my honour i do _not_ i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_ tease calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr darcy may hug himself mr darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a laugh miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and best of mennay the wisest and best of their actionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of _them_ i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without perhaps that is not possible for anyone but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule such as vanity and pride yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pridewhere there is a real superiority of mindpride will be always under good regulation elizabeth turned away to hide a smile your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss bingley and pray what is the result i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it himself without disguise no said darcy i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever _that_ is a failing indeed cried elizabeth implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot _laugh_ at it you are safe from me there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share louisa you will not mind my waking mr hurst her sister made not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention illustration chapter xii illustration in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day but mrs bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape himnothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother mrs bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married illustration chapter xiii illustration i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger mrs bennets eyes sparkled a gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley i am sure why janeyou never dropped a word of thisyou sly thing well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley butgood lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got today lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this moment it is _not_ mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explainedabout a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear right hunsford near westerham kent _th october_ dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variancethere mrs bennetmy mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of goodwill are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologize for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november th by four oclock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday sennight following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your wellwisher and friend william collins at four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman said mr bennet as he folded up the letter he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required he must be an oddity i think said she i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as for their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her illwill and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family mr bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall heavylooking young man of fiveandtwenty his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so oddly you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess not that i mean to find fault with _you_ for such things i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other they were not the only objects of mr collinss admiration the hall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs bennets heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing but here he was set right by mrs bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen he begged pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour illustration chapter xiv illustration during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable mr bennet could not have chosen better mr collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closets upstairs that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her does she live near you sir the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyships residence i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property ah cried mrs bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay you judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible mr bennets expectations were fully answered his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure by teatime however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad to invite him illustration protested that he never read novels ht feb to read aloud to the ladies mr collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for everything announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyces sermons lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with do you know mamma that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr collins much offended laid aside his book and said i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon mr bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements mrs bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for lydias interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no illwill and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr bennet and prepared for backgammon illustration chapter xv illustration mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humility having now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part his plan did not vary on seeing them miss bennets lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hours _têteàtête_ with mrs bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on as to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to sayshe could not positively answerbut she did not _know_ of any prepossessionher _eldest_ daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soon donedone while mrs bennet was stirring the fire elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course mrs bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_ their eyes were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recall them but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed all were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot mr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best parts of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her mr darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting both changed colour one looked white the other red mr wickham after a few moments touched his hata salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return what could be the meaning of it it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know in another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philipss house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs philipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr joness shopboy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by janes introduction of him she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologizing for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the shire she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the streetand had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening this was agreed to and mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs philipss manners and politeness he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life illustration chapter xvi illustration as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroom that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and found that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece the interval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last however the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as _they_ were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room illustration the officers of the shire _copyright by george allen_ mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers mr collins seemed to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy she dared not even mention that gentleman her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved mr wickham began the subject himself he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in a hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand yes replied wickham his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myselffor i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy elizabeth could not but look surprised you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable i have no right to give _my_ opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked in hertfordshire everybody is disgusted with his pride you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seen i should take him even on _my_ slight acquaintance to be an illtempered man wickham only shook his head i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer i do not at all know but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood oh noit is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr darcy if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the worlda sense of very great illusage and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i know it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude i _must_ have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible the church _ought_ to have been my professioni was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now indeed yesthe late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere good heavens cried elizabeth but how could _that_ be how could his will be disregarded why did not you seek legal redress there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short anything or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him and _to_ him too freely i can recall nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced some time or other he _will_ bebut it shall not be by _me_ till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose _him_ elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them but what said she after a pause can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly a thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of preference which was often given me i had not thought mr darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of himi had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this after a few minutes reflection however she continued i _do_ remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be dreadful i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham _i_ can hardly be just to him elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his father she could have added a young man too like _you_ whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself withand one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care _my_ father began life in the profession which your uncle mr philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence and when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself how strange cried elizabeth how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor dishonesty i must call it it _is_ wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and _filial_ pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also _brotherly_ pride which with _some_ brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers what sort of a girl is miss darcy he shook his head i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brothervery very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she is nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her fathers death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems goodhumour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr bingley not at all he is a sweettempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr darcy is probably not but mr darcy can please where he chooses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberalminded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing something for fortune and figure the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these thingsand happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy no indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady catherines connections i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already selfdestined to another mr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickhams attentions there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philipss supper party but his manners recommended him to everybody whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully elizabeth went away with her head full of him she could think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and mrs philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house illustration delighted to see their dear friend again chapter xvii illustration elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr wickham and herself jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear _them_ too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody laugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a mannerone whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no i can much more easily believe mr bingleys being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts everything mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks it is difficult indeedit is distressing one does not know what to think i beg your pardonone knows exactly what to think but jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat mr bingley if he _had been_ imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr darcys look and behaviour the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her elizabeth felt herself completely taken in she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins insteadher liveliness had been never worse timed there was no help for it however mr wickhams happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more it now first struck her that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_ elizabeth however did not choose to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia illustration chapter xviii illustration till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked her but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification mr collins awkward and solemn apologizing instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give the moment of her release from him was ecstasy she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her i dare say you will find him very agreeable heaven forbid _that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance he replied and was again silent after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is _your_ turn to say something now mr darcy _i_ talked about the dance and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said very well that reply will do for the present perhaps byandby i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but _now_ we may be silent do you talk by rule then while you are dancing sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of _some_ conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he how near it may be to _mine_ i cannot pretend to say _you_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly i must not decide on my own performance he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance the effect was immediate a deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his _making_ friends whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them is less certain he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcybut let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me illustration such very superior dancing is not often seen _copyright by george allen_ the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine what think you of books said he smiling booksoh noi am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full of something else the _present_ always occupies you in such scenesdoes it said he with a look of doubt yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgavethat your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its _being created_ i am said he with a firm voice and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice i hope not it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first may i ask to what these questions tend merely to the illustration of _your_ character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity i am trying to make it out and what is your success she shook her head i do not get on at all i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly i can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcys breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcys steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcys steward and of _that_ i can assure you he informed me himself i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer excuse my interference it was kindly meant insolent girl said elizabeth to herself you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sisters mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys regard mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am perfectly satisfied but what does he say of the living he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr bingleys defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting withperhapsa nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy indeed i am i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady catherines _nephew_ it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which lead me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him to speak replied with an air of distant civility mr collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr collins then returned to elizabeth i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley it was an animating subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear for heavens sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing nothing that she could say however had any influence her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken elizabeth now began to revive but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisancebut in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected elizabeth was in agonies she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other young ladies have time to exhibit mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good others of the party were now applied to if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many staredmany smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed that his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable the rest of the evening brought her little amusement she was teased by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening there was no arguing upon such a project she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and goodnaturedly engaged mr collinss conversation to herself she was at least free from the offence of mr darcys further notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in it the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manœuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests darcy said nothing at all mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months of having another daughter married to mr collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield illustration to assure you in the most animated language chapter xix illustration the next day opened a new scene at longbourn mr collins made his declaration in form having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business on finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrs bennet instantly answered oh dear yes certainly i am sure lizzy will be very happyi am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you upstairs and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear maam do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear i am going away myself no no nonsense lizzy i desire you will stay where you are and upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr collins elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr collins began believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs footstoolthat she said mr collins you must marry a clergyman like you must marry choose properly choose a gentlewoman for _my_ sake and for your _own_ let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now you are too hasty sir she cried you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without further loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make _me_ happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr collins very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character really mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly theseit does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into further consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females i do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female illustration chapter xx illustration mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character this information however startled mrs bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe it and could not help saying so but depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason i will speak to her about it myself directly she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will _make_ her know it pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these in everything else she is as goodnatured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_ mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech of what are you talking of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy and what am i to do on the occasion it seems a hopeless business speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her marrying him let her be called down she shall hear my opinion mrs bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library come here child cried her father as she appeared i have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true elizabeth replied that it was very welland this offer of marriage you have refused i have sir very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your accepting it is it not so mrs bennet yes or i will never see her again an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you _do_ elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed what do you mean mr bennet by talking in this way you promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs bennet give up the point she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her manner varied however her determination never did mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him illustration they entered the breakfast room charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfastroom where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of her family pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth ay there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead _i_ shall not be able to keep youand so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to anybody people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so those who do not complain are never pitied her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected conversation oh mr collins my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologize illustration chapter xxi illustration the discussion of mr collinss offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother as for the gentleman himself _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets ill humour or ill health mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were well talked over to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been selfimposed i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcythat to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendations which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother illustration walked back with them _copyright by george allen_ soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hotpressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs when they had gained their own room jane taking out her letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again you shall hear what she says she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr hurst had a house the next was in these wordsi do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence i depend on you for that to these highflown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the crowd but of that i despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_ why will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master but you do not know _all_ i _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from _you_ mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any womans heart with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many what think you of _this_ sentence my dear lizzy said jane as she finished it is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it most willingly you shall have it in a few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you jane shook her head indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is thiswe are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him how can you talk so said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses illustration chapter xxii illustration the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception ofits object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday his reception however was of the most flattering kind miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever illustration so much love and eloquence _copyright by george allen_ excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st jamess the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary but still he would be her husband without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for welleducated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness my dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyships concurrence you cannot be too much on your guard risk anything rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before the possibility of mr collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mr collins my dear charlotte impossible the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collinss character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match the strangeness of mr collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mr collins was a most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen illustration protested he must be entirely mistaken _copyright by george allen_ chapter xxiii illustration elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family with many compliments to them and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams goodbreeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day nothing could console and nothing appease her nor did that day wear out her resentment a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter mr bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men mr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continued absence neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to janes happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment as for jane _her_ anxiety under this suspense was of course more painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very illused it needed all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved them from a great deal of his company the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed illustration _whenever she spoke in a low voice_ mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sight of miss lucas was odious to her as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet was dead she complained bitterly of all this to her husband indeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that _i_ should be forced to make way for _her_ and live to see her take my place in it my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the entail i should not mind it what should not you mind i should not mind anything at all let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility i never can be thankful mr bennet for anything about the entail how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins too why should _he_ have it more than anybody else i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet illustration chapter xxiv illustration miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying o that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i will not repine it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not _that_ pain a little time thereforei shall certainly try to get the better with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection nay said elizabeth this is not fair _you_ wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody _i_ only want to think _you_ perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal goodwill you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr collinss respectability and charlottes prudent steady character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for everybodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin to oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned _two_ instances i cannot misunderstand you but i entreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it does and men take care that they should if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine i am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution will do the business and do you impute it to either of those yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him yes in conjunction with his friend i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it your first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistakenor at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs bennets best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer mr bennet treated the matter differently so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect janes good fortune true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known anything of the matter miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men illustration chapter xxv illustration after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so wellbred and agreeable mrs gardiner who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with her longbourn nieces between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard they had frequently been staying with her in town the first part of mrs gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions when this was done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listen mrs bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of they had all been very illused since she last saw her sister two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collinss wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent illustration offended two or three young ladies _copyright by george allen_ an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for _us_ we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hours acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how _violent was_ mr bingleys love i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to _you_ lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her and _that_ is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without him so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane correspond with his sister _she_ will not be able to help calling she will drop the acquaintance entirely but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by carolines not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself on being made acquainted with the present mr darcys treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentlemans reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured boy illustration will you come and see me chapter xxvi illustration mrs gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against _him_ he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it isyou must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father my dear aunt this is being serious indeed yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it elizabeth you are not serious now i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to mei believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence of it oh _that_ abominable mr darcy my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellowcreatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wiser to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my best perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_ but do not imagine that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week you know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parteda wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she _wished_ they might be happy thursday was to be the weddingday and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room as they went down stairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza _that_ you certainly shall and i have another favour to ask will you come and see me we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to come to hunsford elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging it was mr collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost my aunt she continued is going tomorrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her i inquired after their brother of course he was well but so much engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was not long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out i dare say i shall soon see them here elizabeth shook her head over this letter it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sisters being in town four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expense when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the meantime when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity though i cannot help blaming her she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it i need not explain myself farther and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy i cannot understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty we had better not mention it i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford pray go to see them with sir william and maria i am sure you will be very comfortable there yours etc this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in this case than in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went oni am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_ they are even impartial towards miss king i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain illustration on the stairs chapter xxvii illustration with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away march was to take elizabeth to hunsford she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr collins there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay everything however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became as perfect as plan could be the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable sir william lucas and his daughter maria a goodhumoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too long he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon as they drove to mr gardiners door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower all was joy and kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute inquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune nowhy should he if it were not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe if _she_ does not object to it why should _we_ _her_ not objecting does not justify _him_ it only shows her being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling well cried elizabeth have it as you choose _he_ shall be mercenary and _she_ shall be foolish no lizzy that is what i do _not_ choose i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs gardiner but perhaps to the lakes no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen what are men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we _do_ return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anything we _will_ know where we have gonewe _will_ recollect what we have seen lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers illustration at the door chapter xxviii illustration every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants at length the parsonage was discernible the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge everything declared they were arriving mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when mr collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not seldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbands help it was rather small but well built and convenient and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us i _should_ say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenour of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings a lively imagination soon settled it all about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her she opened the door and met maria in the landingplace who breathless with agitation cried out illustration in conversation with the ladies copyright by george allen oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the diningroom for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make haste and come down this moment elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate and is this all cried elizabeth i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought she could be so thin and small she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind why does she not come in oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas she looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will make him a very proper wife mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day illustration lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure _copyright by george allen_ chapter xxix illustration mr collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere is no occasion for anything more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st jamess as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm elizabeths courage did not fail her she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation from the entrance hall of which mr collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs jenkinson were sitting her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary in spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them the party did not supply much conversation elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted she inquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly lady catherine then observed your fathers estate is entailed on mr collins i think for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourghs family do you play and sing miss bennet a little oh thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing one of them does why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours do you draw no not at all what none of you not one that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters my mother would have no objection but my father hates london has your governess left you we never had any governess no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your education elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must have been neglected compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be idle certainly might ay no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfes calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet yes maam all all what all five out at once very odd and you only the second the younger ones out before the elder are married your younger sisters must be very young yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company but really maam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on _such_ a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence you cannot be more than twenty i am suretherefore you need not conceal your age i am not oneandtwenty when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party their table was superlatively stupid scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light a great deal more passed at the other table lady catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself mr collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologizing if he thought he won too many sir william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broken up the carriage was offered to mrs collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands illustration chapter xxx illustration sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road the room in which the ladies sat was backwards elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collinss joints of meat were too large for her family elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty illustration he never failed to inform them the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one cardtable in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have illustration the gentlemen accompanied him _copyright by george allen_ the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him charlotte had seen them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure elizabeth merely courtesied to him without saying a word colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins sat for some time without speaking to anybody at length however his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the health of her family she answered him in the usual way and after a moments pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months have you never happened to see her there she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet the subject was pursued no further and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away illustration at church chapter xxxi illustration colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easterday almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had only seen at church the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawingroom her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darcy _his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talking of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is we were talking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed delightfully how does georgiana get on darcy mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrs jenkinsons room she would be in nobodys way you know in that part of the house mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts illbreeding and made no answer when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument he drew a chair near her lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me leave to say very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear i am not afraid of you said he smilingly pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam i should like to know how he behaves among strangers you shall hear thenbut prepare for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a balland at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am illqualified to recommend myself to strangers shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is illqualified to recommend himself to strangers i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right you have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting we neither of us perform to strangers here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ had she been his relation lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home illustration chapter xxxii illustration elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr darcy only entered the room he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologized for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within they then sat down and when her inquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergency recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london perfectly so i thank you she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understandingthough i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a days journey yes i call it a very easy distance i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match cried elizabeth i should never have said mrs collins was settled _near_ her family it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expense of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case _here_ mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said _you_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment _you_ cannot have been always at longbourn elizabeth looked surprised the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk the _têteàtête_ surprised them mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody went away illustration accompanied by their aunt _copyright by george allen_ what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was gone my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probable from the time of year all field sports were over within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners she believed he might have the best informed mind but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom appeared really animated mrs collins knew not what to make of him colonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself seriously to work to find it out she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all illustration on looking up chapter xxxiii illustration more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr darcy she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd yet it did and even the third it seemed like wilful illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too his words seemed to imply it could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts she supposed if he meant anything he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage she was engaged one day as she walked in reperusing janes last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intended to close it with a call at the parsonage are you going much farther no i should have turned in a moment and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she yesif darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he arranges the business just as he pleases and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and dependence in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons cannot marry where they like unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do our habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earls younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy are you indeed and pray what sort of a guardian do you make does your charge give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth she directly replied you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe is a great friend of darcys oh yes said elizabeth drilymr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him care of him yes i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture what is it you mean it is a circumstance which darcy of course could not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing you may depend upon my not mentioning it and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady and what arts did he use to separate them he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling he only told me what i have now told you elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge you are rather disposed to call his interference officious i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected there could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them if his own vanity however did not mislead him _he_ was the causehis pride and caprice were the causeof all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliams words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objectionall loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating neither could anything be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea mrs collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather displeased by her staying at home illustration chapter xxxiv illustration when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever clouded elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal mr darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the doorbell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to inquire particularly after her but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the room in a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but said not a word after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloured doubted and was silent this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could _feel_ gratitude i would now thank you but i cannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation mr darcy who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it the pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little _endeavour_ at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance i might as well inquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i _was_ uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_ you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity can you deny that you have done it she repeated with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards _him_ i have been kinder than towards myself elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuouslyyes his misfortunes have been great indeed and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy you have reduced him to his present state of povertycomparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by everything but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connectionsto congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification she went on from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house the tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy that he should have been in love with her for so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room illustration hearing herself called chapter xxxv illustration elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anything else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcys sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr darcy she was directly retreating but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the gate he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand the envelope itself was likewise full pursuing her way along the lane she then began it it was dated from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sisterand the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry the necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i also watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment if _you_ have not been mistaken here _i_ must have been in an error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your fatherpardon meit pains me to offend you but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning the part which i acted is now to be explained his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london we accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice i described and enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done thus much there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn themwith respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character it adds even another motive my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in questionof which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped how he lived i know not but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt and how i acted regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge mr wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement his revenge would have been complete indeed this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed for the truth of everything here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning i will only add god bless you fitzwilliam darcy illustration chapter xxxvi illustration elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty it was all pride and insolence but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickhamwhen she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himselfher feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehoodand when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err but when she read and reread with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success on both sides it was only assertion again she read on but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told illustration meeting accidentally in town _copyright by george allen_ himself as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of inquiring his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance but no such recollection befriended her she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read but alas the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr philipss many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcythat mr darcy might leave the country but that _he_ should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at anything his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in further justification of mr darcy she could not but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affairthat proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintancean acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his waysseen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustanything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habitsthat among his own connections he was esteemed and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feelingthat had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible she grew absolutely ashamed of herself of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd how despicably have i acted she cried i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned till this moment i never knew myself from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcys explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widely different was the effect of a second perusal how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment and she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane she felt that janes feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in tones of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus selfattracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought reconsidering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object she could think only of her letter illustration his parting obeisance chapter xxxvii illustration the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyships indignation would have been what would she have said how would she have behaved were the questions with which she amused herself their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutelymore i think than last year his attachment to rosings certainly increases mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your company i am sure i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next saturday why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expected you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came there can be no occasion for your going so soon mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight but my father cannot he wrote last week to hurry my return illustration dawson _copyright by george allen_ oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters are never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stay another _month_ complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouchebox there will be very good room for one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan lady catherine seemed resigned mrs collins you must send a servant with them you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves it is highly improper you must contrive to send somebody i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two menservants go with her miss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john with the young ladies mrs collins i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone my uncle is to send a servant for us oh your uncle he keeps a manservant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessarywhich elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections mr darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin they were hopeless of remedy her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what chance could there be of improvement catherine weakspirited irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless would scarcely give them a hearing they were ignorant idle and vain while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family when to these recollections was added the development of wickhams character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out her hand to both illustration the elevation of his feelings chapter xxxviii illustration on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attention she had received must make _her_ feel the obliged mr collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady catherines great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprang poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr and mrs gardiner though unknown he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings illustration they had forgotten to leave any message but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off good gracious cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardiners house where they were to remain a few days jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister further illustration how nicely we are crammed in chapter xxxix illustration it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom upstairs these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a salad and cucumber after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there then showing her purchaseslook here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight are they indeed cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have yes thought elizabeth _that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to table what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay lydia laughed and said ay that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary kingtheres for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safe and mary king is safe added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune she is a great fool for going away if she liked him but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane i am sure there is not on _his_ i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys and lydias purchases were seated in it how nicely we are crammed in cried lydia i am glad i brought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare she is almost threeandtwenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before threeandtwenty my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you cant think she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it lord how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would _chaperon_ you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening bythebye mrs forster and me are _such_ friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a ladyonly think what fun not a soul knew of it but colonel and mrs forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs forster i thought i should have died and _that_ made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name their reception at home was most kind mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was inquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other persons was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that anybody might have heard us ten miles off to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for _me_ i should infinitely prefer a book but of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how everybody went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers there was another reason too for her opposition she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible the comfort to _her_ of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last illustration chapter xl illustration elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him blame you oh no but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham noi do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did but you _will_ know it when i have told you what happened the very next day she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham what a stroke was this for poor jane who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual nor was darcys vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both of them good for anything take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr darcys but you shall do as you choose it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane i do not know when i have been more shocked said she wickham so very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it so oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason it is such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually abusive without saying anything just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very uncomfortablei may say unhappy and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickhams character miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your own opinion that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is some time hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to reestablish a character we must not make him desperate the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbade the disclosure she dared not relate the other half of mr darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits jane was not happy she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of janes for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody i told my sister philips so the other day but i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london well he is a very undeserving young manand i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have inquired of everybody too who is likely to know illustration i am determined never to speak of it again i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping i dare say no nothing at all a great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes _they_ will take care not to outrun their income _they_ will never be distressed for money well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens it was a subject which they could not mention before me no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better _i_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me illustration when colonel millers regiment went away _copyright by george allen_ chapter xli illustration the first week of their return was soon gone the second began it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace the dejection was almost universal the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hardheartedness in any of the family good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe how can you be smiling so lizzy their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion fiveandtwenty years ago i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millers regiment went away i thought i should have broke my heart i am sure i shall break _mine_ said lydia if one could but go to brighton observed mrs bennet oh yesif one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable a little seabathing would set me up for ever and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good added kitty such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame she felt anew the justice of mr darcys objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married a resemblance in goodhumour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their _three_ months acquaintance they had been intimate _two_ the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy calling for everyones congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia said she though i am _not_ her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the deathwarrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair already arisen repeated mr bennet what has she frightened away some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character excuse mefor i must speak plainly if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculousa flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty is also comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple ofor i may say threevery silly sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathingplace covered with officers she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once illustration tenderly flirting _copyright by george allen_ had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving home elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal on the very last day of the regiments remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in goodhumour that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man asked her how she had liked him her answer was warmly in his favour with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say that he was at rosings nearly three weeks and you saw him frequently yes almost every day his manners are very different from his cousins yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance indeed cried wickham with a look which did not escape her and pray may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials oh no said elizabeth in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possibleadvice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard illustration the arrival of the gardiners chapter xlii illustration had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of goodhumour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so illjudged a direction of talentstalents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a wateringplace and a camp upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health goodhumour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn everything wore a happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tearsan event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in meryton the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough but it was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me the period of expectation was now doubled four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival but they did pass away and mr and mrs gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every wayteaching them playing with them and loving them the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement one enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither layoxford blenheim warwick kenilworth birmingham etc are sufficiently known a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardiners former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it in talking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again mr gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much said her aunt a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected wickham passed all his youth there you know elizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains mrs gardiner abused her stupidity if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the country elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce the possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private inquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme to pemberley therefore they were to go illustration conjecturing as to the date chapter xliii illustration elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter the park was very large and contained great variety of ground they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of the valley into which the road with some abruptness wound it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned elizabeth was delighted she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her they followed her into the diningparlour it was a large wellproportioned room handsomely fitted up elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly finewith less of splendour and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with these rooms i might have now been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something like regret she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with a large party of friends how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day her aunt now called her to look at a picture she approached and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantelpiece her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought up by him at his own expense he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it and that said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my masterand very like him it was drawn at the same time as the otherabout eight years ago i have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not mrs reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master does that young lady know mr darcy elizabeth coloured and said a little and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam yes very handsome i am sure _i_ know none so handsome but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then he was very fond of them this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickhams being among them mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mr gardiner oh yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long in the next room is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master she comes here tomorrow with him mr gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate if your master would marry you might see more of him yes sir but i do not know when _that_ will be i do not know who is good enough for him mr and mrs gardiner smiled elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so i say no more than the truth and what everybody will say that knows him replied the other elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a master yes sir i know i am if i were to go through the world i could not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generoushearted boy in the world elizabeth almost stared at her can this be mr darcy thought she his father was an excellent man said mrs gardiner yes maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like himjust as affable to the poor elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point she related the subjects of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw anything of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend perhaps we might be deceived that is not very likely our authority was too good on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter the room and this is always the way with him she added whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for her the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were all that remained to be shown in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her at last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers lifetime there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow how much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and vexation her coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged thing in the world how strange must it appear to him in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come or why did he thus come a day before he was expected had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting and his behaviour so strikingly alteredwhat could it mean that he should even speak to her was amazingbut to speak with such civility to inquire after her family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think or how to account for it they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was not like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy approaching them and at no great distance the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed her colour changed and she said no more mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions that he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardiner elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport mrs gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered from what can it proceed it cannot be for _me_ it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love me after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration it originated in mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together after a short silence the lady first spoke she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till tomorrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling they will join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with youmr bingley and his sisters elizabeth answered only by a slight bow her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingleys name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion _his_ mind was not very differently engaged there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dovedale with great perseverance yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _têteàtête_ was over on mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected he is perfectly wellbehaved polite and unassuming said her uncle there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud _i_ have seen nothing of it i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham he has not an illnatured look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberal master i suppose and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr darcys civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister illustration chapter xliv illustration elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece while these newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was every moment increasing she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and goodhumour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room all elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again he inquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself they had long wished to see him the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough elizabeth on her side had much to do she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased illustration to make herself agreeable to all _copyright by george allen_ in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months we have not met since the th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings their visitors stayed with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how _she_ whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little eager to be alone and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her they saw much to interest but nothing to justify inquiry of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr darcy there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a wellknown fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked it was gratitudegratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberleyfor she had reached it only to a late breakfastought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon illustration engaged by the river chapter xlv illustration convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs annesley a genteel agreeablelooking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrasseda resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over miss darcy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton they must be a great loss to _your_ family in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone while she spoke an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement to no creature had it been revealed where secrecy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behaviour and dress but georgiana would not join her her brothers recommendation was enough to insure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy she cried i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tannedno miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive anything extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield _she_ a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but _that_ was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both the looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of everything but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject illustration chapter xlvi illustration elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves the one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected i am very very sorry so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing our poor mother is sadly grieved my father bears it better how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express though lydias short letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off from b intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackneycoach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road i know not what to think after making every possible inquiry on that side of london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any successno such people had been seen to pass through with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them our distress my dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to everything impossible i grieve to find however that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again tomorrow evening in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be everything in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness oh where where is my uncle cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose good god what is the matter cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his illustration i have not an instant to lose concern and observe her in compassionate silence at length she spoke again i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from anyone my youngest sister has left all her friendshas eloped has thrown herself into the power ofof mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton _you_ know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever darcy was fixed in astonishment when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that _i_ might have prevented it _i_ who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now i am grieved indeed cried darcy grievedshocked but is it certain absolutely certain oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her my father has gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have not the smallest hope it is every way horrible darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew noti was afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake darcy made no answer he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it her power was sinking everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain but self though it would intrude could not engross her lydiathe humiliation the misery she was bringing on them allsoon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to everything else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley today oh yes be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorize her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the least of all her feelings on this development while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible but now it was all too natural for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh how acutely did she now feel it she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit everything relating to their journey was speedily settled they were to be off as soon as possible but what is to be done about pemberley cried mrs gardiner john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for uswas it so yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement _that_ is all settled what is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure an hour however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn illustration the first pleasing earnest of their welcome chapter xlvii illustration i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk do you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncles opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzie so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland oh but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road well thensupposing them to be in londonthey may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no nothis is not likely his most particular friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that _he_ would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greaterwhat shall i call itsusceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating and do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand oh yesthat that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to anyone that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as _this_ should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent fixed there by the keenest of all anguish selfreproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running downstairs from her mothers apartment immediately met her elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives not yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is come i hope everything will be well is my father in town yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word and have you heard from him often we have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention and my motherhow is she how are you all my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressingroom mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well but youhow are you cried elizabeth you look pale how much you must have gone through her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears when they were all in the drawingroom the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and illusage blaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to brighton with all my family _this_ would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear child and now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already _make_ them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am inthat i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at my heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that _one_ only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before one came from her books and the other from her toilette the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lessonthat loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard give me further particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he _was_ coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself yes but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing anything of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from _that_ i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks but not before they went to brighton no i believe not and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself does he know his real character i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened perhaps it would have been better replied her sister but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his wife he brought it with him for us to see jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth these were the contents nind my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am missed i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for laughing pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up goodbye give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey your affectionate friend lydia bennet oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it i never saw anyone so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look well oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she _meant_ well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of ones neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make inquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this illustration the post chapter xlviii illustration the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them upthough as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon there was also a postscript to this effect i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we have nothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every mornings impatience through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parents mind the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your illustration to whom i have related the affair _copyright by george allen_ daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence i am dear sir etc etc mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror a gamester she cried this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit when mrs bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before what is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried sure he will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet came from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from _that_though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression it will pass away soon enough do you suppose them to be in london yes where else can they be so well concealed and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shows some greatness of mind they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers tea this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my nightcap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i canor perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if _i_ should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia _you_ go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne for fifty pounds no kitty i have at least learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry well well said he do not make yourself unhappy if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them illustration chapter xlix illustration two days after mr bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment dont you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech they ran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom from thence to the librarytheir father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said if you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards the little copse upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle yes i have had a letter from him by express well and what news does it bringgood or bad what is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand jane now came up read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about right gracechurch street _monday august _ my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were the particulars i reserve till we meet it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both illustration but perhaps you would like to read it _copyright by george allen_ then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married elizabeth read on i have seen them both they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum these are conditions which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve she comes to us today i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on yours etc edw gardiner is it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished can it be possible that he will marry her wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister my dear father i congratulate you and have you answered the letter said elizabeth no but it must be done soon most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a case let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house andmay i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little and they _must_ marry yet he is _such_ a man yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there are two things that i want very much to knowone is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him money my uncle cried jane what do you mean sir i mean that no man in his proper senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncles doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroom and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves how strange this is and for _this_ we are to be thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds if we are ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor anybody can ever forget it is useless to talk of it it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied just as you please may we take my uncles letter to read to her take whatever you like and get away elizabeth took the letter from his writingtable and they went upstairs together mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one communication would therefore do for all after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hardly contain herself as soon as jane had read mr gardiners hope of lydias being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation to know that her daughter would be married was enough she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct my dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would bei knew he would manage everything how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiners behaviour laid them all under for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents well i am so happy in a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs wickham how well it sounds and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you write for me we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual other schemes too came into her head i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down and order the carriage an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do anything for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding mrs hill began instantly to express her joy elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained illustration the spiteful old ladies _copyright by george allen_ chapter l illustration mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brotherinlaw and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he would this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands lydias expenses had been very little within that sum that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence his letter was soon despatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farmhouse but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such a husband her misery was considered certain it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawingroom were larger but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding into _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage the imprudence of either by receiving them at longbourn a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so much not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal there must be a triumph she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother to mr bennets acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my nieces it is mr wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the promise of an ensigncy in generals regiment now quartered in the north it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her motheryours etc e gardiner mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do but mrs bennet was not so well pleased with it lydias being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody and had so many favourites she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in generals regiment his daughters request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes illustration with an affectionate smile _copyright by george allen_ chapter li illustration their sisters weddingday arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinnertime their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennetsand jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had _she_ been the culprit and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure they came the family were assembled in the breakfastroom to receive them smiles decked the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man _she_ blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a goodhumoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the people hereabouts know i am married today i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like anything elizabeth could bear it no longer she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the diningparlour she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first her ease and good spirits increased she longed to see mrs philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs wickham by each of them and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two housemaids well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfastroom and what do you think of my husband is not he a charming man i am sure my sisters must all envy me i only hope they may have half my good luck they must all go to brighton that is the place to get husbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all go very true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i dont at all like your going such a way off must it be so oh lord yes there is nothing in that i shall like it of all things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all i should like it beyond anything said her mother and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them mr wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydias for him she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion lydia was exceedingly fond of him he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him he did everything best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than anybody else in the country one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you curious to hear how it was managed no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven oclock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if youll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or anything to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well mr darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazement oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret if it was to be a secret said jane say not another word on the subject you may depend upon my seeking no further oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be so angry on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information mr darcy had been at her sisters wedding it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropped if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time pray write instantly and let me understand itunless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance not that i _shall_ though she added to herself and she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of ittill it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante illustration i am sure she did not listen chapter lii illustration elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial right gracechurch street _sept _ my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from _you_ dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor mr darcy called and was shut up with him several hours it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them bothwickham repeatedly lydia once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world his character was to speak for itself he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself if he _had another_ motive i am sure it would never disgrace him he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than _we_ had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings this mrs younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her at length however our kind friend procured the wishedfor direction they were in street he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been _his_ design he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydias flight on her own folly alone he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on mr darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief they met several times for there was much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable everything being settled between _them_ mr darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home but mr gardiner could not be seen and mr darcy found on further inquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business on saturday he came again your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together they met again on sunday and then _i_ saw him too it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn but our visitor was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all he has been accused of many faults at different times but _this_ is the true one nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due but lizzy this must go no further than yourself or jane at most you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ and his commission purchased the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth in _this_ though i doubt whether _his_ reserve or _anybodys_ reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish i believe i have now told you everything it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house _he_ was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she stayed with us if i had not perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her mr darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and _that_ if he marry _prudently_ his wife may teach him i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name but slyness seems the fashion pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing but i must write no more the children have been wanting me this half hour yours very sincerely m gardiner the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters matchwhich she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligationwere proved beyond their greatest extent to be true he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham brotherinlaw of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the connection he had to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return they owed the restoration of lydia her character everything to him oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him for herself she was humbled but she was proud of himproud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again it was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself she was roused from her seat and her reflections by someones approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said he as he joined her you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome i should be sorry indeed if it were _we_ were always good friends and now we are better true are the others coming out i do not know mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley she replied in the affirmative i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of me but of course she did not mention my name to you yes she did and what did she say that you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot turned out well at such a distance as _that_ you know things are strangely misrepresented certainly he replied biting his lips elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other several times i wonder what he can be doing there perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year undoubtedly did you see him while you were at lambton i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had yes he introduced us to his sister and do you like her very much i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad you liked her i hope she will turn out well i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age did you go by the village of kympton i do not recollect that we did i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had a most delightful place excellent parsonagehouse it would have suited me in every respect how should you have liked making sermons exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent i _have_ heard from authority which i thought _as good_ that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron you have yes there was something in _that_ i told you so from the first you may remember i _did_ hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know do not let us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one mind she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house illustration mr darcy with him chapter liii illustration mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again oh lord i dont know not these two or three years perhaps write to me very often my dear as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to _me_ they will have nothing else to do mr wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends one seems so forlorn without them this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister for mrs philips first brought her the news well so much the better not that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what _may_ happen but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so it is quite certain he is coming you may depend on it replied the other for mrs nichols was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certainly true he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed but dont imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i _should_ be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of _myself_ but i dread other peoples remarks elizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation i _will_ leave him to himself in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet you will wait on him of course no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield tis an _etiquette_ i despise said he if he wants our society let him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before _they_ did as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over i wish i could say anything to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much mr bingley arrived mrs bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be senthopeless of seeing him before but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window enter the paddock and ride towards the house her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the windowshe lookedshe saw mr darcy with him and sat down again by her sister there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before mr whats his namethat tall proud man good gracious mr darcyand so it does i vow well any friend of mr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter both sisters were uncomfortable enough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingleys friend without being heard by either of them but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merits she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken but she would not be secure let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on the gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command she had ventured only one glance at darcy he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied darcy after inquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner dida question which she could not answer without confusionsaid scarcely anything he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so could i expect it to be otherwise said she yet why did he come she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak she inquired after his sister but could do no more it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs bennet he readily agreed to it i began to be afraid you would never come back again people _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately george wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or anything it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes how mr darcy looked therefore she could not tell it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very hard to have her taken away from me they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars thank heaven he has _some_ friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present a few weeks he believed when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bennets manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the coveys for you elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago everything she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he found her as handsome as she had been last year as goodnatured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business they then went away mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year illustration jane happened to look round chapter liv illustration as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects which must deaden them more mr darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if he no longer cares for me why silent teasing teasing man i will think no more about him her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh jane take care my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the goodhumour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had revived on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time when they repaired to the diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided he placed himself by her elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of halflaughing alarm his behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them he was on one side of her mother she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawingroom before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend if he does not come to me _then_ said she i shall give him up for ever the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair and on the gentlemens approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shant come and part us i am determined we want none of them do we darcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with her eyes envied everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffeecup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still yes she will remain there till christmas and quite alone have all her friends left her mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whispering to elizabeth again he walked away when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party she now lost every expectation of pleasure they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day i think everything has passed off uncommonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously illustration mrs long and her nieces mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet again elizabeth smiled lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment how hard it is in some cases to be believed and how impossible in others but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge that is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make _me_ your confidante illustration lizzy my dear i want to speak to you chapter lv illustration a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky he should be particularly happy at any time etc etc and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them can you come tomorrow yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed in ran mrs bennet to her daughters room in her dressinggown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is comemr bingley is come he is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss lizzys hair we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went upstairs half an hour ago oh hang kitty what has she to do with it come be quick be quick where is your sash my dear but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went upstairs to her instrument two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma what do you keep winking at me for what am i to do nothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it in a few minutes mrs bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you elizabeth was forced to go we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressingroom elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawingroom mrs bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was everything that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy returned within the stated time seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs bennets invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfastroom for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes but on her returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all _their_ situation was awkward enough but _hers_ she thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world tis too much she added by far too much i do not deserve it oh why is not everybody as happy elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present i must go instantly to my mother she cried i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the cardparty and was sitting upstairs with kitty elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest and most reasonable end in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door with my mother upstairs she will be down in a moment i dare say he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon mrs bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income i hope not so imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _me_ exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen wickham lydia were all forgotten jane was beyond competition her favourite child at that moment she cared for no other her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed it possible i suspected as much replied elizabeth but how did he account for it it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried jane oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune illustration chapter lvi illustration one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the diningroom their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered it was lady catherine de bourgh they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother elizabeth replied very concisely that she was and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters yes madam said mrs bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the ground walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass this must be a most inconvenient sittingroom for the evening in summer the windows are full west mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well yes very well i saw them the night before last elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating anything and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company go my dear cried her mother and show her ladyship about the different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest downstairs as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decentlooking rooms walked on her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waitingwoman was in it they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable illustration after a short survey _copyright by george allen_ how could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked in her face as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment indeed you are mistaken madam i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere _you_ may choose to be you shall not find _me_ so my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that _you_that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephewmy own nephew mr darcy though i _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far what could your ladyship propose by it at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of itif indeed such a report is in existence if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves do you not know that such a report is spread abroad i never heard that it was and can you likewise declare that there is no _foundation_ for it i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship _you_ may ask questions which _i_ shall not choose to answer this is not to be borne miss bennet i insist on being satisfied has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage your ladyship has declared it to be impossible it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason but _your_ arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you may have drawn him in if i have i shall be the last person to confess it miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns but you are not entitled to know _mine_ nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit let me be rightly understood this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is engaged to _my daughter_ now what have you to say only thisthat if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of _his_ mother as well as of hers while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friendsto his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him because honour decorum prudencenay interestforbid it yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all you will be censured slighted and despised by everyone connected with him your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any persons whims i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment _that_ will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on _me_ i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide themthe upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are equal true you _are_ a gentlemans daughter but what was your mother who are your uncles and aunts do not imagine me ignorant of their condition whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to _you_ tell me once for all are you engaged to him though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moments deliberation i am not lady catherine seemed pleased and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement i will make no promise of the kind miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require and i certainly _never_ shall give it i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make _their_ marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no further on the subject not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patchedup business at the expense of your father and uncle and is _such_ a girl to be my nephews sister is _her_ husband who is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother heaven and earthof what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted you can _now_ have nothing further to say she resentfully answered you have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to the house and she rose as she spoke lady catherine rose also and they turned back her ladyship was highly incensed you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody lady catherine i have nothing further to say you know my sentiments you are then resolved to have him i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to _you_ or to any person so wholly unconnected with me it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth has any possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs her mother impatiently met her at the door of her dressingroom to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself she did not choose it said her daughter she would go she is a very finelooking woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible illustration but now it comes out chapter lvii illustration the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley and _her_ being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had looked forward to as possible at some future time in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him in that case he would return no more lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs bennets curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations she followed her father to the fireplace and they both sat down he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents i did not know before that i had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony let me congratulate you on a very important conquest the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins from mr collins and what can _he_ have to say something very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the goodnatured gossiping lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as followshaving thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her eldest sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with everything the heart of mortal can most desiresplendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out my motive for cautioning you is as followswe have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye _mr darcy_ you see is the man now lizzy i think i _have_ surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life it is admirable elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her are you not diverted oh yes pray read on after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned mr collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing _that_ is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation and his expectation of a young olivebranch but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be _missish_ i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn oh cried elizabeth i am exceedingly diverted but it is so strange yes _that_ is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr collinss correspondence for any consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my soninlaw and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report did she call to refuse her consent to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr darcys indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too _little_ she might have fancied too _much_ illustration the efforts of his aunt _copyright by george allen_ chapter lviii illustration instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out it was agreed to mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted you must not blame my aunt lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them if you _will_ thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your _family_ owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of _you_ elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once _my_ affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do had elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who _did_ call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which _she_ had refused to give but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_ after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it darcy mentioned his letter did it said hedid it _soon_ make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents she explained what its effects on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind _your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with _me_ it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was _right_ but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only _child_ i was spoiled by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eightandtwenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased had you then persuaded yourself that i should indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after _that_ evening hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming no indeed i felt nothing but surprise your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due my object _then_ replied darcy was to show you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know anything about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home what could have become of mr bingley and jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made everything easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at and it was rather too early to begin in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house in the hall they parted illustration unable to utter a syllable _copyright by george allen_ chapter lix illustration my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor anything else awakened a suspicion of the truth the evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away at night she opened her heart to jane though suspicion was very far from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here you are joking lizzy this cannot be engaged to mr darcy no no you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged jane looked at her doubtingly oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much you dislike him you know nothing of the matter _that_ is all to be forgot perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself miss bennet still looked all amazement elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried jane my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certainforgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be happy with him there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased jane shall you like to have such a brother very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do anything rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do oh yes you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do when i tell you all what do you mean why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am afraid you will be angry my dearest sister now be _be_ serious i want to talk very seriously let me know everything that i am to know without delay will you tell me how long you have loved him it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley another entreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing further to wish now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself i always had a value for him were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingleys friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know of it to another not to you elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias marriage all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation good gracious cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here i had no notion but he would go ashooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys way elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud mrs bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty kitty owned that she had rather stay at home darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented as she went upstairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then so do not put yourself to inconvenience during their walk it was resolved that mr bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that _she_ his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library she was gone directly her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious lizzy said he what are you doing are you out of your senses to be accepting this man have not you always hated him how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr darcy or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane but will they make you happy have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms lizzy said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything which he condescended to ask i now give it to _you_ if you are resolved on having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage you could scarcely escape discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life you know not what you are about elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with you my lizzy to anyone less worthy to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia he heard her with astonishment this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did everything made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble and economy had it been your uncles doing i must and _would_ have paid him but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way i shall offer to pay him tomorrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr collinss letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure everything was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her and made the important communication its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr darcy who would have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pinmoney what jewels what carriages you will have janes is nothing to itnothing at all i am so pleasedso happy such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my dear lizzy pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before i hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town everything that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me i shall go distracted this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else ten thousand a year and very likely more tis as good as a lord and a special licenceyou must and shall be married by a special licence but my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it tomorrow this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly said he wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well as janes illustration the obsequious civility _copyright by george allen_ chapter lx illustration elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her how could you begin said she i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun my beauty you had early withstood and as for my mannersmy behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence for the liveliness of your mind i did you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for _your_ approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike _them_ had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you know no actual good of mebut nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement but i was embarrassed and so was i you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner a man who had felt less might how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you _would_ have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you _would_ have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect _too much_ i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours my aunts intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know everything lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequences my real purpose was to see _you_ and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister was still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiners long letter but now having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write you supposed more than really existed but _now_ suppose as much as you choose give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes how could i be so silly as to wish it your idea of the ponies is delightful we will go round the park every day i am the happiest creature in the world perhaps other people have said so before but no one with such justice i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh mr darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me you are all to come to pemberley at christmas yours etc mr darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr collins in return for his last dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy console lady catherine as well as you can but if i were you i would stand by the nephew he has more to give yours sincerely etc miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in sending it four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband he bore it however with admirable calmness he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st jamess with very decent composure if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight mrs philipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys goodhumour encouraged yet whenever she _did_ speak she must be vulgar nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley illustration chapter lxi illustration happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper or _her_ affectionate heart the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid from the further disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennets being quite unable to sit alone mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of everything was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy if you love mr darcy half so well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not yours etc as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses she frequently sent them it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley yet for elizabeths sake he assisted him further in his profession lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long that even bingleys goodhumour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropped all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each other even as well as they intended georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end but at length by elizabeths persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them illustration the end chiswick presscharles whittingham and co tooks court chancery lane london

corlears hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you seeposted like silent sentinels all around the town stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries some leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pierheads some looking over the bulwarks of ships from china some high aloft in the rigging as if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are all landsmen of week days pent up in lath and plastertied to counters nailed to benches clinched to desks how then is this are the green fields gone what do they here but look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a dive strange nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses

two handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeks give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it all now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious of my lungs i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it besides passengers get seasickgrow quarrelsomedont sleep of nightsdo not enjoy themselves much as a general thingno i never go as a passenger nor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea as a commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them for my part i abominate all honorable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind whatsoever it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself without taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what not and as for going as cookthough i confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of officer on shipboardyet somehow i never fancied broiling fowlsthough once broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids no when i go to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal masthead true they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough it touches ones sense of honor particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all if just previous to putting your hand into the tarpot you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster making the tallest boys stand in awe of you the transition is a keen one i assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wears off in time what of it if some old hunks of a seacaptain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks what does that indignity amount to weighed i mean in the scales of the new testament do you think the archangel gabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance who aint a slave tell me that well then however the old seacaptains may order me abouthowever they may thump and punch me about i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same wayeither in a physical or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hands should rub each others shoulderblades and be content again i always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves must pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us but _being paid_what will compare with it the urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition finally i always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck for as in this world head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern that is if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the commodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it first but not so in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things at the same time that the leaders little suspect it but wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of the fates who has the constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences me in some unaccountable wayhe can better answer than any one else and doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago it came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this _grand contested election for the presidency of the united states_ whaling voyage by one ishmael bloody battle in affghanistan though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers the fates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short and easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in farcesthough i cannot tell why this was exactly yet now that i recall all the circumstances i think i can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises induced me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with all the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds helped to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such things would not have been inducements but as for me i am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote i love to sail forbidden seas and land on barbarous coasts not ignoring what is good i am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with itwould they let mesince it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in by reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the great floodgates of the wonderworld swung open and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air chapter the carpetbag i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpetbag tucked it under my arm and started for cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city of old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it was a saturday night in december much was i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place would offer till the following monday as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may as well be related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind was made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there was a fine boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket was her great originalthe tyre of this carthagethe place where the first dead american whale was stranded where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen the redmen first sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported cobblestonesso goes the storyto throw at the whales in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit now having a night a day and still another night following before me in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile it was a very dubiouslooking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silverso wherever you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the southwherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire the price and dont be too particular with halting steps i paced the streets and passed the sign of the crossed harpoonsbut it looked too expensive and jolly there further on from the bright red windows of the swordfish inn there came such fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard asphaltic pavementrather weary for me when i struck my foot against the flinty projections because from hard remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within but go on ishmael said i at last dont you hear get away from before the door your patched boots are stopping the way so on i went i now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inns such dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly open it had a careless look as if it were meant for the uses of the public so entering the first thing i did was to stumble over an ashbox in the porch ha thought i ha as the flying particles almost choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city gomorrah but the crossed harpoons and the swordfishthis then must needs be the sign of the trap however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a second interior door it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel of doom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and the preachers text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teethgnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap moving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words underneaththe spouter innpeter coffin coffinspouterrather ominous in that particular connexion thought i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there as the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had a povertystricken sort of creak to it i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffee it was a queer sort of placea gableended old house one side palsied as it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor pauls tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one indoors with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind called euroclydon says an old writerof whose works i possess the only copy extantit maketh a marvellous difference whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both sides and of which the wight death is the only glazier true enough thought i as this passage occurred to my mindold blackletter thou reasonest well yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is the house what a pity they didnt stop up the chinks and the crannies though and thrust in a little lint here and there but its too late to make any improvements now the universe is finished the copestone is on and the chips were carted off a million years ago poor lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings he might plug up both ears with rags and put a corncob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous euroclydon euroclydon says old dives in his red silken wrapperhe had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what a fine frosty night how orion glitters what northern lights let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals but what thinks lazarus can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights would not lazarus rather be in sumatra than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit itself in order to keep out this frost now that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the moluccas yet dives himself he too lives like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of a temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans but no more of this blubbering now we are going awhaling and there is plenty of that yet to come let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet and see what sort of a place this spouter may be chapter the spouterinn entering that gableended spouterinn you found yourself in a wide low straggling entry with oldfashioned wainscots reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new england hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted yet was there a sort of indefinite halfattained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant ever and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you throughits the black sea in a midnight galeits the unnatural combat of the four primal elementsits a blasted heathits a hyperborean winter sceneits the breakingup of the icebound stream of time but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the pictures midst _that_ once found out and all the rest were plain but stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself in fact the artists design seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a capehorner in a great hurricane the halffoundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mastheads the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with knots of human hair and one was sickleshaped with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the newmown grass by a longarmed mower you shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a deathharvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed some were storied weapons with this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoonso like a corkscrew nowwas flung in javan seas and run away with by a whale years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the hump crossing this dusky entry and on through yon lowarched waycut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all roundyou enter the public room a still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old crafts cockpits especially of such a howling night when this corneranchored old ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelflike table covered with cracked glass cases filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide worlds remotest nooks projecting from the further angle of the room stands a darklooking denthe bara rude attempt at a right whales head be that how it may there stands the vast arched bone of the whales jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it within are shabby shelves ranged round with old decanters bottles flasks and in those jaws of swift destruction like another cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him bustles a little withered old man who for their money dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison though true cylinders withoutwithin the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpads goblets fill to _this_ mark and your charge is but a penny to _this_ a penny more and so on to the full glassthe cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about a table examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_ i sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house was fullnot a bed unoccupied but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneers blanket have ye i spose you are goin awhalin so youd better get used to that sort of thing i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent mans blanket i thought so all right take a seat supperyou want supper supperll be ready directly i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the battery at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jackknife stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail but he didnt make much headway i thought at last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room it was cold as icelandno fire at allthe landlord said he couldnt afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candles each in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jackets and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers but the fare was of the most substantial kindnot only meat and potatoes but dumplings good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner my boy said the landlord youll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty landlord i whispered that aint the harpooneer is it oh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumplings he donthe eats nothing but steaks and he likes em rare the devil he does says i where is that harpooneer is he here hell be here afore long was the answer i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark complexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before i did supper over the company went back to the barroom when knowing not what else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on presently a rioting noise was heard without starting up the landlord cried thats the grampuss crew i seed her reported in the offing this morning a three years voyage and a full ship hurrah boys now well have the latest news from the feegees a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough enveloped in their shaggy watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters all bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they seemed an eruption of bears from labrador they had just landed from their boat and this was the first house they entered no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whales mouththe barwhen the wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round one complained of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a pitchlike potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the weather side of an iceisland the liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea and they began capering about most obstreperously i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest this man interested me at once and since the seagods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleepingpartner one so far as this narrative is concerned i will here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six feet in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a cofferdam i have seldom seen such brawn in a man his face was deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy his voice at once announced that he was a southerner and from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea in a few minutes however he was missed by his shipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised a cry of bulkington bulkington wheres bulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of him it was now about nine oclock and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen no man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother i dont know how it is but people like to be private when they are sleeping and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitely multiply nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated the thought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume that being a harpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of the tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over besides it was getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnighthow could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming landlord ive changed my mind about that harpooneeri shant sleep with him ill try the bench here just as you please im sorry i cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and its a plaguy rough board herefeeling of the knots and notches but wait a bit skrimshander ive got a carpenters plane there in the barwait i say and ill make ye snug enough so saying he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning like an ape the shavings flew right and left till at last the planeiron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord was near spraining his wrist and i told him for heavens sake to quitthe bed was soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the shavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a brown study i now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but that could be mended with a chair but it was a foot too narrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed oneso there was no yoking them i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night the devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop couldnt i steal a march on himbolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be wakened by the most violent knockings it seemed no bad idea but upon second thoughts i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next morning so soon as i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be standing in the entry all ready to knock me down still looking round me again and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other persons bed i began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer thinks i ill wait awhile he must be dropping in before long ill have a good look at him then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after alltheres no telling but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer landlord said i what sort of a chap is hedoes he always keep such late hours it was now hard upon twelve oclock the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no he answered generally hes an early birdairley to bed and airley to riseyes hes the bird what catches the worm but tonight he went out a peddling you see and i dont see what on airth keeps him so late unless may be he cant sell his head cant sell his headwhat sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to say landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town thats precisely it said the landlord and i told him he couldnt sell it here the markets overstocked with what shouted i with heads to be sure aint there too many heads in the world i tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly youd better stop spinning that yarn to meim not green may be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i rayther guess youll be done _brown_ if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin his head ill break it for him said i now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlords its broke aready said he broke said i_broke_ do you mean sartain and thats the very reason he cant sell it i guess landlord said i going up to him as cool as mt hecla in a snowstormlandlord stop whittling you and i must understand one another and that too without delay i come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him and in the first place you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and ive no idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir _you_ i mean landlord _you_ sir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution wall said the landlord fetching a long breath thats a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then but be easy be easy this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of has just arrived from the south seas where he bought up a lot of balmed new zealand heads great curios you know and hes sold all on em but one and that one hes trying to sell tonight cause tomorrows sunday and it would not do to be sellin human heads about the streets when folks is goin to churches he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just as he was goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the airth like a string of inions this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling mebut at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man he pays reglar was the rejoinder but come its getting dreadful late you had better be turning flukesits a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced theres plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed its an almighty big bed that why afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm arter that sal said it wouldnt do come along here ill give ye a glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a clock in the corner he exclaimed i vum its sundayyou wont see that harpooneer tonight hes come to anchor somewherecome along then _do_ come _wont_ ye come i considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and i was ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast there said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a washstand and centre table there make yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from eyeing the bed but he had disappeared folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale of things not properly belonging to the room there was a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seamans bag containing the harpooneers wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk likewise there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fireplace and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian moccasin there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat as you see the same in south american ponchos but could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the streets of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and i thought a little damp as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this headpeddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on the bedside i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed as i was and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneers not coming home at all that night it being so very late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care of heaven whether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockery there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door lord save me thinks i that must be the harpooneer the infernal headpeddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical new zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room i was all eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bags mouth this accomplished however he turned roundwhen good heavens what a sight such a face it was of a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares yes its just as i thought hes a terrible bedfellow hes been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be stickingplasters at all those black squares on his cheeks they were stains of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of a white mana whaleman toowho falling among the cannibals had been tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure and what is it thought i after all its only his outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the squares of tattooing to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot suns tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one however i had never been in the south seas and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin now while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some difficulty having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a sealskin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new zealand heada ghastly thing enoughand crammed it down into the bag he now took off his hata new beaver hatwhen i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise there was no hair on his headnone to speak of at leastnothing but a small scalpknot twisted up on his forehead his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull had not the stranger stood between me and the door i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner even as it was i thought something of slipping out of the window but it was the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night in fact i was so afraid of him that i was not game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed his chest and arms as i live these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a thirty years war and just escaped from it with a stickingplaster shirt still more his very legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms it was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south seas and so landed in this christian country i quaked to think of it a peddler of heads tooperhaps the heads of his own brothers he might take a fancy to mineheavens look at that tomahawk but there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back and exactly the colour of a three days old congo baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner but seeing that it was not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage goes up to the empty fireplace and removing the papered fireboard sets up this little hunchbacked image like a tenpin between the andirons the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i thought this fireplace made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease meantimeto see what was next to follow first he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and places them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatches into the fire and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ashes a little he made a polite offer of it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips all these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a singsong or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations and jumping into bed with me i thought it was high time now or never before the light was put out to break the spell in which i had so long been bound but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke the next moment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning whoe debel youhe at last saidyou no speake damme i kille and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark landlord for gods sake peter coffin shouted i landlord watch coffin angels save me speake tellee me whoee be or damme i kille again growled the cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him dont be afraid now said he grinning again queequeg here wouldnt harm a hair of your head stop your grinning shouted i and why didnt you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal i thought ye knowd itdidnt i tell ye he was a peddlin heads around townbut turn flukes again and go to sleep queequeg look hereyou sabbee me i sabbeeyou this man sleepe youyou sabbee me sabbee plentygrunted queequeg puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed you gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a moment for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comely looking cannibal whats all this fuss i have been making about thought i to myselfthe mans a human being just as i am he has just as much reason to fear me as i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian landlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will turn in with him but i dont fancy having a man smoking in bed with me its dangerous besides i aint insured this being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely motioned me to get into bedrolling over to one side as much as to sayi wont touch a leg of ye good night landlord said i you may go i turned in and never slept better in my life chapter the counterpane upon waking next morning about daylight i found queequegs arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost thought i had been his wife the counterpane was of patchwork full of odd little particoloured squares and triangles and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure no two parts of which were of one precise shadeowing i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various timesthis same arm of his i say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt indeed partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke i could hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hues together and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg was hugging me my sensations were strange let me try to explain them when i was a child i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it was a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle the circumstance was this i had been cutting up some caper or otheri think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a little sweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other was all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperlessmy mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed though it was only two oclock in the afternoon of the st june the longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but there was no help for it so up stairs i went to my little room in the third floor undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before i could hope for a resurrection sixteen hours in bed the small of my back ached to think of it and it was so light too the sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coaches in the streets and the sound of gay voices all over the house i felt worse and worseat last i got up dressed and softly going down in my stockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself at her feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time but she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers and back i had to go to my room for several hours i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than i have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly waking from ithalf steeped in dreamsi opened my eyes and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame nothing was to be seen and nothing was to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine my arm hung over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my bedside for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay there frozen with the most awful fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered it all and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i often puzzle myself with it now take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequegs pagan arm thrown round me but at length all the past nights events soberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament for though i tried to move his armunlock his bridegroom claspyet sleeping as he was he still hugged me tightly as though naught but death should part us twain i now strove to rouse himqueequegbut his only answer was a snore i then rolled over my neck feeling as if it were in a horsecollar and suddenly felt a slight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savages side as if it were a hatchetfaced baby a pretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequegin the name of goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiff as a pikestaff looking at me and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature when at last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow and he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon the floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself thinks i queequeg under the circumstances this is a very civilized overture but the truth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this particular compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so much civility and consideration while i was guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motions for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless a man like queequeg you dont see every day he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one by the by and thenstill minus his trowsershe hunted up his boots what under the heavens he did it for i cannot tell but his next movement was to crush himselfboots in hand and hat onunder the bed when from sundry violent gaspings and strainings i inferred he was hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his boots but queequeg do you see was a creature in the transition stageneither caterpillar nor butterfly he was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners his education was not yet completed he was an undergraduate if he had not been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all but then if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on at last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes and began creaking and limping about the room as if not being much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide onesprobably not made to order eitherrather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning seeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that the street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boots on i begged him as well as i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible he complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to my amazement contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest arms and hands he then donned his waistcoat and taking up a piece of hard soap on the washstand centre table dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face i was watching to see where he kept his razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed corner slips out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begins a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheeks thinks i queequeg this is using rogerss best cutlery with a vengeance afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept the rest of his toilet was soon achieved and he proudly marched out of the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his harpoon like a marshals baton chapter breakfast i quickly followed suit and descending into the barroom accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no malice towards him though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the mores the pity so if any one man in his own proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for the barroom was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous and whom i had not as yet had a good look at they were nearly all whalemen chief mates and second mates and third mates and sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and harpooneers and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with bosky beards an unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore this young fellows healthy cheek is like a suntoasted pear in hue and would seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three days landed from his indian voyage that man next him looks a few shades lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached withal _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore but who could show a cheek like queequeg which barred with various tints seemed like the andes western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climates zone by zone grub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went to breakfast they say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease in manner quite selfpossessed in company not always though ledyard the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart of africa which was the sum of poor mungos performancesthis kind of travel i say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table and i was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence and not only that but they looked embarrassed yes here were a set of seadogs many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seasentire strangers to themand duelled them dead without winking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast tableall of the same calling all of kindred tasteslooking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains a curious sight these bashful bears these timid warrior whalemen but as for queequegwhy queequeg sat there among themat the head of the table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle to be sure i cannot say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many heads and grappling the beefsteaks towards him but _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him and every one knows that in most peoples estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly we will not speak of all queequegs peculiarities here how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks done rare enough that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawkpipe and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when i sallied out for a stroll chapter the street if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford in thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts even in broadway and chestnut streets mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies regent street is not unknown to lascars and malays and at bombay in the apollo green live yankees have often scared the natives but new bedford beats all water street and wapping in these lastmentioned haunts you see only sailors but in new bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners savages outright many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh it makes a stranger stare but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians and brighggians and besides the wild specimens of the whalingcraft which unheeded reel about the streets you will see other sights still more curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this town scores of green vermonters and new hampshire men all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery they are mostly young of stalwart frames fellows who have felled forests and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whalelance many are as green as the green mountains whence they came in some things you would think them but a few hours old look there that chap strutting round the corner he wears a beaver hat and swallowtailed coat girdled with a sailorbelt and sheathknife here comes another with a souwester and a bombazine cloak no townbred dandy will compare with a countrybred onei mean a downright bumpkin dandya fellow that in the dogdays will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and joins the great whalefishery you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport in bespeaking his seaoutfit he orders bellbuttons to his waistcoats straps to his canvas trowsers ah poor hayseed how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale when thou art driven straps buttons and all down the throat of the tempest but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers cannibals and bumpkins to show her visitors not at all still new bedford is a queer place had it not been for us whalemen that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of labrador as it is parts of her back country are enough to frighten one they look so bony the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in in all new england it is a land of oil true enough but not like canaan a land also of corn and wine the streets do not run with milk nor in the springtime do they pave them with fresh eggs yet in spite of this nowhere in all america will you find more patricianlike houses parks and gardens more opulent than in new bedford whence came they how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion and your question will be answered yes all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the atlantic pacific and indian oceans one and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea can herr alexander perform a feat like that in new bedford fathers they say give whales for dowers to their daughters and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises apiece you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding for they say they have reservoirs of oil in every house and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles in summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine mapleslong avenues of green and gold and in august high in air the beautiful and bountiful horsechestnuts candelabrawise proffer the passerby their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms so omnipotent is art which in many a district of new bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creations final day and the women of new bedford they bloom like their own red roses but roses only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye cannot save in salem where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore as though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of the puritanic sands chapter the chapel in this same new bedford there stands a whalemans chapel and few are the moody fishermen shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot i am sure that i did not returning from my first morning stroll i again sallied out upon this special errand the sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving sleet and mist wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin i fought my way against the stubborn storm entering i found a small scattered congregation of sailors and sailors wives and widows a muffled silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable the chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets with black borders masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit three of them ran something like the following but i do not pretend to quote sacred to the memory of john talbot who at the age of eighteen was lost overboard near the isle of desolation off patagonia _november_ _st_ this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister sacred to the memory of robert long willis ellery nathan coleman walter canny seth macy and samuel gleig forming one of the boats crews of the ship eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale on the offshore ground in the pacific _december_ _st_ this marble is here placed by their surviving shipmates sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy who in the bows of his boat was killed by a sperm whale on the coast of japan _august_ _d_ this tablet is erected to his memory by his widow shaking off the sleet from my iceglazed hat and jacket i seated myself near the door and turning sideways was surprised to see queequeg near me affected by the solemnity of the scene there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance this savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance because he was the only one who could not read and therefore was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation i knew not but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief that i feel sure that here before me were assembled those in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh oh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among flowers can sayhere _here_ lies my beloved ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these what bitter blanks in those blackbordered marbles which cover no ashes what despair in those immovable inscriptions what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here in what census of living creatures the dead of mankind are included why it is that a universal proverb says of them that they tell no tales though containing more secrets than the goodwin sands how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world we prefix so significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle him if he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth why the life insurance companies pay deathforfeitures upon immortals in what eternal unstirring paralysis and deadly hopeless trance yet lies antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss why all the living so strive to hush all the dead wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city all these things are not without their meanings but faith like a jackal feeds among the tombs and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope it needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of a nantucket voyage i regarded those marble tablets and by the murky light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me yes ishmael the same fate may be thine but somehow i grew merry again delightful inducements to embark fine chance for promotion it seemsaye a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet yes there is death in this business of whalinga speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity but what then methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air methinks my body is but the lees of my better being in fact take my body who will take it i say it is not me and therefore three cheers for nantucket and come a stove boat and stove body when they will for stave my soul jove himself cannot chapter the pulpit i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered immediately as the stormpelted door flew back upon admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain yes it was the famous father mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he was a very great favourite he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry at the time i now write of father mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth for among all the fissures of his wrinkles there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloomthe spring verdure peeping forth even beneath februarys snow no one having previously heard his history could for the first time behold father mapple without the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella and certainly had not come in his carriage for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed however hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit he quietly approached the pulpit like most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and since a regular stairs to such a height would by its long angle with the floor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect it seemed had acted upon the hint of father mapple and finished the pulpit without a stairs substituting a perpendicular side ladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted manropes for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and stained with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance considering what manner of chapel it was seemed by no means in bad taste halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the manropes father mapple cast a look upwards and then with a truly sailorlike but still reverential dexterity hand over hand mounted the steps as if ascending the maintop of his vessel the perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the case with swinging ones were of clothcovered rope only the rounds were of wood so that at every step there was a joint at my first glimpse of the pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary for i was not prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly turn round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder step by step till the whole was deposited within leaving him impregnable in his little quebec i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage no thought i there must be some sober reason for this thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen can it be then that by that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly ties and connexions yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the word to the faithful man of god this pulpit i see is a selfcontaining strongholda lofty ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the walls but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place borrowed from the chaplains former seafarings between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers but high above the flying scud and darkrolling clouds there floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angels face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ships tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into the victorys plank where nelson fell ah noble ship the angel seemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling offserenest azure is at hand nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same seataste that had achieved the ladder and the picture its panelled front was in the likeness of a ships bluff bows and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a ships fiddleheaded beak what could be more full of meaningfor the pulpit is ever this earths foremost part all the rest comes in its rear the pulpit leads the world from thence it is the storm of gods quick wrath is first descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thence it is the god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds yes the worlds a ship on its passage out and not a voyage complete and the pulpit is its prow chapter the sermon father mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense starboard gangway there side away to larboardlarboard gangway to starboard midships midships there was a low rumbling of heavy seaboots among the benches and a still slighter shuffling of womens shoes and all was quiet again and every eye on the preacher he paused a little then kneeling in the pulpits bows folded his large brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea this ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fogin such tones he commenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy the ribs and terrors in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom while all gods sunlit waves rolled by and lift me deepening down to doom i saw the opening maw of hell with endless pains and sorrows there which none but they that feel can tell oh i was plunging to despair in black distress i called my god when i could scarce believe him mine he bowed his ear to my complaints no more the whale did me confine with speed he flew to my relief as on a radiant dolphin borne awful yet bright as lightning shone the face of my deliverer god my song for ever shall record that terrible that joyful hour i give the glory to my god his all the mercy and the power nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon the proper page said beloved shipmates clinch the last verse of the first chapter of jonahand god had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah shipmates this book containing only four chaptersfour yarnsis one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures yet what depths of the soul does jonahs deep sealine sound what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet what a noble thing is that canticle in the fishs belly how billowlike and boisterously grand we feel the floods surging over us we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters seaweed and all the slime of the sea is about us but _what_ is this lesson that the book of jonah teaches shipmates it is a twostranded lesson a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living god as sinful men it is a lesson to us all because it is a story of the sin hardheartedness suddenly awakened fears the swift punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah as with all sinners among men the sin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of godnever mind now what that command was or how conveyedwhich he found a hard command but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us to doremember thatand hence he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade and if we obey god we must disobey ourselves and it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying god consists with this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further flouts at god by seeking to flee from him he thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where god does not reign but only the captains of this earth he skulks about the wharves of joppa and seeks a ship thats bound for tarshish there lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded meaning here by all accounts tarshish could have been no other city than the modern cadiz thats the opinion of learned men and where is cadiz shipmates cadiz is in spain as far by water from joppa as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the atlantic was an almost unknown sea because joppa the modern jaffa shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that just outside the straits of gibraltar see ye not then shipmates that jonah sought to flee worldwide from god miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas so disordered selfcondemning is his look that had there been policemen in those days jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had been arrested ere he touched a deck how plainly hes a fugitive no baggage not a hatbox valise or carpetbagno friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux at last after much dodging search he finds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the strangers evil eye jonah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence in vain essays his wretched smile strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent in their gamesome but still serious way one whispers to the otherjack hes robbed a widow or joe do you mark him hes a bigamist or harry lad i guess hes the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike one of the missing murderers from sodom another runs to read the bill thats stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide and containing a description of his person he reads and looks from jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah prepared to lay their hands upon him frighted jonah trembles and summoning all his boldness to his face only looks so much the more a coward he will not confess himself suspected but that itself is strong suspicion so he makes the best of it and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised they let him pass and he descends into the cabin whos there cries the captain at his busy desk hurriedly making out his papers for the customswhos there oh how that harmless question mangles jonah for the instant he almost turns to flee again but he rallies i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon sail ye sir thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah though the man now stands before him but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance we sail with the next coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing him no sooner sirsoon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger ha jonah thats another stab but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent ill sail with yehe saysthe passage money how much is thatill pay now for it is particularly written shipmates as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history that he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail and taken with the context this is full of meaning now jonahs captain shipmates was one whose discernment detects crime in any but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless in this world shipmates sin that pays its way can travel freely and without a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers so jonahs captain prepares to test the length of jonahs purse ere he judge him openly he charges him thrice the usual sum and its assented to then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions still molest the captain he rings every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger any way he mutters and jonah is put down for his passage point out my stateroom sir says jonah now im travelweary i need sleep thou lookest like it says the captain theres thy room jonah enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no key hearing him foolishly fumbling there the captain laughs lowly to himself and mutters something about the doors of convicts cells being never allowed to be locked within all dressed and dusty as he is jonah throws himself into his berth and finds the little stateroom ceiling almost resting on his forehead the air is close and jonah gasps then in that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ships waterline jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels wards screwed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in jonahs room and the ship heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received the lamp flame and all though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it but made obvious the false lying levels among which it hung the lamp alarms and frightens jonah as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance but that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him the floor the ceiling and the side are all awry oh so my conscience hangs in me he groans straight upwards so it burns but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed still reeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of the roman racehorse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as over the man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and theres naught to staunch it so after sore wrestlings in his berth jonahs prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep and now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening glides to sea that ship my friends was the first of recorded smugglers the contraband was jonah but the sea rebels he will not bear the wicked burden a dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to break but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her when boxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind is shrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over jonahs head in all this raging tumult jonah sleeps his hideous sleep he sees no black sky and raging sea feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sides of the shipa berth in the cabin as i have taken it and was fast asleep but the frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear what meanest thou o sleeper arise startled from his lethargy by that direful cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to the deck grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks wave after wave thus leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat and ever as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul in all his cringing attitudes the godfugitive is now too plainly known the sailors mark him more and more certain grow their suspicions of him and at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to high heaven they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them the lot is jonahs that discovered then how furiously they mob him with their questions what is thine occupation whence comest thou thy country what people but mark now my shipmates the behavior of poor jonah the eager mariners but ask him who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answer to those questions but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him i am a hebrew he criesand theni fear the lord the god of heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land fear him o jonah aye well mightest thou fear the lord god _then_ straightway he now goes on to make a full confession whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicating god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his desertswhen wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest was upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howls louder then with one hand raised invokingly to god with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of jonah and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east and the sea is still as jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smooth water behind he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shootsto all his ivory teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayed unto the lord out of the fishs belly but observe his prayer and learn a weighty lesson for sinful as he is jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment is just he leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards his holy temple and here shipmates is true and faithful repentance not clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing to god was this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale shipmates i do not place jonah before you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a model for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like jonah while he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who when describing jonahs seastorm seemed tossed by a storm himself his deep chest heaved as with a groundswell his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them there now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over the leaves of the book once more and at last standing motionless with closed eyes for the moment seemed communing with god and himself but again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his head lowly with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake these words shipmates god has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press upon me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come down from this masthead and sit on the hatches there where you sit and listen as you listen while some one of you reads _me_ that other and more awful lesson which jonah teaches to _me_ as a pilot of the living god how being an anointed pilotprophet or speaker of true things and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached as we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him along into the midst of the seas where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down and the weeds were wrapped about his head and all the watery world of woe bowled over him yet even then beyond the reach of any plummetout of the belly of hellwhen the whale grounded upon the oceans utmost bones even then god heard the engulphed repenting prophet when he cried then god spake unto the fish and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delights of air and earth and vomited out jonah upon the dry land when the word of the lord came a second time and jonah bruised and beatenhis ears like two seashells still multitudinously murmuring of the oceanjonah did the almightys bidding and what was that shipmates to preach the truth to the face of falsehood that was it this shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of the living god who slights it woe to him whom this world charms from gospel duty woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god has brewed them into a gale woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness woe to him who in this world courts not dishonor woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were salvation yea woe to him who as the great pilot paul has it while preaching to others is himself a castaway he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasmbut oh shipmates on the starboard hand of every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep is not the maintruck higher than the kelson is low delight is to hima far far upward and inward delightwho against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable self delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him delight is to him who gives no quarter in the truth and kills burns and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of senators and judges delighttopgallant delight is to him who acknowledges no law or lord but the lord his god and is only a patriot to heaven delight is to him whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the ages and eternal delight and deliciousness will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his final breatho fatherchiefly known to me by thy rodmortal or immortal here i die i have striven to be thine more than to be this worlds or mine own yet this is nothing i leave eternity to thee for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his god he said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his face with his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed and he was left alone in the place chapter a bosom friend returning to the spouterinn from the chapel i found queequeg there quite alone he having left the chapel before the benediction some time he was sitting on a bench before the fire with his feet on the stove hearth and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with a jackknife gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth pageas i fanciedstopping a moment looking vacantly around him and giving utterance to a longdrawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number one each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited with much interest i sat watching him savage though he was and hideously marred about the faceat least to my tastehis countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable you cannot hide the soul through all his unearthly tattooings i thought i saw the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils and besides all this there was a certain lofty bearing about the pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor whether it was too that his head being shaved his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief and looked more expansive than it otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one it may seem ridiculous but it reminded me of general washingtons head as seen in the popular busts of him it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows which were likewise very projecting like two long promontories thickly wooded on top queequeg was george washington cannibalistically developed whilst i was thus closely scanning him halfpretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence never troubled himself with so much as a single glance but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning i thought this indifference of his very strange but savages are strange beings at times you do not know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing their calm selfcollectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom i had noticed also that queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the other seamen in the inn he made no advances whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances all this struck me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there was something almost sublime in it here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home by the way of cape horn that iswhich was the only way he could get therethrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to himself surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that but perhaps to be true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher i conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he must have broken his digester as i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that mild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it then only glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements and peering in upon us silent solitary twain the storm booming without in solemn swells i began to be sensible of strange feelings i felt a melting in me no more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world this soothing savage had redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet i began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him and those same things that would have repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus drew me ill try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy i drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs and hints doing my best to talk with him meanwhile at first he little noticed these advances but presently upon my referring to his last nights hospitalities he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows i told him yes whereat i thought he looked pleased perhaps a little complimented we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and producing his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff and then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keeping it regularly passing between us if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagans breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left us cronies he seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his forehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were married meaning in his countrys phrase that we were bosom friends he would gladly die for me if need should be in a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply after supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room together he made me a present of his embalmed head took out his enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out some thirty dollars in silver then spreading them on the table and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one of them towards me and said it was mine i was going to remonstrate but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pockets i let them stay he then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed the paper fireboard by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemed anxious for me to join him but well knowing what was to follow i deliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply or otherwise i was a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible presbyterian church how then could i unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i do you suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and earthpagans and all includedcan possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worshipto do the will of god_that_ is worship and what is the will of godto do to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to me_that_ is the will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish that this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particular presbyterian form of worship consequently i must then unite with him in his ergo i must turn idolator so i kindled the shavings helped prop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences and all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat how it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends man and wife they say there open the very bottom of their souls to each other and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning thus then in our hearts honeymoon lay i and queequega cosy loving pair chapter nightgown we had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals and queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and free and easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulations what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed and we felt like getting up again though daybreak was yet some way down the future yes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up the clothes well tucked around us leaning against the headboard with our four knees drawn up close together and our two noses bending over them as if our kneepans were warmingpans we felt very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors indeed out of bedclothes too seeing that there was no fire in the room the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself if you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more but if like queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich for the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all at once i thought i would open my eyes for when between sheets whether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a way of always keeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences though light be more congenial to our clayey part upon opening my eyes then and coming out of my own pleasant and selfcreated darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelveoclockatnight i experienced a disagreeable revulsion nor did i at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk be it said that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them for now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me even in bed because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlords policy of insurance i was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passed the tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke illuminated by the flame of the newlit lamp whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes i know not but he now spoke of his native island and eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it he gladly complied though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his words yet subsequent disclosures when i had become more familiar with his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give chapter biographical queequeg was a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and south it is not down in any map true places never are when a newhatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a green sapling even then in queequegs ambitious soul lurked a strong desire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two his father was a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors there was excellent blood in his veinsroyal stuff though sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth a sag harbor ship visited his fathers bay and queequeg sought a passage to christian lands but the ship having her full complement of seamen spurned his suit and not all the king his fathers influence could prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in his canoe he paddled off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island on one side was a coral reef on the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with its prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the ship was gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chains and throwing himself at full length upon the deck grappled a ringbolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists queequeg was the son of a king and queequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented and told him he might make himself at home but this fine young savagethis sea prince of wales never saw the captains cabin they put him down among the sailors and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen for at bottomso he told mehe was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were and more than that still better than they were but alas the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be both miserable and wicked infinitely more so than all his fathers heathens arrived at last in old sag harbor and seeing what the sailors did there and then going on to nantucket and seeing how they spent their wages in _that_ place also poor queequeg gave it up for lost thought he its a wicked world in all meridians ill die a pagan and thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christians wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queer ways about him though now some time from home by hints i asked him whether he did not propose going back and having a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he being very old and feeble at the last accounts he answered no not yet and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christians had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him but by and by he said he would returnas soon as he felt himself baptized again for the nonce however he proposed to sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans they had made a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future movements he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon this i told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from he at once resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap with both my hands in his boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds to all this i joyously assented for besides the affection i now felt for queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as such could not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling though well acquainted with the sea as known to merchant seamen his story being ended with his pipes last dying puff queequeg embraced me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the light we rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were sleeping chapter wheelbarrow next morning monday after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber for a block i settled my own and comrades bill using however my comrades money the grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and queequegespecially as peter coffins cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom i now companied with we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my own poor carpetbag and queequegs canvas sack and hammock away we went down to the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf as we were going along the people stared not at queequeg so muchfor they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streetsbut at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms but we heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs i asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons to this in substance he replied that though what i hinted was true enough yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales in short like many inland reapers and mowers who go into the farmers meadows armed with their own scythesthough in no wise obliged to furnish themeven so queequeg for his own private reasons preferred his own harpoon shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it was in sag harbor the owners of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about the thingthough in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrowqueequeg puts his chest upon it lashes it fast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf why said i queequeg you might have known better than that one would think didnt the people laugh upon this he told me another story the people of his island of rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko and its commanderfrom all accounts a very stately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captainthis commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequegs sister a pretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the wedding guests were assembled at the brides bamboo cottage this captain marches in and being assigned the post of honor placed himself over against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty the king queequegs father grace being saidfor those people have their grace as well as wethough queequeg told me that unlike us who at such times look downwards to our platters they on the contrary copying the ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all feastsgrace i say being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates seeing himself placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking himselfbeing captain of a shipas having plain precedence over a mere island king especially in the kings own housethe captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowltaking it i suppose for a huge fingerglass now said queequeg what you tink nowdidnt our people laugh at last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the schooner hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet river on one side new bedford rose in terraces of streets their icecovered trees all glittering in the clear cold air huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the worldwandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch all betokening that new cruises were on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begins a second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for ever and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all earthly effort gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings how i snuffed that tartar airhow i spurned that turnpike earththat common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records at the same foamfountain queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me his dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to the blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan sideways leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes so full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by the plunging bowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers a lubberlike assembly who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro but there were some boobies and bumpkins there who by their intense greenness must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back i thought the bumpkins hour of doom was come dropping his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern in midsomerset the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet while queequeg turning his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff capting capting yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer capting capting heres the devil hallo _you_ sir cried the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking up to queequeg what in thunder do you mean by that dont you know you might have killed that chap what him say said queequeg as he mildly turned to me he say said i that you came near kille that man there pointing to the still shivering greenhorn kille cried queequeg twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain ah him bevy smalle fishe queequeg no kille so smalle fishe queequeg kille big whale look you roared the captain ill kille _you_ you cannibal if you try any more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eye but it so happened just then that it was high time for the captain to mind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the mainsail had parted the weathersheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck the poor fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all hands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness it flew from right to left and back again almost in one ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters nothing was done and nothing seemed capable of being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the midst of this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwarks and then flinging the other like a lasso caught it round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar was that way trapped and all was safe the schooner was run into the wind and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog throwing his long arms straight out before him and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam i looked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved the greenhorn had gone down shooting himself perpendicularly from the water queequeg now took an instants glance around him and seeming to see just how matters were dived down and disappeared a few minutes more and he rose again one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form the boat soon picked them up the poor bumpkin was restored all hands voted queequeg a noble trump the captain begged his pardon from that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle yea till poor queequeg took his last long dive was there ever such unconsciousness he did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies he only asked for waterfresh watersomething to wipe the brine off that done he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the bulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be saying to himselfits a mutual jointstock world in all meridians we cannibals must help these christians chapter nantucket nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a fine run we safely arrived in nantucket nantucket take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of the world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse look at ita mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background there is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there they dont grow naturally that they import canada thistles that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that pieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in rome that people there plant toadstools before their houses to get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass makes an oasis three blades in a days walk a prairie that they wear quicksand shoes something like laplander snowshoes that they are so shut up belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island of by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles but these extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the redmen thus goes the legend in olden times an eagle swooped down upon the new england coast and carried off an infant indian in his talons with loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters they resolved to follow in the same direction setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage they discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casketthe poor little indians skeleton what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should take to the sea for a livelihood they first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand grown bolder they waded out with nets for mackerel more experienced they pushed off in boats and captured cod and at last launching a navy of great ships on the sea explored this watery world put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it peeped in at behrings straits and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan saltsea mastodon clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults and thus have these naked nantucketers these sea hermits issuing from their anthill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery world like so many alexanders parcelling out among them the atlantic pacific and indian oceans as the three pirate powers did poland let america add mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english overswarm all india and hang out their blazing banner from the sun two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketers for the sea is his he owns it as emperors own empires other seamen having but a right of way through it merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but floating forts even pirates and privateers though following the sea as highwaymen the road they but plunder other ships other fragments of the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself the nantucketer he alone resides and riots on the sea he alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation _there_ is his home _there_ lies his business which a noahs flood would not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the millions in china he lives on the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the alps for years he knows not the land so that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales chapter chowder it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor and queequeg and i went ashore so we could attend to no business that day at least none but a supper and a bed the landlord of the spouterinn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all nantucket and moreover he had assured us that cousin hosea as he called him was famous for his chowders in short he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try potluck at the try pots but the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard and that done then ask the first man we met where the place was these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first especially as at the outset queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouseour first point of departuremust be left on the larboard hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to say it was on the starboard however by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we at last came to something which there was no mistaking two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses ears swung from the crosstrees of an old topmast planted in front of an old doorway the horns of the crosstrees were sawed off on the other side so that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallows perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but i could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort of crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns yes _two_ of them one for queequeg and one for me its ominous thinks i a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port tombstones staring at me in the whalemens chapel and here a gallows and a pair of prodigious black pots too are these last throwing out oblique hints touching tophet i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt get along with ye said she to the man or ill be combing ye come on queequeg said i all right theres mrs hussey and so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving mrs hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed mrs hussey postponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a little room and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast turned round to us and saidclam or cod whats that about cods maam said i with much politeness clam or cod she repeated a clam for supper a cold clam is _that_ what you mean mrs hussey says i but thats a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time aint it mrs hussey but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing but the word clam mrs hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappeared queequeg said i do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam however a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us but when that smoking chowder came in the mystery was delightfully explained oh sweet friends hearken to me it was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut up into little flakes the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of mrs husseys clam and cod announcement i thought i would try a little experiment stepping to the kitchen door i uttered the word cod with great emphasis and resumed my seat in a few moments the savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor and in good time a fine codchowder was placed before us we resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks i to myself i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head whats that stultifying saying about chowderheaded people but look queequeg aint that a live eel in your bowl wheres your harpoon fishiest of all fishy places was the try pots which well deserved its name for the pots there were always boiling chowders chowder for breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you began to look for fishbones coming through your clothes the area before the house was paved with clamshells mrs hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey had his account books bound in superior old sharkskin there was a fishy flavor to the milk too which i could not at all account for till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermens boats i saw hoseas brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the sand with each foot in a cods decapitated head looking very slipshod i assure ye supper concluded we received a lamp and directions from mrs hussey concerning the nearest way to bed but as queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers why not said i every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoonbut why not because its dangerous says she ever since young stiggs coming from that unfortnt vyge of his when he was gone four years and a half with only three barrels of _ile_ was found dead in my first floor back with his harpoon in his side ever since then i allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night so mr queequeg for she had learned his name i will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morning but the chowder clam or cod tomorrow for breakfast men both says i and lets have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety chapter the ship in bed we concocted our plans for the morrow but to my surprise and no small concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been diligently consulting yojothe name of his black little godand yojo had told him two or three times over and strongly insisted upon it everyway that instead of our going together among the whalingfleet in harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this i say yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us and in order to do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself i ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as though it had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately ship myself for the present irrespective of queequeg i have forgotten to mention that in many things queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of yojos judgment and surprising forecast of things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs now this plan of queequegs or rather yojos touching the selection of our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a little relied upon queequegs sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely but as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon queequeg i was obliged to acquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our little bedroomfor it seemed that it was some sort of lent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with queequeg and yojo that day _how_ it was i never could find out for though i applied myself to it several times i never could master his liturgies and xxxix articlesleaving queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings i sallied out among the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries i learnt that there were three ships up for threeyears voyagesthe devildam the titbit and the pequod _devildam_ i do not know the origin of _titbit_ is obvious _pequod_ you will no doubt remember was the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct as the ancient medes i peered and pryed about the devildam from her hopped over to the titbit and finally going on board the pequod looked around her for a moment and then decided that this was the very ship for us you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught i knowsquaretoed luggers mountainous japanese junks butterbox galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old pequod she was a ship of the old school rather small if anything with an oldfashioned clawfooted look about her long seasoned and weatherstained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans her old hulls complexion was darkened like a french grenadiers who has alike fought in egypt and siberia her venerable bows looked bearded her mastscut somewhere on the coast of japan where her original ones were lost overboard in a galeher masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrimworshipped flagstone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled but to all these her old antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed old captain peleg many years her chiefmate before he commanded another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the principal owners of the pequodthis old peleg during the term of his chiefmateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched by anything except it be thorkillhakes carved buckler or bedstead she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory she was a thing of trophies a cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies all round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of seaivory scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw a noble craft but somehow a most melancholy all noble things are touched with that now when i looked about the quarterdeck for some one having authority in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage at first i saw nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the mainmast it seemed only a temporary erection used in port it was of a conical shape some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the rightwhale planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the topknot on some old pottowottamie sachems head a triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded a complete view forward and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and the ships work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of command he was seated on an oldfashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed there was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of the elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen and heavily rolled up in blue pilotcloth cut in the quaker style only there was a fine and almost microscopic network of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales and always looking to windwardfor this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together such eyewrinkles are very effectual in a scowl is this the captain of the pequod said i advancing to the door of the tent supposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want of him he demanded i was thinking of shipping thou wast wast thou i see thou art no nantucketerever been in a stove boat no sir i never have dost know nothing at all about whaling i dare sayeh nothing sir but i have no doubt i shall soon learn ive been several voyages in the merchant service and i think that merchant service be damned talk not that lingo to me dost see that legill take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again marchant service indeed i suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships but flukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling ehit looks a little suspicious dont it ehhast not been a pirate hast thoudidst not rob thy last captain didst thoudost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea i protested my innocence of these things i saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes this old seaman as an insulated quakerish nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and rather distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard but what takes thee awhaling i want to know that before i think of shipping ye well sir i want to see what whaling is i want to see the world want to see what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahab who is captain ahab sir aye aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this ship i am mistaken then i thought i was speaking to the captain himself thou art speaking to captain pelegthats who ye are speaking to young man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew we are part owners and agents but as i was going to say if thou wantest to know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out clap eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only one leg what do you mean sir was the other one lost by a whale lost by a whale young man come nearer to me it was devoured chewed up crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boatah ah i was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as i could what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could i know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident look ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft dye see thou dost not talk shark a bit _sure_ yeve been to sea before now sure of that sir said i i thought i told you that i had been four voyages in the merchant hard down out of that mind what i said about the marchant servicedont aggravate mei wont have it but let us understand each other i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel inclined for it i do sir very good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whales throat and then jump after it answer quick i am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to be got rid of that is which i dont take to be the fact good again now then thou not only wantest to go awhaling to find out by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order to see the world was not that what ye said i thought so well then just step forward there and take a peep over the weatherbow and then back to me and tell me what ye see there for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not knowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest but concentrating all his crows feet into one scowl captain peleg started me on the errand going forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the floodtide was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean the prospect was unlimited but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that i could see well whats the report said peleg when i came back what did ye see not much i repliednothing but water considerable horizon though and theres a squall coming up i think well what does thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish to go round cape horn to see any more of it eh cant ye see the world where you stand i was a little staggered but go awhaling i must and i would and the pequod was as good a ship as anyi thought the bestand all this i now repeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness to ship me and thou mayest as well sign the papers right off he addedcome along with ye and so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure it turned out to be captain bildad who along with captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the other shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowd of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards each owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest now bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers was a quaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whalehunters they are fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance so that there are instances among them of men who named with scripture namesa singularly common fashion on the islandand in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character not unworthy a scandinavian seaking or a poetical pagan roman and when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain and a ponderous heart who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long nightwatches in the remotest waters and beneath constellations never seen here at the north been led to think untraditionally and independently receiving all natures sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental advantages to learn a bold and nervous lofty languagethat man makes one in a whole nations censusa mighty pageant creature formed for noble tragedies nor will it at all detract from him dramatically regarded if either by birth or other circumstances he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature for all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness be sure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease but as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from another phase of the quaker modified by individual circumstances like captain peleg captain bildad was a welltodo retired whaleman but unlike captain pelegwho cared not a rush for what are called serious things and indeed deemed those selfsame serious things the veriest of all triflescaptain bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island creatures round the hornall that had not moved this native born quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angle of his vest still for all this immutableness was there some lack of common consistency about worthy captain bildad though refusing from conscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed yet had he in his straightbodied coat spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative evening of his days the pious bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence i do not know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a mans religion is one thing and this practical world quite another this world pays dividends rising from a little cabinboy in short clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broad shadbellied waistcoat from that becoming boatheader chiefmate and captain and finally a ship owner bildad as i hinted before had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his wellearned income now bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks and in his seagoing days a bitter hard taskmaster they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when he sailed the old categut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for a quaker he was certainly rather hardhearted to say the least he never used to swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them when bildad was a chiefmate to have his drabcoloured eye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutch somethinga hammer or a marlingspike and go to work like mad at something or other never mind what indolence and idleness perished before him his own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character on his long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh no superfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it like the worn nap of his broadbrimmed hat such then was the person that i saw seated on the transom when i followed captain peleg down into the cabin the space between the decks was small and there boltupright sat old bildad who always sat so and never leaned and this to save his coat tails his broadbrim was placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume bildad cried captain peleg at it again bildad eh ye have been studying those scriptures now for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge how far ye got bildad as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate bildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked up and seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleg he says hes our man bildad said peleg he wants to ship dost thee said bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me i _dost_ said i unconsciously he was so intense a quaker what do ye think of him bildad said peleg hell do said bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially as peleg his friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i said nothing only looking round me sharply peleg now threw open a chest and drawing forth the ships articles placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table i began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for the voyage i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages but all hands including the captain received certain shares of the profits called _lays_ and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ships company i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my own lay would not be very large but considering that i was used to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the th laythat is the th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually amount to and though the th lay was what they call a rather _long lay_ yet it was better than nothing and if we had a lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it not to speak of my three years beef and board for which i would not have to pay one stiver it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortuneand so it was a very poor way indeed but i am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me while i am putting up at this grim sign of the thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had i been offered the th considering i was of a broadshouldered make but one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this ashore i had heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners left nearly the whole management of the ships affairs to these two and i did not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands especially as i now found him on board the pequod quite at home there in the cabin and reading his bible as if at his own fireside now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jackknife old bildad to my no small surprise considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings bildad never heeded us but went on mumbling to himself out of his book _lay_ not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth well captain bildad interrupted peleg what dye say what lay shall we give this young man thou knowest best was the sepulchral reply the seven hundred and seventyseventh wouldnt be too much would itwhere moth and rust do corrupt but _lay_ _lay_ indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred and seventyseventh well old bildad you are determined that i for one shall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below where moth and rust do corrupt it was an exceedingly _long lay_ that indeed and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventyseven is a pretty large number yet when you come to make a _teenth_ of it you will then see i say that the seven hundred and seventyseventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventyseven gold doubloons and so i thought at the time why blast your eyes bildad cried peleg thou dost not want to swindle this young man he must have more than that seven hundred and seventyseventh again said bildad without lifting his eyes and then went on mumblingfor where your treasure is there will your heart be also i am going to put him down for the three hundredth said peleg do ye hear that bildad the three hundredth lay i say bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this shipwidows and orphans many of themand that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans the seven hundred and seventyseventh lay captain peleg thou bildad roared peleg starting up and clattering about the cabin blast ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these matters i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn captain peleg said bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water or ten fathoms i cant tell but as thou art still an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit captain peleg fiery pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye insult me its an allfired outrage to tell any human creature that hes bound to hell flukes and flames bildad say that again to me and start my soulbolts but illillyes ill swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on out of the cabin ye canting drabcoloured son of a wooden guna straight wake with ye as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad but with a marvellous oblique sliding celerity bildad for that time eluded him alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad who i made no doubt was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg but to my astonishment he sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways as for peleg after letting off his rage as he had there seemed no more left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated whew he whistled at lastthe squalls gone off to leeward i think bildad thou used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jackknife here needs the grindstone thats he thank ye bildad now then my young man ishmaels thy name didnt ye say well then down ye go here ishmael for the three hundredth lay captain peleg said i i have a friend with me who wants to ship tooshall i bring him down tomorrow to be sure said peleg fetch him along and well look at him what lay does he want groaned bildad glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself oh never thee mind about that bildad said peleg has he ever whaled it any turning to me killed more whales than i can count captain peleg well bring him along then and after signing the papers off i went nothing doubting but that i had done a good mornings work and that the pequod was the identical ship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape but i had not proceeded far when i began to bethink me that the captain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me though indeed in many cases a whaleship will be completely fitted out and receive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have a family or any absorbing concernment of that sort he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea however it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands turning back i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain ahab was to be found and what dost thou want of captain ahab its all right enough thou art shipped yes but i should like to see him but i dont think thou wilt be able to at present i dont know exactly whats the matter with him but he keeps close inside the house a sort of sick and yet he dont look so in fact he aint sick but no he isnt well either any how young man he wont always see me so i dont suppose he will thee hes a queer man captain ahabso some thinkbut a good one oh thoult like him well enough no fear no fear hes a grand ungodly godlike man captain ahab doesnt speak much but when he does speak then you may well listen mark ye be forewarned ahabs above the common ahabs been in colleges as well as mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales his lance aye the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle oh he aint captain bildad no and he aint captain peleg _hes ahab_ boy and ahab of old thou knowest was a crowned king and a very vile one when that wicked king was slain the dogs did they not lick his blood come hither to mehither hither said peleg with a significance in his eye that almost startled me look ye lad never say that on board the pequod never say it anywhere captain ahab did not name himself twas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who died when he was only a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig at gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic and perhaps other fools like her may tell thee the same i wish to warn thee its a lie i know captain ahab well ive sailed with him as mate years ago i know what he isa good mannot a pious good man like bildad but a swearing good mansomething like meonly theres a good deal more of him aye aye i know that he was never very jolly and i know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about as any one might see i know too that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale hes been a kind of moodydesperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pass off and once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young man its better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one so goodbye to theeand wrong not captain ahab because he happens to have a wicked name besides my boy he has a wifenot three voyages weddeda sweet resigned girl think of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in ahab no no my lad stricken blasted if he be ahab has his humanities as i walked away i was full of thoughtfulness what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him and somehow at the time i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i dont know what unless it was the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strange awe of him but that sort of awe which i cannot at all describe was not exactly awe i do not know what it was but i felt it and it did not disincline me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him so imperfectly as he was known to me then however my thoughts were at length carried in other directions so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind chapter the ramadan as queequegs ramadan or fasting and humiliation was to continue all day i did not choose to disturb him till towards nightfall for i cherish the greatest respect towards everybodys religious obligations never mind how comical and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toadstool or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name i say we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these things and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals pagans and what not because of their halfcrazy conceits on these subjects there was queequeg now certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about yojo and his ramadanbut what of that queequeg thought he knew what he was about i suppose he seemed to be content and there let him rest all our arguing with him would not avail let him be i say and heaven have mercy on us allpresbyterians and pagans alikefor we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need mending towards evening when i felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over i went up to his room and knocked at the door but no answer i tried to open it but it was fastened inside queequeg said i softly through the keyholeall silent i say queequeg why dont you speak its iishmael but all remained still as before i began to grow alarmed i had allowed him such abundant time i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit i looked through the keyhole but the door opening into an odd corner of the room the keyhole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one i could only see part of the footboard of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing more i was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of queequegs harpoon which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him before our mounting to the chamber thats strange thought i but at any rate since the harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or never goes abroad without it therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistake queequegqueequegall still something must have happened apoplexy i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted running down stairs i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person i metthe chambermaid la la she cried i thought something must be the matter i went to make the bed after breakfast and the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard and its been just so silent ever since but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping la la maammistress murder mrs hussey apoplexyand with these cries she ran towards the kitchen i following mrs hussey soon appeared with a mustardpot in one hand and a vinegarcruet in the other having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors and scolding her little black boy meantime woodhouse cried i which way to it run for gods sake and fetch something to pry open the doorthe axethe axe hes had a stroke depend upon itand so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairs again emptyhanded when mrs hussey interposed the mustardpot and vinegarcruet and the entire castor of her countenance whats the matter with you young man get the axe for gods sake run for the doctor some one while i pry it open look here said the landlady quickly putting down the vinegarcruet so as to have one hand free look here are you talking about prying open any of my doorsand with that she seized my arm whats the matter with you whats the matter with you shipmate in as calm but rapid a manner as possible i gave her to understand the whole case unconsciously clapping the vinegarcruet to one side of her nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimedno i havent seen it since i put it there running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs she glanced in and returning told me that queequegs harpoon was missing hes killed himself she cried its unfortnate stiggs done over againthere goes another counterpanegod pity his poor motherit will be the ruin of my house has the poor lad a sister wheres that girlthere betty go to snarles the painter and tell him to paint me a sign withno suicides permitted here and no smoking in the parlormight as well kill both birds at once kill the lord be merciful to his ghost whats that noise there you young man avast there and running up after me she caught me as i was again trying to force open the door i dont allow it i wont have my premises spoiled go for the locksmith theres one about a mile from here but avast putting her hand in her sidepocket heres a key thatll fit i guess lets see and with that she turned it in the lock but alas queequegs supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within have to burst it open said i and was running down the entry a little for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing i should not break down her premises but i tore from her and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark with a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slamming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there good heavens there sat queequeg altogether cool and selfcollected right in the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding yojo on top of his head he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life queequeg said i going up to him queequeg whats the matter with you he haint been a sittin so all day has he said the landlady but all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt like pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almost intolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained especially as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours going too without his regular meals mrs hussey said i hes _alive_ at all events so leave us if you please and i will see to this strange affair myself closing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to prevail upon queequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all he could dofor all my polite arts and blandishmentshe would not move a peg nor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in the slightest way i wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan do they fast on their hams that way in his native island it must be so yes its part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest hell get up sooner or later no doubt it cant last for ever thank god and his ramadan only comes once a year and i dont believe its very punctual then i went down to supper after sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plumpudding voyage as they called it that is a short whalingvoyage in a schooner or brig confined to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean only after listening to these plumpuddingers till nearly eleven oclock i went up stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time queequeg must certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination but no there he was just where i had left him he had not stirred an inch i began to grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room holding a piece of wood on his head for heavens sake queequeg get up and shake yourself get up and have some supper youll starve youll kill yourself queequeg but not a word did he reply despairing of him therefore i determined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt before a great while he would follow me but previous to turning in i took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on for some time do all i would i could not get into the faintest doze i had blown out the candle and the mere thought of queequegnot four feet offsitting there in that uneasy position stark alone in the cold and dark this made me really wretched think of it sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary unaccountable ramadan but somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more till break of day when looking over the bedside there squatted queequeg as if he had been screwed down to the floor but as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints but with a cheerful look limped towards me where i lay pressed his forehead again against mine and said his ramadan was over now as i before hinted i have no objection to any persons religion be it what it may so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person because that other person dont believe it also but when a mans religion becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment to him and in fine makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in then i think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him and just so i now did with queequeg queequeg said i get into bed now and lie and listen to me i then went on beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions and coming down to the various religions of the present time during which time i labored to show queequeg that all these lents ramadans and prolonged hamsquattings in cold cheerless rooms were stark nonsense bad for the health useless for the soul opposed in short to the obvious laws of hygiene and common sense i told him too that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badly pained me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan of his besides argued i fasting makes the body cave in hence the spirit caves in and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be halfstarved this is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters in one word queequeg said i rather digressively hell is an idea first born on an undigested appledumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it in he said no only upon one memorable occasion it was after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two oclock in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening no more queequeg said i shuddering that will do for i knew the inferences without his further hinting them i had seen a sailor who had visited that very island and he told me that it was the custom when a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they were placed in great wooden trenchers and garnished round like a pilau with breadfruit and cocoanuts and with some parsley in their mouths were sent round with the victors compliments to all his friends just as though these presents were so many christmas turkeys after all i do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon queequeg because in the first place he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless considered from his own point of view and in the second place he did not more than one third understand me couch my ideas simply as i would and finally he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than i did he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety at last we rose and dressed and queequeg taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board the pequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut bones chapter his mark as we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg carrying his harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft unless they previously produced their papers what do you mean by that captain peleg said i now jumping on the bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf i mean he replied he must show his papers yes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from behind pelegs out of the wigwam he must show that hes converted son of darkness he added turning to queequeg art thou at present in communion with any christian church why said i hes a member of the first congregational church here be it said that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches first congregational church cried bildad what that worships in deacon deuteronomy colemans meetinghouse and so saying taking out his spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the wigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks took a good long look at queequeg how long hath he been a member he then said turning to me not very long i rather guess young man no said peleg and he hasnt been baptized right either or it would have washed some of that devils blue off his face do tell now cried bildad is this philistine a regular member of deacon deuteronomys meeting i never saw him going there and i pass it every lords day i dont know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting said i all i know is that queequeg here is a born member of the first congregational church he is a deacon himself queequeg is young man said bildad sternly thou art skylarking with meexplain thyself thou young hittite what church dost thee mean answer me finding myself thus hard pushed i replied i mean sir the same ancient catholic church to which you and i and captain peleg there and queequeg here and all of us and every mothers son and soul of us belong the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in _that_ we all join hands splice thou meanst _splice_ hands cried peleg drawing nearer young man youd better ship for a missionary instead of a foremast hand i never heard a better sermon deacon deuteronomywhy father mapple himself couldnt beat it and hes reckoned something come aboard come aboard never mind about the papers i say tell quohog therewhats that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great anchor what a harpoon hes got there looks like good stuff that and he handles it about right i say quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the head of a whaleboat did you ever strike a fish without saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whaleboats hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way as this capain you see him small drop tar on water dere you see him well spose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over old bildads broad brim clean across the ships decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight now said queequeg quietly hauling in the line sposee him whalee eye why dad whale dead quick bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway quick i say you bildad and get the ships papers we must have hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boats look ye quohog well give ye the ninetieth lay and thats more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of nantucket so down we went into the cabin and to my great joy queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ships company to which i myself belonged when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for signing he turned to me and said i guess quohog there dont know how to write does he i say quohog blast ye dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark but at this question queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies looked no ways abashed but taking the offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm so that through captain pelegs obstinate mistake touching his appellative it stood something like this quohog his x mark meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broadskirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts and selecting one entitled the latter day coming or no time to lose placed it in queequegs hands and then grasping them and the book with both his looked earnestly into his eyes and said son of darkness i must do my duty by thee i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways which i sadly fear i beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman spurn the idol bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye i say oh goodness gracious steer clear of the fiery pit something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildads language heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases avast there avast there bildad avast now spoiling our harpooneer cried peleg pious harpooneers never make good voyagersit takes the shark out of em no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish there was young nat swaine once the bravest boatheader out of all nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting and never came to good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of afterclaps in case he got stove and went to davy jones peleg peleg said bildad lifting his eyes and hands thou thyself as i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what it is to have the fear of death how then canst thou prate in this ungodly guise thou beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on japan that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab didst thou not think of death and the judgment then hear him hear him now cried peleg marching across the cabin and thrusting his hands far down into his pocketshear him all of ye think of that when every moment we thought the ship would sink death and the judgment then what with all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breaking over us fore and aft think of death and the judgment then no no time to think about death then life was what captain ahab and i was thinking of and how to save all handshow to rig jurymastshow to get into the nearest port that was what i was thinking of bildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck where we followed him there he stood very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a topsail in the waist now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted chapter the prophet shipmates have ye shipped in that ship queequeg and i had just left the pequod and were sauntering away from the water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when the above words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before us levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question he was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck a confluent smallpox had in all directions flowed over his face and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters have been dried up have ye shipped in her he repeated you mean the ship pequod i suppose said i trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him aye the pequodthat ship there he said drawing back his whole arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object yes said i we have just signed the articles anything down there about your souls about what oh perhaps you havnt got any he said quickly no matter though i know many chaps that havnt got anygood luck to em and they are all the better off for it a souls a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon what are you jabbering about shipmate said i _hes_ got enough though to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps abruptly said the stranger placing a nervous emphasis upon the word _he_ queequeg said i lets go this fellow has broken loose from somewhere hes talking about something and somebody we dont know stop cried the stranger ye said trueye havnt seen old thunder yet have ye whos old thunder said i again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner captain ahab what the captain of our ship the pequod aye among some of us old sailor chaps he goes by that name ye havnt seen him yet have ye no we havnt hes sick they say but is getting better and will be all right again before long all right again before long laughed the stranger with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh look ye when captain ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right not before what do you know about him what did they _tell_ you about him say that they didnt tell much of anything about him only ive heard that hes a good whalehunter and a good captain to his crew thats true thats trueyes both true enough but you must jump when he gives an order step and growl growl and gothats the word with captain ahab but nothing about that thing that happened to him off cape horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altar in santaheard nothing about that eh nothing about the silver calabash he spat into and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage according to the prophecy didnt ye hear a word about them matters and something more eh no i dont think ye did how could ye who knows it not all nantucket i guess but howsever mayhap yeve heard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that i dare say oh yes _that_ every one knows amosti mean they know hes only one leg and that a parmacetti took the other off my friend said i what all this gibberish of yours is about i dont know and i dont much care for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head but if you are speaking of captain ahab of that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i know all about the loss of his leg _all_ about it ehsure you doall pretty sure with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the beggarlike stranger stood a moment as if in a troubled reverie then starting a little turned and saidyeve shipped have ye names down on the papers well well whats signed is signed and whats to be will be and then again perhaps it wont be after all anyhow its all fixed and arranged aready and some sailors or other must go with him i suppose as well these as any other men god pity em morning to ye shipmates morning the ineffable heavens bless ye im sorry i stopped ye look here friend said i if you have anything important to tell us out with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle us you are mistaken in your game thats all i have to say and its said very well and i like to hear a chap talk up that way you are just the man for himthe likes of ye morning to ye shipmates morning oh when ye get there tell em ive concluded not to make one of em ah my dear fellow you cant fool us that wayyou cant fool us it is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him morning to ye shipmates morning morning it is said i come along queequeg lets leave this crazy man but stop tell me your name will you elijah elijah thought i and we walked away both commenting after each others fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards when chancing to turn a corner and looking back as i did so who should be seen but elijah following us though at a distance somehow the sight of him struck me so that i said nothing to queequeg of his being behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did he did and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine this circumstance coupled with his ambiguous halfhinting halfrevealing shrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and halfapprehensions and all connected with the pequod and captain ahab and the leg he had lost and the cape horn fit and the silver calabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the ship the day previous and the prediction of the squaw tistig and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred other shadowy things i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg and on that side of it retraced our steps but elijah passed on without seeming to notice us this relieved me and once more and finally as it seemed to me i pronounced him in my heart a humbug chapter all astir a day or two passed and there was great activity aboard the pequod not only were the old sails being mended but new sails were coming on board and bolts of canvas and coils of rigging in short everything betokened that the ships preparations were hurrying to a close captain peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp lookout upon the hands bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after nightfall on the day following queequegs signing the articles word was given at all the inns where the ships company were stopping that their chests must be on board before night for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing so queequeg and i got down our traps resolving however to sleep ashore till the last but it seems they always give very long notice in these cases and the ship did not sail for several days but no wonder there was a good deal to be done and there is no telling how many things to be thought of before the pequod was fully equipped every one knows what a multitude of thingsbeds saucepans knives and forks shovels and tongs napkins nutcrackers and what not are indispensable to the business of housekeeping just so with whaling which necessitates a threeyears housekeeping upon the wide ocean far from all grocers costermongers doctors bakers and bankers and though this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen for besides the great length of the whaling voyage the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented it must be remembered that of all ships whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends hence the spare boats spare spars and spare lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost but a spare captain and duplicate ship at the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storage of the pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water fuel and iron hoops and staves but as before hinted for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things both large and small chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captain bildads sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if _she_ could help it nothing should be found wanting in the pequod after once fairly getting to sea at one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the stewards pantry another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mates desk where he kept his log a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some ones rheumatic back never did any woman better deserve her name which was charityaunt charity as everybody called her and like a sister of charity did this charitable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety comfort and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother bildad was concerned and in which she herself owned a score or two of wellsaved dollars but it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on board as she did the last day with a long oilladle in one hand and a still longer whaling lance in the other nor was bildad himself nor captain peleg at all backward as for bildad he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper every once in a while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den roaring at the men down the hatchways roaring up to the riggers at the masthead and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam during these days of preparation queequeg and i often visited the craft and as often i asked about captain ahab and how he was and when he was going to come on board his ship to these questions they would answer that he was getting better and better and was expected aboard every day meantime the two captains peleg and bildad could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage if i had been downright honest with myself i would have seen very plainly in my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea but when a man suspects any wrong it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself and much this way it was with me i said nothing and tried to think nothing at last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail so next morning queequeg and i took a very early start chapter going aboard it was nearly six oclock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we drew nigh the wharf there are some sailors running ahead there if i see right said i to queequeg it cant be shadows shes off by sunrise i guess come on avast cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming close behind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and then insinuating himself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely peering from queequeg to me it was elijah going aboard hands off will you said i lookee here said queequeg shaking himself go way aint going aboard then yes we are said i but what business is that of yours do you know mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinent no no no i wasnt aware of that said elijah slowly and wonderingly looking from me to queequeg with the most unaccountable glances elijah said i you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing we are going to the indian and pacific oceans and would prefer not to be detained ye be be ye coming back afore breakfast hes cracked queequeg said i come on holloa cried stationary elijah hailing us when we had removed a few paces never mind him said i queequeg come on but he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder saiddid ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago struck by this plain matteroffact question i answered saying yes i thought i did see four or five men but it was too dim to be sure very dim very dim said elijah morning to ye once more we quitted him but once more he came softly after us and touching my shoulder again said see if you can find em now will ye find who morning to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off oh i was going to warn ye againstbut never mind never mindits all one all in the family toosharp frost this morning aint it goodbye to ye shant see ye again very soon i guess unless its before the grand jury and with these cracked words he finally departed leaving me for the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence at last stepping on board the pequod we found everything in profound quiet not a soul moving the cabin entrance was locked within the hatches were all on and lumbered with coils of rigging going forward to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing a light we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a tattered peajacket he was thrown at whole length upon two chests his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms the profoundest slumber slept upon him those sailors we saw queequeg where can they have gone to said i looking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when on the wharf queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter were it not for elijahs otherwise inexplicable question but i beat the thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body telling him to establish himself accordingly he put his hand upon the sleepers rear as though feeling if it was soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly down there gracious queequeg dont sit there said i oh perry dood seat said queequeg my country way wont hurt him face face said i call that his face very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes hes heaving himself get off queequeg you are heavy its grinding the face of the poor get off queequeg look hell twitch you off soon i wonder he dont wake queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the feet we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile upon questioning him in his broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in his land owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts the king chiefs and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows and lay them round in the piers and alcoves besides it was very convenient on an excursion much better than those gardenchairs which are convertible into walkingsticks upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps in some damp marshy place while narrating these things every time queequeg received the tomahawk from me he flourished the hatchetside of it over the sleepers head whats that for queequeg perry easy kille oh perry easy he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawkpipe which it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger the strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole it began to tell upon him he breathed with a sort of muffledness then seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and rubbed his eyes holloa he breathed at last who be ye smokers shipped men answered i when does she sail aye aye ye are going in her be ye she sails today the captain came aboard last night what captainahab who but him indeed i was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab when we heard a noise on deck holloa starbucks astir said the rigger hes a lively chief mate that good man and a pious but all alive now i must turn to and so saying he went on deck and we followed it was now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in twos and threes the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were actively engaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin chapter merry christmas at length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ships riggers and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf and after the everthoughtful charity had come off in a whaleboat with her last gifta nightcap for stubb the second mate her brotherinlaw and a spare bible for the stewardafter all this the two captains peleg and bildad issued from the cabin and turning to the chief mate peleg said now mr starbuck are you sure everything is right captain ahab is all readyjust spoke to himnothing more to be got from shore eh well call all hands then muster em aft hereblast em no need of profane words however great the hurry peleg said bildad but away with thee friend starbuck and do our bidding how now here upon the very point of starting for the voyage captain peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarterdeck just as if they were to be jointcommanders at sea as well as to all appearances in port and as for captain ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin but then the idea was that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea indeed as that was not at all his proper business but the pilots and as he was not yet completely recoveredso they saidtherefore captain ahab stayed below and all this seemed natural enough especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having a farewell merrymaking with their shore friends before they quit the ship for good with the pilot but there was not much chance to think over the matter for captain peleg was now all alive he seemed to do most of the talking and commanding and not bildad aft here ye sons of bachelors he cried as the sailors lingered at the mainmast mr starbuck drive em aft strike the tent therewas the next order as i hinted before this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor man the capstan blood and thunderjumpwas the next command and the crew sprang for the handspikes now in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with peleg be it known in addition to his other officers was one of the licensed pilots of the porthe being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the nantucket pilotfee to all the ships he was concerned in for he never piloted any other craftbildad i say might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley with hearty good will nevertheless not three days previous bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod particularly in getting under weigh and charity his sister had placed a small choice copy of watts in each seamans berth meantime overseeing the other part of the ship captain peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i paused on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking of the perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot i was comforting myself however with the thought that in pious bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundred and seventyseventh lay when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity that was my first kick is that the way they heave in the marchant service he roared spring thou sheephead spring and break thy backbone why dont ye spring i say all of yespring quohog spring thou chap with the red whiskers spring there scotchcap spring thou green pants spring i say all of ye and spring your eyes out and so saying he moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while imperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody thinks i captain peleg must have been drinking something today at last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we glided it was a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merged into night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor the long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving icicles depended from the bows lank bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon as the old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shivering frost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady notes were heard _sweet fields beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living green so to the jews old canaan stood while jordan rolled between_ never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then they were full of hope and fruition spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer at last we gained such an offing that the two pilots were needed no longer the stout sailboat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside it was curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad were affected at this juncture especially captain bildad for loath to depart yet very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyagebeyond both stormy capes a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested a ship in which an old shipmate sailed as captain a man almost as old as he once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw loath to say goodbye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to himpoor old bildad lingered long paced the deck with anxious strides ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck and looked to windward looked towards the wide and endless waters only bounded by the faroff unseen eastern continents looked towards the land looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding up a lantern for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face as much as to say nevertheless friend peleg i can stand it yes i can as for peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for all his philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near and he too did not a little run from cabin to decknow a word below and now a word with starbuck the chief mate but at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of look about himcaptain bildadcome old shipmate we must go back the mainyard there boat ahoy stand by to come close alongside now careful carefulcome bildad boysay your last luck to ye starbuckluck to ye mr stubbluck to ye mr flaskgoodbye and good luck to ye alland this day three years ill have a hot supper smoking for ye in old nantucket hurrah and away god bless ye and have ye in his holy keeping men murmured old bildad almost incoherently i hope yell have fine weather now so that captain ahab may soon be moving among yea pleasant sun is all he needs and yell have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go be careful in the hunt ye mates dont stave the boats needlessly ye harpooneers good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent within the year dont forget your prayers either mr starbuck mind that cooper dont waste the spare staves oh the sailneedles are in the green locker dont whale it too much a lords days men but dont miss a fair chance either thats rejecting heavens good gifts have an eye to the molasses tierce mr stubb it was a little leaky i thought if ye touch at the islands mr flask beware of fornication goodbye goodbye dont keep that cheese too long down in the hold mr starbuck itll spoil be careful with the buttertwenty cents the pound it was and mind ye if come come captain bildad stop palaveringaway and with that peleg hurried him over the side and both dropt into the boat ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between a screaming gull flew overhead the two hulls wildly rolled we gave three heavyhearted cheers and blindly plunged like fate into the lone atlantic chapter the lee shore some chapters back one bulkington was spoken of a tall newlanded mariner encountered in new bedford at the inn when on that shivering winters night the pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves who should i see standing at her helm but bulkington i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man who in midwinter just landed from a four years dangerous voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term the land seemed scorching to his feet wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable deep memories yield no epitaphs this sixinch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington let me only say that it fared with him as with the stormtossed ship that miserably drives along the leeward land the port would fain give succor the port is pitiful in the port is safety comfort hearthstone supper warm blankets friends all thats kind to our mortalities but in that gale the port the land is that ships direst jeopardy she must fly all hospitality one touch of land though it but graze the keel would make her shudder through and through with all her might she crowds all sail off shore in so doing fights gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward seeks all the lashed seas landlessness again for refuges sake forlornly rushing into peril her only friend her bitterest foe know ye now bulkington glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore but as in landlessness alone resides highest truth shoreless indefinite as godso better is it to perish in that howling infinite than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee even if that were safety for wormlike then oh who would craven crawl to land terrors of the terrible is all this agony so vain take heart take heart o bulkington bear thee grimly demigod up from the spray of thy oceanperishingstraight up leaps thy apotheosis chapter the advocate as queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore i am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales in the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact that among people at large the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions if a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits were he presented to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials swf sperm whale fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed preeminently presuming and ridiculous doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business and that when actively engaged therein we are surrounded by all manner of defilements butchers we are that is true but butchers also and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor and as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm whaleship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth but even granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery decks of a whaleship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battlefields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies plaudits and if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldiers profession let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whales vast tail fanning into eddies the air over his head for what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of god but though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage yea an allabounding adoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candles that burn round the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glory but look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts of scales see what we whalemen are and have been why did the dutch in de witts time have admirals of their whaling fleets why did louis xvi of france at his own personal expense fit out whaling ships from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of nantucket why did britain between the years and pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of and lastly how comes it that we whalemen of america now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels manned by eighteen thousand men yearly consuming of dollars the ships worth at the time of sailing and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of how comes all this if there be not something puissant in whaling but this is not the half look again i freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for his life point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one way and another it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues that whaling may well be regarded as that egyptian mother who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb it would be a hopeless endless task to catalogue all these things let a handful suffice for many years past the whaleship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth she has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed if american and european menofwar now peacefully ride in once savage harbors let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whaleship which originally showed them the way and first interpreted between them and the savages they may celebrate as they will the heroes of exploring expeditions your cooks your krusensterns but i say that scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket that were as great and greater than your cook and your krusenstern for in their succourless emptyhandedness they in the heathenish sharked waters and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands battled with virgin wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared all that is made such a flourish of in the old south sea voyages those things were but the lifetime commonplaces of our heroic nantucketers often adventures which vancouver dedicates three chapters to these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ships common log ah the world oh the world until the whale fishery rounded cape horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between europe and the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast it was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the spanish crown touching those colonies and if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts that great america on the other side of the sphere australia was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman after its first blunderborn discovery by a dutchman all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous but the whaleship touched there the whaleship is the true mother of that now mighty colony moreover in the infancy of the first australian settlement the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whaleship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters the uncounted isles of all polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage to the whaleship that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations if that doublebolted land japan is ever to become hospitable it is the whaleship alone to whom the credit will be due for already she is on the threshold but if in the face of all this you still declare that whaling has no æsthetically noble associations connected with it then am i ready to shiver fifty lances with you there and unhorse you with a split helmet every time the whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you will say _the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler_ who wrote the first account of our leviathan who but mighty job and who composed the first narrative of a whalingvoyage who but no less a prince than alfred the great who with his own royal pen took down the words from other the norwegian whalehunter of those times and who pronounced our glowing eulogy in parliament who but edmund burke true enough but then whalemen themselves are poor devils they have no good blood in their veins _no good blood in their veins_ they have something better than royal blood there the grandmother of benjamin franklin was mary morrel afterwards by marriage mary folger one of the old settlers of nantucket and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and harpooneersall kith and kin to noble benjaminthis day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other good again but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable _whaling not respectable_ whaling is imperial by old english statutory law the whale is declared a royal fish oh thats only nominal the whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing way _the whale never figured in any grand imposing way_ in one of the mighty triumphs given to a roman general upon his entering the worlds capital the bones of a whale brought all the way from the syrian coast were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession see subsequent chapters for something more on this head grant it since you cite it but say what you will there is no real dignity in whaling _no dignity in whaling_ the dignity of our calling the very heavens attest cetus is a constellation in the south no more drive down your hat in presence of the czar and take it off to queequeg no more i know a man that in his lifetime has taken three hundred and fifty whales i account that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns and as for me if by any possibility there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of if hereafter i shall do anything that upon the whole a man might rather have done than to have left undone if at my death my executors or more properly my creditors find any precious mss in my desk then here i prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling for a whaleship was my yale college and my harvard chapter postscript in behalf of the dignity of whaling i would fain advance naught but substantiated facts but after embattling his facts an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which might tell eloquently upon his causesuch an advocate would he not be blameworthy it is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens even modern ones a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through there is a saltcellar of state so called and there may be a castor of state how they use the salt preciselywho knows certain i am however that a kings head is solemnly oiled at his coronation even as a head of salad can it be though that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well as they anoint machinery much might be ruminated here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair and palpably smells of that anointing in truth a mature man who uses hairoil unless medicinally that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere as a general rule he cant amount to much in his totality but the only thing to be considered here is thiswhat kind of oil is used at coronations certainly it cannot be olive oil nor macassar oil nor castor oil nor bears oil nor train oil nor codliver oil what then can it possibly be but sperm oil in its unmanufactured unpolluted state the sweetest of all oils think of that ye loyal britons we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff chapter knights and squires the chief mate of the pequod was starbuck a native of nantucket and a quaker by descent he was a long earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes his flesh being hard as twicebaked biscuit transported to the indies his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale he must have been born in some time of general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous only some thirty arid summers had he seen those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness but this his thinness so to speak seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight it was merely the condensation of the man he was by no means illlooking quite the contrary his pure tight skin was an excellent fit and closely wrapped up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified egyptian this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come and to endure always as now for be it polar snow or torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates looking into his eyes you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousandfold perils he had calmly confronted through life a staid steadfast man whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action and not a tame chapter of sounds yet for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude there were certain qualities in him which at times affected and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in some organizations seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward portents and inward presentiments were his and if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul much more did his faraway domestic memories of his young cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those latent influences which in some honesthearted men restrain the gush of daredevil daring so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery i will have no man in my boat said starbuck who is not afraid of a whale by this he seemed to mean not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward aye aye said stubb the second mate starbuck there is as careful a man as youll find anywhere in this fishery but we shall ere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by a man like stubb or almost any other whale hunter starbuck was no crusader after perils in him courage was not a sentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions besides he thought perhaps that in this business of whaling courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly wasted wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sundown nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him for thought starbuck i am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew what doom was his own fathers where in the bottomless deeps could he find the torn limbs of his brother with memories like these in him and moreover given to a certain superstitiousness as has been said the courage of this starbuck which could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme but it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him which under suitable circumstances would break out from its confinement and burn all his courage up and brave as he might be it was that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas or winds or whales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world yet cannot withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terrors which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor starbucks fortitude scarce might i have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose the fall of valour in the soul men may seem detestable as joint stockcompanies and nations knaves fools and murderers there may be men may have mean and meagre faces but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves so far within us that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valorruined man nor can piety itself at such a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars but this august dignity i treat of is not the dignity of kings and robes but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike that democratic dignity which on all hands radiates without end from god himself the great god absolute the centre and circumference of all democracy his omnipresence our divine equality if then to meanest mariners and renegades and castaways i shall hereafter ascribe high qualities though dark weave round them tragic graces if even the most mournful perchance the most abased among them all shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts if i shall touch that workmans arm with some ethereal light if i shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun then against all mortal critics bear me out in it thou just spirit of equality which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind bear me out in it thou great democratic god who didst not refuse to the swart convict bunyan the pale poetic pearl thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold the stumped and paupered arm of old cervantes thou who didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebbles who didst hurl him upon a warhorse who didst thunder him higher than a throne thou who in all thy mighty earthly marchings ever cullest thy selectest champions from the kingly commons bear me out in it o god chapter knights and squires stubb was the second mate he was a native of cape cod and hence according to local usage was called a capecodman a happygolucky neither craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an indifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase toiling away calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year goodhumored easy and careless he presided over his whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his crew all invited guests he was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat as an old stagedriver is about the snugness of his box when close to the whale in the very deathlock of the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly and offhandedly as a whistling tinker his hammer he would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster long usage had for this stubb converted the jaws of death into an easy chair what he thought of death itself there is no telling whether he ever thought of it at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order and not sooner what perhaps with other things made stubb such an easygoing unfearing man so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars all bowed to the ground with their packs what helped to bring about that almost impious goodhumor of his that thing must have been his pipe for like his nose his short black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face you would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe he kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in readiness anew for when stubb dressed instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers he put his pipe into his mouth i say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of his peculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly air whether ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it and as in time of the cholera some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths so likewise against all mortal tribulations stubbs tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent the third mate was flask a native of tisbury in marthas vineyard a short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him to destroy them whenever encountered so utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse or at least waterrat requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil this ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales he followed these fish for the fun of it and a three years voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time as a carpenters nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly divided little flask was one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long they called him kingpost on board of the pequod because in form he could be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in arctic whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas now these three matesstarbuck stubb and flask were momentous men they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the pequods boats as headsmen in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales these three headsmen were as captains of companies or being armed with their long keen whaling spears they were as a picked trio of lancers even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins and since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothic knight of old is always accompanied by his boatsteerer or harpooneer who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance when the former one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault and moreover as there generally subsists between the two a close intimacy and friendliness it is therefore but meet that in this place we set down who the pequods harpooneers were and to what headsman each of them belonged first of all was queequeg whom starbuck the chief mate had selected for his squire but queequeg is already known next was tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly promontory of marthas vineyard where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men which has long supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers in the fishery they usually go by the generic name of gayheaders tashtegos long lean sable hair his high cheek bones and black rounding eyesfor an indian oriental in their largeness but antarctic in their glittering expressionall this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters who in quest of the great new england moose had scoured bow in hand the aboriginal forests of the main but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans and halfbelieved this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers of the air tashtego was stubb the second mates squire third among the harpooneers was daggoo a gigantic coalblack negrosavage with a lionlike treadan ahasuerus to behold suspended from his ears were two golden hoops so large that the sailors called them ringbolts and would talk of securing the topsail halyards to them in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his native coast and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues and erect as a giraffe moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks there was a corporeal humility in looking up at him and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress curious to tell this imperial negro ahasuerus daggoo was the squire of little flask who looked like a chessman beside him as for the residue of the pequods company be it said that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the american whale fishery are americans born though pretty nearly all the officers are herein it is the same with the american whale fishery as with the american army and military and merchant navies and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the american canals and railroads the same i say because in all these cases the native american liberally provides the brains the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles no small number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores where the outward bound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores in like manner the greenland whalers sailing out of hull or london put in at the shetland islands to receive the full complement of their crew upon the passage homewards they drop them there again how it is there is no telling but islanders seem to make the best whalemen they were nearly all islanders in the pequod _isolatoes_ too i call such not acknowledging the common continent of men but each _isolato_ living on a separate continent of his own yet now federated along one keel what a set these isolatoes were an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea and all the ends of the earth accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the worlds grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back black little piphe never didoh no he went before poor alabama boy on the grim pequods forecastle ye shall ere long see him beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time when sent for to the great quarterdeck on high he was bid strike in with angels and beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero there chapter ahab for several days after leaving nantucket nothing above hatches was seen of captain ahab the mates regularly relieved each other at the watches and for aught that could be seen to the contrary they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously yes their supreme lord and dictator was there though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin every time i ascended to the deck from my watches below i instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a perturbation this was strangely heightened at times by the ragged elijahs diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived of but poorly could i withstand them much as in other moods i was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves but whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasinessto call it sowhich i felt yet whenever i came to look about me in the ship it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions for though the harpooneers with the great body of the crew were a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of the tame merchantship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with still i ascribed thisand rightly ascribed itto the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked but it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship the mates which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage three better more likely seaofficers and men each in his own different way could not readily be found and they were every one of them americans a nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man now it being christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor for a space we had biting polar weather though all the time running away from it to the southward and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed gradually leaving that merciless winter and all its intolerable weather behind us it was one of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that as i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as i levelled my glance towards the taffrail foreboding shivers ran over me reality outran apprehension captain ahab stood upon his quarterdeck there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him nor of the recovery from any he looked like a man cut away from the stake when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness his whole high broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an unalterable mould like cellinis cast perseus threading its way out from among his grey hairs and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing you saw a slender rodlike mark lividly whitish it resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it and without wrenching a single twig peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded whether that mark was born with him or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound no one could certainly say by some tacit consent throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it especially by the mates but once tashtegos senior an old gayhead indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did ahab become that way branded and then it came upon him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at sea yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey manxman insinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of nantucket had never ere this laid eye upon wild ahab nevertheless the old seatraditions the immemorial credulities popularly invested this old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment so that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever captain ahab should be tranquilly laid outwhich might hardly come to pass so he mutteredthen whoever should do that last office for the dead would find a birthmark on him from crown to sole so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the first few moments i hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood it had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whales jaw aye he was dismasted off japan said the old gayhead indian once but like his dismasted craft he shipped another mast without coming home for it he has a quiver of em i was struck with the singular posture he maintained upon each side of the pequods quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds there was an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into the plank his bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and holding by a shroud captain ahab stood erect looking straight out beyond the ships everpitching prow there was an infinity of firmest fortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed and fearless forward dedication of that glance not a word he spoke nor did his officers say aught to him though by all their minutest gestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful consciousness of being under a troubled mastereye and not only that but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe ere long from his first visit in the air he withdrew into his cabin but after that morning he was every day visible to the crew either standing in his pivothole or seated upon an ivory stool he had or heavily walking the deck as the sky grew less gloomy indeed began to grow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse as if when the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded and by and by it came to pass that he was almost continually in the air but as yet for all that he said or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast but the pequod was only making a passage now not regularly cruising nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to so that there was little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite ahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon nevertheless ere long the warm warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm him from his mood for as when the redcheeked dancing girls april and may trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest ruggedest most thundercloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to welcome such gladhearted visitants so ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look which in any other man would have soon flowered out in a smile chapter enter ahab to him stubb some days elapsed and ice and icebergs all astern the pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring which at sea almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic the warmly cool clear ringing perfumed overflowing redundant days were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet heaped upflaked up with rosewater snow the starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of their absent conquering earls the golden helmeted suns for sleeping man twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights but all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world inward they turned upon the soul especially when the still mild hours of eve came on then memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights and all these subtle agencies more and more they wrought on ahabs texture old age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death among seacommanders the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the nightcloaked deck it was so with ahab only that now of late he seemed so much to live in the open air that truly speaking his visits were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks it feels like going down into ones tombhe would mutter to himselffor an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to my gravedug berth so almost every twentyfour hours when the watches of the night were set and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailors flung it not rudely down as by day but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the silent steersman would watch the cabinscuttle and ere long the old man would emerge gripping at the iron banister to help his crippled way some considering touch of humanity was in him for at times like these he usually abstained from patrolling the quarterdeck because to his wearied mates seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks but once the mood was on him too deep for common regardings and as with heavy lumberlike pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast stubb the old second mate came up from below with a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that if captain ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay but there might be some way of muffling the noise hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertion into it of the ivory heel ah stubb thou didst not know ahab then am i a cannonball stubb said ahab that thou wouldst wad me that fashion but go thy ways i had forgot below to thy nightly grave where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the filling one at lastdown dog and kennel starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man stubb was speechless a moment then said excitedly i am not used to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than half like it sir avast gritted ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away as if to avoid some passionate temptation no sir not yet said stubb emboldened i will not tamely be called a dog sir then be called ten times a donkey and a mule and an ass and begone or ill clear the world of thee as he said this ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect that stubb involuntarily retreated i was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it muttered stubb as he found himself descending the cabinscuttle its very queer stop stubb somehow now i dont well know whether to go back and strike him orwhats thatdown here on my knees and pray for him yes that was the thought coming up in me but it would be the first time i ever _did_ pray its queer very queer and hes queer too aye take him fore and aft hes about the queerest old man stubb ever sailed with how he flashed at mehis eyes like powderpans is he mad anyway theres something on his mind as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks he aint in his bed now either more than three hours out of the twentyfour and he dont sleep then didnt that doughboy the steward tell me that of a morning he always finds the old mans hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheets down at the foot and the coverlid almost tied into knots and the pillow a sort of frightful hot as though a baked brick had been on it a hot old man i guess hes got what some folks ashore call a conscience its a kind of ticdollyrow they sayworse nor a toothache well well i dont know what it is but the lord keep me from catching it hes full of riddles i wonder what he goes into the after hold for every night as doughboy tells me he suspects whats that for i should like to know whos made appointments with him in the hold aint that queer now but theres no telling its the old gamehere goes for a snooze damn me its worth a fellows while to be born into the world if only to fall right asleep and now that i think of it thats about the first thing babies do and thats a sort of queer too damn me but all things are queer come to think of em but thats against my principles think not is my eleventh commandment and sleep when you can is my twelfthso here goes again but hows that didnt he call me a dog blazes he called me ten times a donkey and piled a lot of jackasses on top of _that_ he might as well have kicked me and done with it maybe he _did_ kick me and i didnt observe it i was so taken all aback with his brow somehow it flashed like a bleached bone what the devils the matter with me i dont stand right on my legs coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out by the lord i must have been dreaming thoughhow how howbut the only ways to stash it so here goes to hammock again and in the morning ill see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight chapter the pipe when stubb had departed ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks and then as had been usual with him of late calling a sailor of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck he sat and smoked in old norse times the thrones of the sealoving danish kings were fabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the narwhale how could one look at ahab then seated on that tripod of bones without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized for a khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of leviathans was ahab some moments passed during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs which blew back again into his face how now he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube this smoking no longer soothes oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone here have i been unconsciously toiling not pleasuringaye and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward and with such nervous whiffs as if like the dying whale my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble what business have i with this pipe this thing that is meant for sereneness to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs not among torn irongrey locks like mine ill smoke no more he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea the fire hissed in the waves the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made with slouched hat ahab lurchingly paced the planks chapter queen mab next morning stubb accosted flask such a queer dream kingpost i never had you know the old mans ivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me with it and when i tried to kick back upon my soul my little man i kicked my leg right off and then presto ahab seemed a pyramid and i like a blazing fool kept kicking at it but what was still more curious flaskyou know how curious all dreams arethrough all this rage that i was in i somehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult that kick from ahab why thinks i whats the row its not a real leg only a false leg and theres a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump thats what makes a blow from the hand flask fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane the living memberthat makes the living insult my little man and thinks i to myself all the while mind while i was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramidso confoundedly contradictory was it all all the while i say i was thinking to myself whats his leg now but a canea whalebone cane yes thinks i it was only a playful cudgellingin fact only a whaleboning that he gave menot a base kick besides thinks i look at it once why the end of itthe foot partwhat a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer kicked me _theres_ a devilish broad insult but this insult is whittled down to a point only but now comes the greatest joke of the dream flask while i was battering away at the pyramid a sort of badgerhaired old merman with a hump on his back takes me by the shoulders and slews me round what are you bout says he slid man but i was frightened such a phiz but somehow next moment i was over the fright what am i about says i at last and what business is that of yours i should like to know mr humpback do _you_ want a kick by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turned round his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a cloutwhat do you think i sawwhy thunder alive man his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes with the points out says i on second thoughts i guess i wont kick you old fellow wise stubb said he wise stubb and kept muttering it all the time a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag seeing he wasnt going to stop saying over his wise stubb wise stubb i thought i might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again but i had only just lifted my foot for it when he roared out stop that kicking halloa says i whats the matter now old fellow look ye here says he lets argue the insult captain ahab kicked ye didnt he yes he did says iright _here_ it was very good says hehe used his ivory leg didnt he yes he did says i well then says he wise stubb what have you to complain of didnt he kick with right good will it wasnt a common pitch pine leg he kicked with was it no you were kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb its an honor i consider it an honor listen wise stubb in old england the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made garterknights of but be _your_ boast stubb that ye were kicked by old ahab and made a wise man of remember what i say _be_ kicked by him account his kicks honors and on no account kick back for you cant help yourself wise stubb dont you see that pyramid with that he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into the air i snored rolled over and there i was in my hammock now what do you think of that dream flask i dont know it seems a sort of foolish to me tho may be may be but its made a wise man of me flask dye see ahab standing there sideways looking over the stern well the best thing you can do flask is to let the old man alone never speak to him whatever he says halloa whats that he shouts hark masthead there look sharp all of ye there are whales hereabouts if ye see a white one split your lungs for him what do you think of that now flask aint there a small drop of something queer about that eh a white whaledid ye mark that man look yetheres something special in the wind stand by for it flask ahab has that thats bloody on his mind but mum he comes this way chapter cetology already we are boldly launched upon the deep but soon we shall be lost in its unshored harbourless immensities ere that come to pass ere the pequods weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera that i would now fain put before you yet is it no easy task the classification of the constituents of a chaos nothing less is here essayed listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down no branch of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled cetology says captain scoresby ad it is not my intention were it in my power to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal sperm whale says surgeon beale ad unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea a field strewn with thorns all these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists thus speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson those lights of zoology and anatomy nevertheless though of real knowledge there be little yet of books there are a plenty and so in some small degree with cetology or the science of whales many are the men small and great old and new landsmen and seamen who have at large or in little written of the whale run over a fewthe authors of the bible aristotle pliny aldrovandi sir thomas browne gesner ray linnæus rondeletius willoughby green artedi sibbald brisson marten lacépède bonneterre desmarest baron cuvier frederick cuvier john hunter owen scoresby beale bennett j ross browne the author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev t cheever but to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written the above cited extracts will show of the names in this list of whale authors only those following owen ever saw living whales and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman i mean captain scoresby on the separate subject of the greenland or rightwhale he is the best existing authority but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas he is not even by any means the largest of the whales yet owing to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown spermwhale and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whaleports this usurpation has been every way complete reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days will satisfy you that the greenland whale without one rival was to them the monarch of the seas but the time has at last come for a new proclamation this is charing cross hear ye good people allthe greenland whale is deposedthe great sperm whale now reigneth there are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt those books are beales and bennetts both in their time surgeons to english southsea whaleships and both exact and reliable men the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small but so far as it goes it is of excellent quality though mostly confined to scientific description as yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic lives not complete in any literature far above all other hunted whales his is an unwritten life now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the present hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers as no better man advances to take this matter in hand i hereupon offer my own poor endeavors i promise nothing complete because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species orin this place at leastto much of any description my object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology i am the architect not the builder but it is a ponderous task no ordinary lettersorter in the postoffice is equal to it to grope down into the bottom of the sea after them to have ones hands among the unspeakable foundations ribs and very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing what am i that i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan the awful tauntings in job might well appal me will he the leviathan make a covenant with thee behold the hope of him is vain but i have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans i have had to do with whales with these visible hands i am in earnest and i will try there are some preliminaries to settle first the uncertain unsettled condition of this science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish in his system of nature ad linnæus declares i hereby separate the whales from the fish but of my own knowledge i know that down to the year sharks and shad alewives and herring against linnæuss express edict were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the leviathan the grounds upon which linnæus would fain have banished the whales from the waters he states as follows on account of their warm bilocular heart their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege naturæ jure meritoque i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley coffin of nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient charley profanely hinted they were humbug be it known that waiving all argument i take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy jonah to back me this fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish above linnæus has given you those items but in brief they are these lungs and warm blood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded next how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come to be short then a whale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_ there you have him however contracted that definition is the result of expanded meditation a walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is not a fish because he is amphibious but the last term of the definition is still more cogent as coupled with the first almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat but a vertical or upanddown tail whereas among spouting fish the tail though it may be similarly shaped invariably assumes a horizontal position by the above definition of what a whale is i do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed nantucketers nor on the other hand link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this groundplan of cetology now then come the grand divisions of the entire whale host i am aware that down to the present time the fish styled lamatins and dugongs pigfish and sowfish of the coffins of nantucket are included by many naturalists among the whales but as these pigfish are a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on wet hay and especially as they do not spout i deny their credentials as whales and have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of cetology first according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primary books subdivisible into chapters and these shall comprehend them all both small and large i the folio whale ii the octavo whale iii the duodecimo whale as the type of the folio i present the _sperm whale_ of the octavo the _grampus_ of the duodecimo the _porpoise_ folios among these i here include the following chaptersi the _sperm whale_ ii the _right whale_ iii the _finback whale_ iv the _humpbacked whale_ v the _razor back whale_ vi the _sulphur bottom whale_ book i _folio_ chapter i _sperm whale_this whale among the english of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale and the physeter whale and the anvil headed whale is the present cachalot of the french and the pottsfich of the germans and the macrocephalus of the long words he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe the most formidable of all whales to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being the only creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti is obtained all his peculiarities will in many other places be enlarged upon it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do philologically considered it is absurd some centuries ago when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish in those days spermaceti it would seem was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland or right whale it was the idea also that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses in those times also spermaceti was exceedingly scarce not being used for light but only as an ointment and medicament it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb when as i opine in the course of time the true nature of spermaceti became known its original name was still retained by the dealers no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity and so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived book i _folio_ chapter ii _right whale_in one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans being the one first regularly hunted by man it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen and the oil specially known as whale oil an inferior article in commerce among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles the whale the greenland whale the black whale the great whale the true whale the right whale there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised what then is the whale which i include in the second species of my folios it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalists the greenland whale of the english whalemen the baleine ordinaire of the french whalemen the growlands walfish of the swedes it is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas it is the whale which the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean on the brazil banks on the nor west coast and various other parts of the world designated by them right whale cruising grounds some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the english and the right whale of the americans but they precisely agree in all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction it is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length with reference to elucidating the sperm whale book i _folio_ chapter iii _finback_under this head i reckon a monster which by the various names of finback tallspout and longjohn has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the atlantic in the new york packettracks in the length he attains and in his baleen the finback resembles the right whale but is of a less portly girth and a lighter colour approaching to olive his great lips present a cablelike aspect formed by the intertwisting slanting folds of large wrinkles his grand distinguishing feature the fin from which he derives his name is often a conspicuous object this fin is some three or four feet long growing vertically from the hinder part of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will at times be seen plainly projecting from the surface when the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked with spherical ripples and this gnomonlike fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial with its style and wavy hourlines graved on it on that ahazdial the shadow often goes back the finback is not gregarious he seems a whalehater as some men are manhaters very shy always going solitary unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming as to defy all present pursuit from man this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race bearing for his mark that style upon his back from having the baleen in his mouth the finback is sometimes included with the right whale among a theoretic species denominated _whalebone whales_ that is whales with baleen of these so called whalebone whales there would seem to be several varieties most of which however are little known broadnosed whales and beaked whales pikeheaded whales bunched whales underjawed whales and rostrated whales are the fishermens names for a few sorts in connection with this appellative of whalebone whales it is of great importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan founded upon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions which the whale in his kinds presents how then the baleen hump backfin and teeth these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars thus the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases then this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these has baleen but there again the similitude ceases and it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned in various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations or in the case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis on this rock every one of the whalenaturalists has split but it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts of the whale in his anatomythere at least we shall be able to hit the right classification nay what thing for example is there in the greenland whales anatomy more striking than his baleen yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the greenland whale and if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated what then remains nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way and this is the bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only one that can possibly succeed for it alone is practicable to proceed book i _folio_ chapter iv _hump back_this whale is often seen on the northern american coast he has been frequently captured there and towed into harbor he has a great pack on him like a peddler or you might call him the elephant and castle whale at any rate the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one his oil is not very valuable he has baleen he is the most gamesome and lighthearted of all the whales making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them book i _folio_ chapter v _razor back_of this whale little is known but his name i have seen him at a distance off cape horn of a retiring nature he eludes both hunters and philosophers though no coward he has never yet shown any part of him but his back which rises in a long sharp ridge let him go i know little more of him nor does anybody else book i _folio_ chapter vi _sulphur bottom_another retiring gentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping along the tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings he is seldom seen at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance he is never chased he would run away with ropewalks of line prodigies are told of him adieu sulphur bottom i can say nothing more that is true of ye nor can the oldest nantucketer thus ends book i _folio_ and now begins book ii _octavo_ octavoesthese embrace the whales of middling magnitude among which present may be numberedi the _grampus_ ii the _black fish_ iii the _narwhale_ iv the _thrasher_ v the _killer_ why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain because while the whales of this order though smaller than those of the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure yet the bookbinders quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume does book ii _octavo_ chapter i _grampus_though this fish whose loud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has furnished a proverb to landsmen is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not popularly classed among whales but possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan most naturalists have recognised him for one he is of moderate octavo size varying from fifteen to twentyfive feet in length and of corresponding dimensions round the waist he swims in herds he is never regularly hunted though his oil is considerable in quantity and pretty good for light by some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale book ii _octavo_ chapter ii _black fish_i give the popular fishermens names for all these fish for generally they are the best where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive i shall say so and suggest another i do so now touching the black fish socalled because blackness is the rule among almost all whales so call him the hyena whale if you please his voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards he carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face this whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length he is found in almost all latitudes he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming which looks something like a roman nose when not more profitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employmentas some frugal housekeepers in the absence of company and quite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax though their blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil book ii _octavo_ chapter iii _narwhale_ that is _nostril whale_another instance of a curiously named whale so named i suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose the creature is some sixteen feet in length while its horn averages five feet though some exceed ten and even attain to fifteen feet strictly speaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal but it is only found on the sinister side which has an ill effect giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy lefthanded man what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers it would be hard to say it does not seem to be used like the blade of the swordfish and billfish though some sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food charley coffin said it was used for an icepiercer for the narwhale rising to the surface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice thrusts his horn up and so breaks through but you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct my own opinion is that however this onesided horn may really be used by the narwhalehowever that may beit would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale the horned whale and the unicorn whale he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature from certain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this same seaunicorns horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison and as such preparations of it brought immense prices it was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that voyage when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of greenwich palace as his bold ship sailed down the thames when sir martin returned from that voyage saith black letter on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the narwhale which for a long period after hung in the castle at windsor an irish author avers that the earl of leicester on bended knees did likewise present to her highness another horn pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature the narwhale has a very picturesque leopardlike look being of a milkwhite ground colour dotted with round and oblong spots of black his oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas book ii _octavo_ chapter iv _killer_of this whale little is precisely known to the nantucketer and nothing at all to the professed naturalist from what i have seen of him at a distance i should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus he is very savagea sort of feegee fish he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip and hangs there like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to death the killer is never hunted i never heard what sort of oil he has exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground of its indistinctness for we are all killers on land and on sea bonapartes and sharks included book ii _octavo_ chapter v _thrasher_this gentleman is famous for his tail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes he mounts the folio whales back and as he swims he works his passage by flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer both are outlaws even in the lawless seas thus ends book ii _octavo_ and begins book iii _duodecimo_ duodecimoesthese include the smaller whales i the huzza porpoise ii the algerine porpoise iii the mealymouthed porpoise to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may possibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among whalesa word which in the popular sense always conveys an idea of hugeness but the creatures set down above as duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms of my definition of what a whale is_ie_ a spouting fish with a horizontal tail book iii _duodecimo_ chapter _huzza porpoise_this is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe the name is of my own bestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoises and something must be done to distinguish them i call him thus because he always swims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a fourthofjuly crowd their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner full of fine spirits they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward they are the lads that always live before the wind they are accounted a lucky omen if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye a wellfed plump huzza porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil but the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable it is in request among jewellers and watchmakers sailors put it on their hones porpoise meat is good eating you know it may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts indeed his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible but the next time you have a chance watch him and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature book iii _duodecimo_ chapter ii _algerine porpoise_a pirate very savage he is only found i think in the pacific he is somewhat larger than the huzza porpoise but much of the same general make provoke him and he will buckle to a shark i have lowered for him many times but never yet saw him captured book iii _duodecimo_ chapter iii _mealymouthed porpoise_the largest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific so far as it is known the only english name by which he has hitherto been designated is that of the fishersrightwhale porpoise from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio in shape he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of quite a neat and gentlemanlike figure he has no fins on his back most other porpoises have he has a lovely tail and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel hue but his mealymouth spoils all though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in a ships hull called the bright waist that line streaks him from stem to stern with two separate colours black above and white below the white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a mealbag a most mean and mealy aspect his oil is much like that of the common porpoise beyond the duodecimo this system does not proceed inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales above you have all the leviathans of note but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive halffabulous whales which as an american whaleman i know by reputation but not personally i shall enumerate them by their forecastle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators who may complete what i have here but begun if any of the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked then he can readily be incorporated into this system according to his folio octavo or duodecimo magnitudethe bottlenose whale the junk whale the puddingheaded whale the cape whale the leading whale the cannon whale the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whale the iceberg whale the quog whale the blue whale etc from icelandic dutch and old english authorities there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names but i omit them as altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds full of leviathanism but signifying nothing finally it was stated at the outset that this system would not be here and at once perfected you cannot but plainly see that i have kept my word but i now leave my cetological system standing thus unfinished even as the great cathedral of cologne was left with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower for small erections may be finished by their first architects grand ones true ones ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep me from ever completing anything this whole book is but a draughtnay but the draught of a draught oh time strength cash and patience chapter the specksnyder concerning the officers of the whalecraft this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on shipboard arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whalefleet the large importance attached to the harpooneers vocation is evinced by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two centuries and more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain but was divided between him and an officer called the specksnyder literally this word means fatcutter usage however in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer in those days the captains authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel while over the whalehunting department and all its concerns the specksnyder or chief harpooneer reigned supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted title of specksioneer this old dutch official is still retained but his former dignity is sadly abridged at present he ranks simply as senior harpooneer and as such is but one of the captains more inferior subalterns nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat but under certain circumstances night watches on a whaling ground the command of the ships deck is also his therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior though always by them familiarly regarded as their social equal now the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea is thisthe first lives aft the last forward hence in whaleships and merchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with the captain and so too in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship that is to say they take their meals in the captains cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it though the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar perils of it and the community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom high or low depend for their profits not upon fixed wages but upon their common luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and hard work though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally yet never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may in some primitive instances live together for all that the punctilious externals at least of the quarterdeck are seldom materially relaxed and in no instance done away indeed many are the nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarterdeck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple and not the shabbiest of pilotcloth and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage he ever exacted was implicit instantaneous obedience though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarterdeck and though there were times when owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed he addressed them in unusual terms whether of condescension or _in terrorem_ or otherwise yet even captain ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea nor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behind those forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himself incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve that certain sultanism of his brain which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship for be a mans intellectual superiority what it will it can never assume the practical available supremacy over other men without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments always in themselves more or less paltry and base this it is that for ever keeps gods true princes of the empire from the worlds hustings and leaves the highest honors that this air can give to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency but when as in the case of nicholas the czar the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization nor will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in his art as the one now alluded to but ahab my captain still moves before me in all his nantucket grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching emperors and kings i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old whalehunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me oh ahab what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for in the deep and featured in the unbodied air chapter the cabintable it is noon and doughboy the steward thrusting his pale loafofbread face from the cabinscuttle announces dinner to his lord and master who sitting in the lee quarterboat has just been taking an observation of the sun and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth medallionshaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to the tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial but presently catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to the deck and in an even unexhilarated voice saying dinner mr starbuck disappears into the cabin when the last echo of his sultans step has died away and starbuck the first emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated then starbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along the planks and after a grave peep into the binnacle says with some touch of pleasantness dinner mr stubb and descends the scuttle the second emir lounges about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking the main brace to see whether it will be all right with that important rope he likewise takes up the old burden and with a rapid dinner mr flask follows after his predecessors but the third emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarterdeck seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking off his shoes he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand turks head and then by a dexterous sleight pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck reversing all other processions by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and then independent hilarious little flask enters king ahabs presence in the character of abjectus or the slave it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of seausages that while in the open air of the deck some officers will upon provocation bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commanders cabin and straightway their inoffensive not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him as he sits at the head of the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this difference a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king of babylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinnertable of invited guests that mans unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time that mans royalty of state transcends belshazzars for belshazzar was not the greatest who has but once dined his friends has tasted what it is to be cæsar it is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding now if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a shipmaster then by inference you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sealife just mentioned over his ivoryinlaid table ahab presided like a mute maned sealion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs in his own proper turn each officer waited to be served they were as little children before ahab and yet in ahab there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mind their intent eyes all fastened upon the old mans knife as he carved the chief dish before him i do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation even upon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reaching out his knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked ahab thereby motioned starbucks plate towards him the mate received his meat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little started if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection for like the coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation only he himself was dumb what a relief it was to choking stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below and poor little flask he was the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party his were the shinbones of the saline beef his would have been the drumsticks for flask to have presumed to help himself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say ahab never forbade him and had flask helped himself the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it least of all did flask presume to help himself to butter whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account of its clotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long a voyage in such marketless waters butter was at a premium and therefore was not for him a subaltern however it was flask alas was a butterless man another thing flask was the last person down at the dinner and flask is the first man up consider for hereby flasks dinner was badly jammed in point of time starbuck and stubb both had the start of him and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear if stubb even who is but a peg higher than flask happens to have but a small appetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then flask must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck therefore it was that flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry more or less for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departed from my stomach i am an officer but how i wish i could fish a bit of oldfashioned beef in the forecastle as i used to when i was before the mast theres the fruits of promotion now theres the vanity of glory theres the insanity of life besides if it were so that any mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flasks official capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance was to go aft at dinnertime and get a peep at flask through the cabin skylight sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab now ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the pequods cabin after their departure taking place in inverted order to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward and then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast they being its residuary legatees they made a sort of temporary servants hall of the high and mighty cabin in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captains table was the entire carefree license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers while their masters the mates seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it they dined like lords they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast often the pale doughboy was fain to bring on a great baron of saltjunk seemingly quarried out of the solid ox and if he were not lively about it if he did not go with a nimble hopskipandjump then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back harpoonwise and once daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted doughboys memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him he was naturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little fellow this breadfaced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages doughboys whole life was one continual lipquiver commonly after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door till all was over it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego opposing his filed teeth to the indians crosswise to them daggoo seated on the floor for a bench would have brought his hearseplumed head to the low carlines at every motion of his colossal limbs making the low cabin framework to shake as when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship but for all this the great negro was wonderfully abstemious not to say dainty it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad baronial and superb a person but doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds not by beef or by bread are giants made or nourished but queequeg he had a mortal barbaric smack of the lip in eatingan ugly sound enoughso much so that the trembling doughboy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce himself that his bones might be picked the simplewitted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for their lances and other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor doughboy how could he forget that in his island days queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of some murderous convivial indiscretions alas doughboy hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals not a napkin should he carry on his arm but a buckler in good time though to his great delight the three saltsea warriors would rise and depart to his credulous fablemongering ears all their martial bones jingling in them at every step like moorish scimetars in scabbards but though these barbarians dined in the cabin and nominally lived there still being anything but sedentary in their habits they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes and just before sleepingtime when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters in this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most american whale captains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ships cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is at any time permitted there so that in real truth the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it for when they did enter it it was something as a streetdoor enters a house turning inwards for a moment only to be turned out the next and as a permanent thing residing in the open air nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin was no companionship socially ahab was inaccessible though nominally included in the census of christendom he was still an alien to it he lived in the world as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled missouri and as when spring and summer had departed that wild logan of the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling old age ahabs soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom chapter the masthead it was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the other seamen my first masthead came round in most american whalemen the mastheads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessels leaving her port even though she may have fifteen thousand miles and more to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground and if after a three four or five years voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in hersay an empty vial eventhen her mastheads are kept manned to the last and not till her skysailpoles sail in among the spires of the port does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more now as the business of standing mastheads ashore or afloat is a very ancient and interesting one let us in some measure expatiate here i take it that the earliest standers of mastheads were the old egyptians because in all my researches i find none prior to them for though their progenitors the builders of babel must doubtless by their tower have intended to rear the loftiest masthead in all asia or africa either yet ere the final truck was put to it as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the dread gale of gods wrath therefore we cannot give these babel builders priority over the egyptians and that the egyptians were a nation of masthead standers is an assertion based upon the general belief among archæologists that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stairlike formation of all four sides of those edifices whereby with prodigious long upliftings of their legs those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new stars even as the lookouts of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearing in sight in saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old times who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless standerofmastheads who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiantly facing everything out to the last literally died at his post of modern standersofmastheads we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiff gale are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight there is napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome stands with arms folded some one hundred and fifty feet in the air careless now who rules the decks below whether louis philippe louis blanc or louis the devil great washington too stands high aloft on his towering mainmast in baltimore and like one of hercules pillars his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go admiral nelson also on a capstan of gunmetal stands his masthead in trafalgar square and ever when most obscured by that london smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero is there for where there is smoke must be fire but neither great washington nor napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze however it may be surmised that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the masthead standers of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not so is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy the sole historian of nantucket stands accountable the worthy obed tells us that in the early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game the people of that island erected lofty spars along the seacoast to which the lookouts ascended by means of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in a henhouse a few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand who upon descrying the game gave notice to the readymanned boats nigh the beach but this custom has now become obsolete turn we then to the one proper masthead that of a whaleship at sea the three mastheads are kept manned from sunrise to sunset the seamen taking their regular turns as at the helm and relieving each other every two hours in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the masthead nay to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful there you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks striding along the deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while beneath you and between your legs as it were swim the hugest monsters of the sea even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old rhodes there you stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with nothing ruffled but the waves the tranced ship indolently rolls the drowsy trade winds blow everything resolves you into languor for the most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulness invests you you hear no news read no gazettes extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements you hear of no domestic afflictions bankrupt securities fall of stocks are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinnerfor all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks and your bill of fare is immutable in one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four years voyage as often happens the sum of the various hours you spend at the masthead would amount to several entire months and it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling such as pertains to a bed a hammock a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves your most usual point of perch is the head of the t gallantmast where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks almost peculiar to whalemen called the t gallant crosstrees here tossed about by the sea the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bulls horns to be sure in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape of a watchcoat but properly speaking the thickest watchcoat is no more of a house than the unclad body for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle and cannot freely move about in it nor even move out of it without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in winter so a watchcoat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope or additional skin encasing you you cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watchcoat concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mastheads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits called _crowsnests_ in which the lookouts of a greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas in the fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled a voyage among the icebergs in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the rediscovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland in this admirable volume all standers of mastheads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented _crowsnest_ of the glacier which was the name of captain sleets good craft he called it the _sleets crowsnest_ in honor of himself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from all ridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own children after our own names we fathers being the original inventors and patentees so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget in shape the sleets crowsnest is something like a large tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with a movable sidescreen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into it through a little traphatch in the bottom on the after side or side next the stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrellas comforters and coats in front is a leather rack in which to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope and other nautical conveniences when captain sleet in person stood his masthead in this crowsnest of his he tells us that he always had a rifle with him also fixed in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing now it was plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe as he does all the little detailed conveniences of his crowsnest but though he so enlarges upon many of these and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crowsnest with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the local attraction of all binnacle magnets an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ships planks and in the glaciers case perhaps to there having been so many brokendown blacksmiths among her crew i say that though the captain is very discreet and scientific here yet for all his learned binnacle deviations azimuth compass observations and approximate errors he knows very well captain sleet that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little casebottle so nicely tucked in on one side of his crows nest within easy reach of his hand though upon the whole i greatly admire and even love the brave the honest and learned captain yet i take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that casebottle seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that birds nest within three or four perches of the pole but if we southern whalefishers are not so snugly housed aloft as captain sleet and his greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage is greatly counterbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float for one i used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a chat with queequeg or any one else off duty whom i might find there then ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over the topsail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pastures and so at last mount to my ultimate destination let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that i kept but sorry guard with the problem of the universe revolving in me how could ibeing left completely to myself at such a thoughtengendering altitudehow could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whaleships standing orders keep your weather eye open and sing out every time and let me in this place movingly admonish you ye shipowners of nantucket beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativeness and who offers to ship with the phædon instead of bowditch in his head beware of such an one i say your whales must be seen before they can be killed and this sunkeneyed young platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer nor are these monitions at all unneeded for nowadays the whalefishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absentminded young men disgusted with the carking cares of earth and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the masthead of some luckless disappointed whaleship and in moody phrase ejaculates roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll ten thousand blubberhunters sweep over thee in vain very often do the captains of such ships take those absentminded young philosophers to task upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient interest in the voyage halfhinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise but all in vain those young platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect they are shortsighted what use then to strain the visual nerve they have left their operaglasses at home why thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lads weve been cruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised a whale yet whales are scarce as hens teeth whenever thou art up here perhaps they were or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon but lulled into such an opiumlike listlessness of vacant unconscious reverie is this absentminded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts that at last he loses his identity takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep blue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every strange halfseen gliding beautiful thing that eludes him every dimlydiscovered uprising fin of some undiscernible form seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it in this enchanted mood thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came becomes diffused through time and space like cranmers sprinkled pantheistic ashes forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over there is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea from the inscrutable tides of god but while this sleep this dream is on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your identity comes back in horror over descartian vortices you hover and perhaps at midday in the fairest weather with one halfthrottled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea no more to rise for ever heed it well ye pantheists chapter the quarterdeck _enter ahab then all_ it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast ahab as was his wont ascended the cabingangway to the deck there most seacaptains usually walk at that hour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns in the garden soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his old rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all over dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk did you fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also you would see still stranger footprintsthe footprints of his one unsleeping everpacing thought but on the occasion in question those dents looked deeper even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark and so full of his thought was ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the mainmast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement dye mark him flask whispered stubb the chick thats in him pecks the shell twill soon be out the hours wore onahab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect it drew near the close of day suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the augerhole there and with one hand grasping a shroud he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft sir said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given on shipboard except in some extraordinary case send everybody aft repeated ahab mastheads there come down when the entire ships company were assembled and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up ahab after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks and then darting his eyes among the crew started from his standpoint and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck with bent head and halfslouched hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till stubb cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat but this did not last long vehemently pausing he cried what do ye do when ye see a whale men sing out for him was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices good cried ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them and what do ye next men lower away and after him and what tune is it ye pull to men a dead whale or a stove boat more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew the countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions but they were all eagerness again as ahab now halfrevolving in his pivothole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus all ye mastheaders have before now heard me give orders about a white whale look ye dye see this spanish ounce of goldholding up a broad bright coin to the sunit is a sixteen dollar piece men dye see it mr starbuck hand me yon topmaul while the mate was getting the hammer ahab without speaking was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as if to heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him receiving the topmaul from starbuck he advanced towards the mainmast with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with the other and with a high raised voice exclaiming whosoever of ye raises me a whiteheaded whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of ye raises me that whiteheaded whale with three holes punctured in his starboard flukelook ye whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boys huzza huzza cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast its a white whale i say resumed ahab as he threw down the topmaul a white whale skin your eyes for him men look sharp for white water if ye see but a bubble sing out all this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection captain ahab said tashtego that white whale must be the same that some call moby dick moby dick shouted ahab do ye know the white whale then tash does he fantail a little curious sir before he goes down said the gayheader deliberately and has he a curious spout too said daggoo very bushy even for a parmacetty and mighty quick captain ahab and he have one two threeoh good many iron in him hide too captain cried queequeg disjointedly all twisketee betwisk like himhim faltering hard for a word and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottlelike himhim corkscrew cried ahab aye queequeg the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout is a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white as a pile of our nantucket wool after the great annual sheepshearing aye tashtego and he fantails like a split jib in a squall death and devils men it is moby dick ye have seenmoby dickmoby dick captain ahab said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder captain ahab i have heard of moby dickbut it was not moby dick that took off thy leg who told thee that cried ahab then pausing aye starbuck aye my hearties all round it was moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that brought me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye he shouted with a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heartstricken moose aye aye it was that accursed white whale that razeed me made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day then tossing both arms with measureless imprecations he shouted out aye aye and ill chase him round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and round perditions flames before i give him up and this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out what say ye men will ye splice hands on it now i think ye do look brave aye aye shouted the harpooneers and seamen running closer to the excited old man a sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for moby dick god bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout god bless ye men steward go draw the great measure of grog but whats this long face about mr starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not game for moby dick i am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of death too captain ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow but i came here to hunt whales not my commanders vengeance how many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it captain ahab it will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market nantucket market hoot but come closer starbuck thou requirest a little lower layer if moneys to be the measurer man and the accountants have computed their great countinghouse the globe by girdling it with guineas one to every three parts of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium _here_ he smites his chest whispered stubb whats that for methinks it rings most vast but hollow vengeance on a dumb brute cried starbuck that simply smote thee from blindest instinct madness to be enraged with a dumb thing captain ahab seems blasphemous hark ye yet againthe little lower layer all visible objects man are but as pasteboard masks but in each eventin the living act the undoubted deedthere some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask if man will strike strike through the mask how can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall to me the white whale is that wall shoved near to me sometimes i think theres naught beyond but tis enough he tasks me he heaps me i see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malice sinewing it that inscrutable thing is chiefly what i hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale principal i will wreak that hate upon him talk not to me of blasphemy man id strike the sun if it insulted me for could the sun do that then could i do the other since there is ever a sort of fair play herein jealousy presiding over all creations but not my master man is even that fair play whos over me truth hath no confines take off thine eye more intolerable than fiends glarings is a doltish stare so so thou reddenest and palest my heat has melted thee to angerglow but look ye starbuck what is said in heat that thing unsays itself there are men from whom warm words are small indignity i meant not to incense thee let it go look see yonder turkish cheeks of spotted tawnliving breathing pictures painted by the sun the pagan leopardsthe unrecking and unworshipping things that live and seek and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel the crew man the crew are they not one and all with ahab in this matter of the whale see stubb he laughs see yonder chilian he snorts to think of it stand up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling cannot starbuck and what is it reckon it tis but to help strike a fin no wondrous feat for starbuck what is it more from this one poor hunt then the best lance out of all nantucket surely he will not hang back when every foremasthand has clutched a whetstone ah constrainings seize thee i see the billow lifts thee speak but speakaye aye thy silence then _that_ voices thee _aside_ something shot from my dilated nostrils he has inhaled it in his lungs starbuck now is mine cannot oppose me now without rebellion god keep mekeep us all murmured starbuck lowly but in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from the hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts as for a moment their hearts sank in for again starbucks downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life the subterranean laugh died away the winds blew on the sails filled out the ship heaved and rolled as before ah ye admonitions and warnings why stay ye not when ye come but rather are ye predictions than warnings ye shadows yet not so much predictions from without as verifications of the foregoing things within for with little external to constrain us the innermost necessities in our being these still drive us on the measure the measure cried ahab receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneers he ordered them to produce their weapons then ranging them before him near the capstan with their harpoons in their hands while his three mates stood at his side with their lances and the rest of the ships company formed a circle round the group he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew but those wild eyes met his as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison but alas only to fall into the hidden snare of the indian drink and pass he cried handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman the crew alone now drink round with it round short draughtslong swallows men tis hot as satans hoof so so it goes round excellently it spiralizes in ye forks out at the serpentsnapping eye well done almost drained that way it went this way it comes hand it meheres a hollow men ye seem the years so brimming life is gulped and gone steward refill attend now my braves i have mustered ye all round this capstan and ye mates flank me with your lances and ye harpooneers stand there with your irons and ye stout mariners ring me in that i may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me o men you will yet see thatha boy come back bad pennies come not sooner hand it me why now this pewter had run brimming again wert not thou st vitus impaway thou ague advance ye mates cross your lances full before me well done let me touch the axis so saying with extended arm he grasped the three level radiating lances at their crossed centre while so doing suddenly and nervously twitched them meanwhile glancing intently from starbuck to stubb from stubb to flask it seemed as though by some nameless interior volition he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own magnetic life the three mates quailed before his strong sustained and mystic aspect stubb and flask looked sideways from him the honest eye of starbuck fell downright in vain cried ahab but maybe tis well for did ye three but once take the fullforced shock then mine own electric thing _that_ had perhaps expired from out me perchance too it would have dropped ye dead perchance ye need it not down lances and now ye mates i do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen thereyon three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen my valiant harpooneers disdain the task what when the great pope washes the feet of beggars using his tiara for ewer oh my sweet cardinals your own condescension _that_ shall bend ye to it i do not order ye ye will it cut your seizings and draw the poles ye harpooneers silently obeying the order the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons some three feet long held barbs up before him stab me not with that keen steel cant them cant

stronger i shouted and more did i hammer and clinch my oath because of the dread in my soul a wild mystical sympathetical feeling was in me ahabs quenchless feud seemed mine with greedy ears i learned the history of that murderous monster against whom i and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge for some time past though at intervals only the unaccompanied secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the sperm whale fishermen but not all of them knew of his existence only a few of them comparatively had knowingly seen him while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him was small indeed for owing to the large number of whalecruisers the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch to encounter a single newstelling sail of any sort the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the times of sailing from home all these with other circumstances direct and indirect long obstructed the spread through the whole worldwide whalingfleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby dick it was hardly to be doubted that several vessels reported to have encountered at such or such a time or on such or such a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after doing great mischief to his assailants had completely escaped them to some minds it was not an unfair presumption i say that the whale in question must have been no other than moby dick yet as of late the sperm whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity cunning and malice in the monster attacked therefore it was that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick such hunters perhaps for the most part were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred more as it were to the perils of the sperm whale fishery at large than to the individual cause in that way mostly the disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded and as for those who previously hearing of the white whale by chance caught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them almost as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him as for any other whale of that species but at length such calamities did ensue in these assaultsnot restricted to sprained wrists and ankles broken limbs or devouring amputationsbut fatal to the last degree of fatality those repeated disastrous repulses all accumulating and piling their terrors upon moby dick those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters for not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible eventsas the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi but in maritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumors abound wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to and as the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there for not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors but of all sailors they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels but hand to jaw give battle to them alone in such remotest waters that though you sailed a thousand miles and passed a thousand shores you would not come to any chiseled hearthstone or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun in such latitudes and longitudes pursuing too such a calling as he does the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth no wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the white whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints and halfformed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies which eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears so that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the white whale few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work not even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm whale as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body there are those this day among them who though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale would perhapseither from professional inexperience or incompetency or timidity decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there are plenty of whalemen especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the american flag who have never hostilely encountered the sperm whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north seated on their hatches these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe to the wild strange tales of southern whaling nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prows which stem him and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it we find some book naturalistsolassen and povelsondeclaring the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood nor even down to so late a time as cuviers were these or almost similar impressions effaced for in his natural history the baron himself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale all fish sharks included are struck with the most lively terrors and often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death and however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these yet in their full terribleness even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson the superstitious belief in them is in some vicissitudes of their vocation revived in the minds of the hunters so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him not a few of the fishermen recalled in reference to moby dick the earlier days of the sperm whale fishery when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the sperm whale was not for mortal man that to attempt it would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity on this head there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted nevertheless some there were who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to moby dick and a still greater number who chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without the specific details of any certain calamity and without superstitious accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered one of the wild suggestions referred to as at last coming to be linked with the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time nor credulous as such minds must have been was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability for as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged even to the most erudite research so the hidden ways of the sperm whale when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to his pursuers and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them especially concerning the mystic modes whereby after sounding to a great depth he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points it is a thing well known to both american and english whaleships and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby that some whales have been captured far north in the pacific in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland seas nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days hence by inference it has been believed by some whalemen that the nor west passage so long a problem to man was never a problem to the whale so that here in the real living experience of living men the prodigies related in old times of the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse whose waters were believed to have come from the holy land by an underground passage these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen forced into familiarity then with such prodigies as these and knowing that after repeated intrepid assaults the white whale had escaped alive it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions declaring moby dick not only ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is but ubiquity in time that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks he would still swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away his unsullied jet would once more be seen but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power for it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales but as was elsewhere thrown outa peculiar snowwhite wrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump these were his prominent features the tokens whereby even in the limitless uncharted seas he revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him the rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea leaving a milkyway wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden gleamings nor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet his deformed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural terror as that unexampled intelligent malignity which according to specific accounts he had over and over again evinced in his assaults more than all his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else for when swimming before his exulting pursuers with every apparent symptom of alarm he had several times been known to turn round suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave their boats to splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ship already several fatalities had attended his chase but though similar disasters however little bruited ashore were by no means unusual in the fishery yet in most instances such seemed the white whales infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death that he caused was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent judge then to what pitches of inflamed distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips of chewed boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of the white curds of the whales direful wrath into the serene exasperating sunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridal his three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling in the eddies one captain seizing the lineknife from his broken prow had dashed at the whale as an arkansas duellist at his foe blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathomdeep life of the whale that captain was ahab and then it was that suddenly sweeping his sickleshaped lower jaw beneath him moby dick had reaped away ahabs leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field no turbaned turk no hired venetian or malay could have smote him with more seeming malice small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woes but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations the white whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung that intangible malignity which has been from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe onehalf of the worlds which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devilahab did not fall down and worship it like them but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it all that most maddens and torments all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with malice in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain all the subtle demonisms of life and thought all evil to crazy ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in moby dick he piled upon the whales white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down and then as if his chest had been a mortar he burst his hot hearts shell upon it it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment then in darting at the monster knife in hand he had but given loose to a sudden passionate corporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more yet when by this collision forced to turn towards home and for long months of days and weeks ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling patagonian cape then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another and so interfusing made him mad that it was only then on the homeward voyage after the encounter that the final monomania seized him seems all but certain from the fact that at intervals during the passage he was a raving lunatic and though unlimbed of a leg yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest and was moreover intensified by his delirium that his mates were forced to lace him fast even there as he sailed raving in his hammock in a straitjacket he swung to the mad rockings of the gales and when running into more sufferable latitudes the ship with mild stunsails spread floated across the tranquil tropics and to all appearances the old mans delirium seemed left behind him with the cape horn swells and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air even then when he bore that firm collected front however pale and issued his calm orders once again and his mates thanked god the direful madness was now gone even then ahab in his hidden self raved on human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing when you think it fled it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form ahabs full lunacy subsided not but deepeningly contracted like the unabated hudson when that noble northman flows narrowly but unfathomably through the highland gorge but as in his narrowflowing monomania not one jot of ahabs broad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished that before living agent now became the living instrument if such a furious trope may stand his special lunacy stormed his general sanity and carried it and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that far from having lost his strength ahab to that one end did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object this is much yet ahabs larger darker deeper part remains unhinted but vain to popularize profundities and all truth is profound winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where we here standhowever grand and wonderful now quit itand take your way ye nobler sadder souls to those vast roman halls of thermes where far beneath the fantastic towers of mans upper earth his root of grandeur his whole awful essence sits in bearded state an antique buried beneath antiquities and throned on torsoes so with a broken throne the great gods mock that captive king so like a caryatid he patient sits upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages wind ye down there ye prouder sadder souls question that proud sad king a family likeness aye he did beget ye ye young exiled royalties and from your grim sire only will the old statesecret come now in his heart ahab had some glimpse of this namely all my means are sane my motive and my object mad yet without power to kill or change or shun the fact he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble in some sort did still but that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility not to his will determinate nevertheless so well did he succeed in that dissembling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause and so too all the added moodiness which always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the present voyage sat brooding on his brow nor is it so very unlikely that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage on account of such dark symptoms the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales gnawed within and scorched without with the infixed unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes or if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack but be all this as it may certain it is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and allengrossing object of hunting the white whale had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man they were bent on profitable cruises the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint he was intent on an audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge here then was this greyheaded ungodly old man chasing with curses a jobs whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly made up of mongrel renegades and castaways and cannibalsmorally enfeebled also by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or rightmindedness in starbuck the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in stubb and the pervading mediocrity in flask such a crew so officered seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge how it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old mans ireby what evil magic their souls were possessed that at times his hate seemed almost theirs the white whale as much their insufferable foe as his how all this came to bewhat the white whale was to them or how to their unconscious understandings also in some dim unsuspected way he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of lifeall this to explain would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go the subterranean miner that works in us all how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting muffled sound of his pick who does not feel the irresistible arm drag what skiff in tow of a seventyfour can stand still for one i gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all arush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill chapter the whiteness of the whale what the white whale was to ahab has been hinted what at times he was to me as yet remains unsaid aside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick which could not but occasionally awaken in any mans soul some alarm there was another thought or rather vague nameless horror concerning him which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it that i almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form it was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me but how can i hope to explain myself here and yet in some dim random way explain myself i must else all these chapters might be naught though in many natural objects whiteness refiningly enhances beauty as if imparting some special virtue of its own as in marbles japonicas and pearls and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old kings of pegu placing the title lord of the white elephants above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion and the modern kings of siam unfurling the same snowwhite quadruped in the royal standard and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snowwhite charger and the great austrian empire cæsarian heir to overlording rome having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue and though this preeminence in it applies to the human race itself giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all this whiteness has been even made significant of gladness for among the romans a white stone marked a joyful day and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings this same hue is made the emblem of many touching noble thingsthe innocence of brides the benignity of age though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor though in many climes whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milkwhite steeds though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power by the persian fire worshippers the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar and in the greek mythologies great jove himself being made incarnate in a snowwhite bull and though to the noble iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology that spotless faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity and though directly from the latin word for white all christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture the alb or tunic worn beneath the cassock and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith white is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord though in the vision of st john white robes are given to the redeemed and the fourandtwenty elders stand clothed in white before the great white throne and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool yet for all these accumulated associations with whatever is sweet and honorable and sublime there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood this elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whiteness when divorced from more kindly associations and coupled with any object terrible in itself to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds witness the white bear of the poles and the white shark of the tropics what but their smooth flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb gloating of their aspect so that not the fiercefanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the whiteshrouded bear or shark with reference to the polar bear it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not the whiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened hideousness it might be said only rises from the circumstance that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds the polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast but even assuming all this to be true yet were it not for the whiteness you would not have that intensified terror as for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallies with the same quality in the polar quadruped this peculiarity is most vividly hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish the romish mass for the dead begins with requiem eternam eternal rest whence _requiem_ denominating the mass itself and any other funeral music now in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark and the mild deadliness of his habits the french call him _requin_ bethink thee of the albatross whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations not coleridge first threw that spell but gods great unflattering laureate nature i remember the first albatross i ever saw it was during a prolonged gale in waters hard upon the antarctic seas from my forenoon watch below i ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the main hatches i saw a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and with a hooked roman bill sublime at intervals it arched forth its vast archangel wings as if to embrace some holy ark wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it though bodily unharmed it uttered cries as some kings ghost in supernatural distress through its inexpressible strange eyes methought i peeped to secrets which took hold of god as abraham before the angels i bowed myself the white thing was so white its wings so wide and in those for ever exiled waters i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage i cannot tell can only hint the things that darted through me then but at last i awoke and turning asked a sailor what bird was this a goney he replied goney never had heard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore never but some time after i learned that goney was some seamans name for albatross so that by no possibility could coleridges wild rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine when i saw that bird upon our deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor knew the bird to be an albatross yet in saying this i do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet i assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced in this that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses and these i have frequently seen but never with such emotions as when i beheld the antarctic fowl but how had the mystic thing been caught whisper it not and i will tell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowl floated on the sea at last the captain made a postman of it tying a lettered leathern tally round its neck with the ships time and place and then letting it escape but i doubt not that leathern tally meant for man was taken off in heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wingfolding the invoking and adoring cherubim most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that of the white steed of the prairies a magnificent milkwhite charger largeeyed smallheaded bluffchested and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty overscorning carriage he was the elected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies at their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light the flashing cascade of his mane the curving comet of his tail invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silverbeaters could have furnished him a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western world which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god bluffbrowed and fearless as this mighty steed whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains like an ohio or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon the white steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness in whatever aspect he presented himself always to the bravest indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly which so clothed him with divineness and that this divineness had that in it which though commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror but there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed and albatross what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin it is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the name he bears the albino is as well made as other menhas no substantive deformityand yet this mere aspect of allpervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion why should this be so nor in quite other aspects does nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible from its snowy aspect the gauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the white squall nor in some historic instances has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary how wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their faction the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the marketplace nor in some things does the common hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue it cannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingering there as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here and from that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts rising in a milkwhite fogyea while these terrors seize us let us add that even the king of terrors when personified by the evangelist rides on his pallid horse therefore in his other moods symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul but though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortal man to account for it to analyse it would seem impossible can we then by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whitenessthough for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful but nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorcery however modifiedcan we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek let us try but in a matter like this subtlety appeals to subtlety and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls and though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time and therefore may not be able to recall them now why to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day does the bare mention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless processions of slowpacing pilgrims downcast and hooded with newfallen snow or to the unread unsophisticated protestant of the middle american states why does the passing mention of a white friar or a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings which will not wholly account for it that makes the white tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled american than those other storied structures its neighborsthe byward tower or even the bloody and those sublimer towers the white mountains of new hampshire whence in peculiar moods comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name while the thought of virginias blue ridge is full of a soft dewy distant dreaminess or why irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes does the name of the white sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets or to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed to the fancy why in reading the old fairy tales of central europe does the tall pale man of the hartz forests whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groveswhy is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the blocksburg nor is it altogether the remembrance of her cathedraltoppling earthquakes nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires wrenched copestones and crosses all adroop like canted yards of anchored fleets and her suburban avenues of housewalls lying over upon each other as a tossed pack of cardsit is not these things alone which make tearless lima the strangest saddest city thou canst see for lima has taken the white veil and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe old as pizarro this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions i know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality what i mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples first the mariner when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands if by night he hear the roar of breakers starts to vigilance and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties but under precisely similar circumstances let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whitenessas if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him then he feels a silent superstitious dread the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings heart and helm they both go down he never rests till blue water is under him again yet where is the mariner who will tell thee sir it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me second to the native indian of peru the continual sight of the snowhowdahed andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the west who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness not so the sailor beholding the scenery of the antarctic seas where at times by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air he shivering and half shipwrecked instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses but thou sayest methinks that whitelead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a hypo ishmael tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of vermont far removed from all beasts of preywhy is it that upon the sunniest day if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that he cannot even see it but only smells its wild animal muskinesswhy will he start snort and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright there is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils for what knows he this new england colt of the black bisons of distant oregon no but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world though thousands of miles from oregon still when he smells that savage musk the rending goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies which this instant they may be trampling into dust thus then the muffled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies all these to ishmael are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints yet with me as with the colt somewhere those things must exist though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love the invisible spheres were formed in fright but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul and more strange and far more portentouswhy as we have seen it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things nay the very veil of the christians deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of the milky way or is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all colours is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness full of meaning in a wide landscape of snowsa colourless allcolour of atheism from which we shrink and when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers that all other earthly huesevery stately or lovely emblazoningthe sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods yea and the gilded velvets of butterflies and the butterfly cheeks of young girls all these are but subtile deceits not actually inherent in substances but only laid on from without so that all deified nature absolutely paints like the harlot whose allurements cover nothing but the charnelhouse within and when we proceed further and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues the great principle of light for ever remains white or colorless in itself and if operating without medium upon matter would touch all objects even tulips and roses with its own blank tingepondering all this the palsied universe lies before us a leper and like wilful travellers in lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him and of all these things the albino whale was the symbol wonder ye then at the fiery hunt chapter hark hist did you hear that noise cabaco it was the middlewatch a fair moonlight the seamen were standing in a cordon extending from one of the freshwater butts in the waist to the scuttlebutt near the taffrail in this manner they passed the buckets to fill the scuttlebutt standing for the most part on the hallowed precincts of the quarterdeck they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet from hand to hand the buckets went in the deepest silence only broken by the occasional flap of a sail and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel it was in the midst of this repose that archy one of the cordon whose post was near the afterhatches whispered to his neighbor a cholo the words above hist did you hear that

well see what turns up hark ye cabaco there is somebody down in the afterhold that has not yet been seen on deck and i suspect our old mogul knows something of it too i heard stubb tell flask one morning watch that there was something of that sort in the wind tish the bucket chapter the chart had you followed captain ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts spread them before him on his screweddown table then seating himself before it you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank at intervals he would refer to piles of old logbooks beside him wherein were set down the seasons and places in which on various former voyages of various ships sperm whales had been captured or seen while thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead but it was not this night in particular that in the solitude of his cabin ahab thus pondered over his charts almost every night they were brought out almost every night some pencil marks were effaced and others were substituted for with the charts of all four oceans before him ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul now to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet but not so did it seem to ahab who knew the sets of all tides and currents and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whales food and also calling to mind the regular ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes could arrive at reasonable surmises almost approaching to certainties concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey so assured indeed is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whales resorting to given waters that many hunters believe that could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herringshoals or the flights of swallows on this hint attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale since the above was written the statement is happily borne out by an official circular issued by lieutenant maury of the national observatory washington april th by that circular it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion and portions of it are presented in the circular this chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district and the two others to show the number of days in which whales sperm or right have been seen besides when making a passage from one feedingground to another the sperm whales guided by some infallible instinctsay rather secret intelligence from the deitymostly swim in _veins_ as they are called continuing their way along a given oceanline with such undeviating exactitude that no ship ever sailed her course by any chart with one tithe of such marvellous precision though in these cases the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyors parallel and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary _vein_ in which at these times he is said to swim generally embraces some few miles in width more or less as the vein is presumed to expand or contract but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whaleships mastheads when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone the sum is that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for and hence not only at substantiated times upon well known separate feedinggrounds could ahab hope to encounter his prey but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could by his art so place and time himself on his way as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting there was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme but not so in the reality perhaps though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year say will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true in general the same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales so that though moby dick had in a former year been seen for example on what is called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on the japanese coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly encounter him there so too with some other feeding grounds where he had at times revealed himself but all these seemed only his casual stoppingplaces and oceaninns so to speak not his places of prolonged abode and where ahabs chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of allusion has only been made to whatever wayside antecedent extra prospects were his ere a particular set time or place were attained when all possibilities would become probabilities and as ahab fondly thought every possibility the next thing to a certainty that particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrasethe seasonontheline for there and then for several consecutive years moby dick had been periodically descried lingering in those waters for awhile as the sun in its annual round loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the zodiac there it was too that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place there the waves were storied with his deeds there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned however flattering it might be to those hopes nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest now the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of the seasonontheline no possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards double cape horn and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time to cruise there therefore he must wait for the next ensuing season yet the premature hour of the pequods sailing had perhaps been correctly selected by ahab with a view to this very complexion of things because an interval of three hundred and sixtyfive days and nights was before him an interval which instead of impatiently enduring ashore he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt if by chance the white whale spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feedinggrounds should turn up his wrinkled brow off the persian gulf or in the bengal bay or china seas or in any other waters haunted by his race so that monsoons pampas norwesters harmattans trades any wind but the levanter and simoon might blow moby dick into the devious zigzag worldcircle of the pequods circumnavigating wake but granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even as a whitebearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople yes for the peculiar snowwhite brow of moby dick and his snowwhite hump could not but be unmistakable and have i not tallied the whale ahab would mutter to himself as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveriestallied him and shall he escape his broad fins are bored and scalloped out like a lost sheeps ear and here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength ah god what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire he sleeps with clenched hands and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms often when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night which resuming his own intense thoughts through the day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbing of his lifespot became insufferable anguish and when as was sometimes the case these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base and a chasm seemed opening in him from which forked flames and lightnings shot up and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them when this hell in himself yawned beneath him a wild cry would be heard through the ship and with glaring eyes ahab would burst from his state room as though escaping from a bed that was on fire yet these perhaps instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness or fright at his own resolve were but the plainest tokens of its intensity for at such times crazy ahab the scheming unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahab that had gone to his hammock was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again the latter was the eternal living principle or soul in him and in sleep being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time it was no longer an integral but as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul therefore it must have been that in ahabs case yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose that purpose by its own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of selfassumed independent being of its own nay could grimly live and burn while the common vitality to which it was conjoined fled horrorstricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes when what seemed ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be sure but without an object to colour and therefore a blankness in itself god help thee old man thy thoughts have created a creature in thee and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a prometheus a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever that vulture the very creature he creates chapter the affidavit so far as what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeed as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales the foregoing chapter in its earlier part is as important a one as will be found in this volume but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon in order to be adequately understood and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair i care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman and from these citations i take itthe conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself first i have personally known three instances where a whale after receiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and after an interval in one instance of three years has been again struck by the same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same private cypher have been taken from the body in the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons and i think it may have been something more than that the man who darted them happening in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage to africa went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated far into the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two years often endangered by serpents savages tigers poisonous miasmas with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions meanwhile the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe brushing with its flanks all the coasts of africa but to no purpose this man and this whale again came together and the one vanquished the other i say i myself have known three instances similar to this that is in two of them i saw the whales struck and upon the second attack saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them afterwards taken from the dead fish in the threeyear instance it so fell out that i was in the boat both times first and last and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whales eye which i had observed there three years previous i say three years but i am pretty sure it was more than that here are three instances then which i personally know the truth of but i have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach secondly it is well known in the sperm whale fishery however ignorant the world ashore may be of it that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil no the reason was this that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street lest if they pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for their presumption but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebritynay you may call it an oceanwide renown not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death but he was admitted into all the rights privileges and distinctions of a name had as much a name indeed as cambyses or cæsar was it not so o timor tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long didst lurk in the oriental straits of that name whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of ombay was it not so o new zealand jack thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the tattoo land was it not so o morquan king of japan whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snowwhite cross against the sky was it not so o don miguel thou chilian whale marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back in plain prose here are four whales as well known to the students of cetacean history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar but this is not all new zealand tom and don miguel after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels were finally gone in quest of systematically hunted out chased and killed by valiant whaling captains who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view as in setting out through the narragansett woods captain butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior of the indian king philip i do not know where i can find a better place than just here to make mention of one or two other things which to me seem important as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe for this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error so ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world that without some hints touching the plain facts historical and otherwise of the fishery they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable or still worse and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory first though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vivid conception of those perils and the frequency with which they recur one reason perhaps is that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery ever finds a public record at home however transient and immediately forgotten that record do you suppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by the whaleline off the coast of new guinea is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathando you suppose that that poor fellows name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read tomorrow at your breakfast no because the mails are very irregular between here and new guinea in fact did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea yet i tell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific among many others we spoke thirty different ships every one of which had had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each lost a boats crew for gods sake be economical with your lamps and candles not a gallon you burn but at least one drop of mans blood was spilled for it secondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power but i have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this twofold enormousness they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness when i declare upon my soul i had no more idea of being facetious than moses when he wrote the history of the plagues of egypt but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own that point is this the sperm whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously malicious as with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and sink a large ship and what is more the sperm whale _has_ done it first in the year the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket was cruising in the pacific ocean one day she saw spouts lowered her boats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales ere long several of the whales were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escaping from the boats issued from the shoal and bore directly down upon the ship dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove her in that in less than ten minutes she settled down and fell over not a surviving plank of her has been seen since after the severest exposure part of the crew reached the land in their boats being returned home at last captain pollard once more sailed for the pacific in command of another ship but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers for the second time his ship was utterly lost and forthwith forswearing the sea he has never tempted it since at this day captain pollard is a resident of nantucket i have seen owen chace who was chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy i have read his plain and faithful narrative i have conversed with his son and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe the following are extracts from chaces narrative every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations he made two several attacks upon the ship at a short interval between them both of which according to their direction were calculated to do us the most injury by being made ahead and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock to effect which the exact manœuvres which he made were necessary his aspect was most horrible and such as indicated resentment and fury he came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered and in which we had struck three of his companions as if fired with revenge for their sufferings again at all events the whole circumstances taken together all happening before my own eyes and producing at the time impressions in my mind of decided calculating mischief on the part of the whale many of which impressions i cannot now recall induce me to be satisfied that i am correct in my opinion here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship during a black night in an open boat when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed upon hidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moments thought the dismal looking wreck and _the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale_ wholly engrossed my reflections until day again made its appearance in another placep he speaks of _the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal_ secondly the ship union also of nantucket was in the year totally lost off the azores by a similar onset but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter though from the whale hunters i have now and then heard casual allusions to it thirdly some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j then commanding an american sloopofwar of the first class happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains on board a nantucket ship in the harbor of oahu sandwich islands conversation turning upon whales the commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present he peremptorily denied for example that any whale could so smite his stout sloopofwar as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful very good but there is more coming some weeks after the commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for valparaiso but he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale that begged a few moments confidential business with him that business consisted in fetching the commodores craft such a thwack that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair i am not superstitious but i consider the commodores interview with that whale as providential was not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright i tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsense i will now refer you to langsdorffs voyages for a little circumstance in point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof langsdorff you must know by the way was attached to the russian admiral krusensterns famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail and the next day we were out in the open sea on our way to ochotsh the weather was very clear and fine but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing for some days we had very little wind it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up an uncommon large whale the body of which was larger than the ship itself lay almost at the surface of the water but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship which was in full sail was almost upon him so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him we were thus placed in the most imminent danger as this gigantic creature setting up its back raised the ship three feet at least out of the water the masts reeled and the sails fell altogether while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struck upon some rock instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity captain dwolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured now the captain dwolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question is a new englander who after a long life of unusual adventures as a seacaptain this day resides in the village of dorchester near boston i have the honor of being a nephew of his i have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorff he substantiates every word the ship however was by no means a large one a russian craft built on the siberian coast and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home in that up and down manly book of oldfashioned adventure so full too of honest wondersthe voyage of lionel wafer one of ancient dampiers old chumsi found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from langsdorff that i cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example if such be needed lionel it seems was on his way to john ferdinando as he calls the modern juan fernandes in our way thither he says about four oclock in the morning when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the main of america our ship felt a terrible shock which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think but every one began to prepare for death and indeed the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement was a little over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground the suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks captain davis who lay with his head on a gun was thrown out of his cabin lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake somewhere about that time did actually do great mischief along the spanish land but i should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath i might proceed with several more examples one way or another known to me of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale in more than one instance he has been known not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships but to pursue the ship itself and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head and as for his strength let me say that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and secured there the whale towing her great hull through the water as a horse walks off with a cart again it is very often observed that if the sperm whale once struck is allowed time to rally he then acts not so often with blind rage as with wilful deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes but i must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration a remarkable and most significant one by which you will not fail to see that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day but that these marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomonverily there is nothing new under the sun in the sixth christian century lived procopius a christian magistrate of constantinople in the days when justinian was emperor and belisarius general as many know he wrote the history of his own times a work every way of uncommon value by the best authorities he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in some one or two particulars not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned now in this history of his procopius mentions that during the term of his prefecture at constantinople a great seamonster was captured in the neighboring propontis or sea of marmora after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid nor is there any reason it should be of what precise species this seamonster was is not mentioned but as he destroyed ships as well as for other reasons he must have been a whale and i am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale and i will tell you why for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it even now i am certain that those seas are not and perhaps never can be in the present constitution of things a place for his habitual gregarious resort but further investigations have recently proved to me that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good authority that on the barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale now as a vessel of war readily passes through the dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis in the propontis as far as i can learn none of that peculiar substance called _brit_ is to be found the aliment of the right whale but i have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whalesquid or cuttlefishlurks at the bottom of that sea because large creatures but by no means the largest of that sort have been found at its surface if then you properly put these statements together and reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that according to all human reasoning procopiuss seamonster that for half a century stove the ships of a roman emperor must in all probability have been a sperm whale chapter surmises though consumed with the hot fire of his purpose ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby dick though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whalemans ways altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage or at least if this were otherwise there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him it would be refining too much perhaps even considering his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards the white whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted but if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable there were still additional considerations which though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion yet were by no means incapable of swaying him to accomplish his object ahab must use tools and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order he knew for example that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation starbucks body and starbucks coerced will were ahabs so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbucks brain still he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred his captains quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from it or even frustrate it it might be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whale was seen during that long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captains leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him not only that but the subtle insanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that for the present the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background for few mens courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action that when they stood their long night watches his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than moby dick for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliablethey live in the varying outer weather and they inhale its ficklenessand when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in the end it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash nor was ahab unmindful of another thing in times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations but such times are evanescent the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought ahab is sordidness granting that the white whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knighterrantism in them still while for the love of it they give chase to moby dick they must also have food for their more common daily appetites for even the high lifted and chivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre without committing burglaries picking pockets and gaining other pious perquisites by the way had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic objectthat final and romantic object too many would have turned from in disgust i will not strip these men thought ahab of all hopes of cashaye cash they may scorn cash now but let some months go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon cashier ahab nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally having impulsively it is probable and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the pequods voyage ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crew if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further obedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command from even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself that protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand backed by a heedful closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to for all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the pequods voyage observe all customary usages and not only that but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession be all this as it may his voice was now often heard hailing the three mastheads and admonishing them to keep a bright lookout and not omit reporting even a porpoise this vigilance was not long without reward chapter the matmaker it was a cloudy sultry afternoon the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks or vacantly gazing over into the leadcoloured waters queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a swordmat for an additional lashing to our boat so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self i was the attendant or page of queequeg while busy at the mat as i kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp using my own hand for the shuttle and as queequeg standing sideways ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads and idly looking off upon the water carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn i say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword that it seemed as if this were the loom of time and i myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the fates there lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single ever returning unchanging vibration and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own this warp seemed necessity and here thought i with my own hand i ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads meantime queequegs impulsive indifferent sword sometimes hitting the woof slantingly or crookedly or strongly or weakly as the case might be and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric this savages sword thought i which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof this easy indifferent sword must be chanceaye chance free will and necessitynowise incompatibleall interweavingly working together the straight warp of necessity not to be swerved from its ultimate courseits every alternating vibration indeed only tending to that free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads and chance though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity and sideways in its motions directed by free will though thus prescribed to by both chance by turns rules either and has the last featuring blow at events thus we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a sound so strange long drawn and musically wild and unearthly that the ball of free will dropped from my hand and i stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing high aloft in the crosstrees was that mad gayheader tashtego his body was reaching eagerly forward his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries to be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas from hundreds of whalemens lookouts perched as high in the air but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from tashtego the indians as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate and by those wild cries announcing their coming there she blows there there there she blows she blows whereaway on the leebeam about two miles off a school of them instantly all was commotion the sperm whale blows as a clock ticks with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity and thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus there go flukes was now the cry from tashtego and the whales disappeared quick steward cried ahab time time doughboy hurried below glanced at the watch and reported the exact minute to ahab the ship was now kept away from the wind and she went gently rolling before it tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale when sounding with his head in one direction he nevertheless while concealed beneath the surface mills round and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarterthis deceitfulness of his could not now be in action for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by tashtego had been in any way alarmed or indeed knew at all of our vicinity one of the men selected for shipkeepersthat is those not appointed to the boats by this time relieved the indian at the mainmast head the sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down the line tubs were fixed in their places the cranes were thrust out the mainyard was backed and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale so look the long line of manofwars men about to throw themselves on board an enemys ship but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale with a start all glared at dark ahab who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air chapter the first lowering the phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the other side of the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there this boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats though technically called the captains on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter the figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steellike lips a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff but strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head less swart in aspect the companions of this figure were of that vivid tigeryellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the manillasa race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil their lord whose countingroom they suppose to be elsewhere while yet the wondering ships company were gazing upon these strangers ahab cried out to the whiteturbaned old man at their head all ready there fedallah ready was the halfhissed reply lower away then dye hear shouting across the deck lower away there i say such was the thunder of his voice that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blocks with a wallow the three boats dropped into the sea while with a dexterous offhanded daring unknown in any other vocation the sailors goatlike leaped down the rolling ships side into the tossed boats below hardly had they pulled out from under the ships lee when a fourth keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and showed the five strangers rowing ahab who standing erect in the stern loudly hailed starbuck stubb and flask to spread themselves widely so as to cover a large expanse of water but with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command captain ahab said starbuck spread yourselves cried ahab give way all four boats thou flask pull out more to leeward aye aye sir cheerily cried little kingpost sweeping round his great steering oar lay back addressing his crew theretherethere again there she blows right ahead boyslay back never heed yonder yellow boys archy oh i dont mind em sir said archy i knew it all before now didnt i hear em in the hold and didnt i tell cabaco here of it what say ye cabaco they are stowaways mr flask pull pull my fine heartsalive pull my children pull my little ones drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb to his crew some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness why dont you break your backbones my boys what is it you stare at those chaps in yonder boat tut they are only five more hands come to help usnever mind from wherethe more the merrier pull then do pull never mind the brimstonedevils are good fellows enough so so there you are now thats the stroke for a thousand pounds thats the stroke to sweep the stakes hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil my heroes three cheers menall hearts alive easy easy dont be in a hurrydont be in a hurry why dont you snap your oars you rascals bite something you dogs so so so thensoftly softly thats itthats it long and strong give way there give way the devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallions ye are all asleep stop snoring ye sleepers and pull pull will ye pull cant ye pull wont ye why in the name of gudgeons and gingercakes dont ye pullpull and break something pull and start your eyes out here whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle every mothers son of ye draw his knife and pull with the blade between his teeth thats itthats it now ye do something that looks like it my steelbits start herstart her my silverspoons start her marlingspikes stubbs exordium to his crew is given here at large because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing but you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation not at all and therein consisted his chief peculiarity he would say the most terrific things to his crew in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself so loungingly managed his steeringoar and so broadly gapedopenmouthed at timesthat the mere sight of such a yawning commander by sheer force of contrast acted like a charm upon the crew then again stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them in obedience to a sign from ahab starbuck was now pulling obliquely across stubbs bow and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other stubb hailed the mate mr starbuck larboard boat there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye please halloa returned starbuck turning round not a single inch as he spoke still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew his face set like a flint from stubbs what think ye of those yellow boys sir smuggled on board somehow before the ship sailed strong strong boys in a whisper to his crew then speaking out loud again a sad business mr stubb seethe her seethe her my lads but never mind mr stubb all for the best let all your crew pull strong come what will spring my men spring theres hogsheads of sperm ahead mr stubb and thats what ye came for pull my boys sperm sperms the play this at least is duty duty and profit hand in hand aye aye i thought as much soliloquized stubb when the boats diverged as soon as i clapt eye on em i thought so aye and thats what he went into the after hold for so often as doughboy long suspected they were hidden down there the white whales at the bottom of it well well so be it cant be helped all right give way men it aint the white whale today give way now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ships company but archys fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them though indeed not credited then this had in some small measure prepared them for the event it took off the extreme edge of their wonder and so what with all this and stubbs confident way of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark ahabs precise agency in the matter from the beginning for me i silently recalled the mysterious shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the dim nantucket dawn as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable elijah meantime ahab out of hearing of his officers having sided the furthest to windward was still ranging ahead of the other boats a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five triphammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer as for fedallah who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like a fencers thrown half backward into the air as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him all at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed while the boats five oars were seen simultaneously peaked boat and crew sat motionless on the sea instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way the whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it every man look out along his oars cried starbuck thou queequeg stand up nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow the savage stood erect there and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea not very far distant flasks boat was also lying breathlessly still its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform it is used for catching turns with the whale line its top is not more spacious than the palm of a mans hand and standing upon such a base as that flask seemed perched at the masthead of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks but little kingpost was small and short and at the same time little kingpost was full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead standpoint of his did by no means satisfy kingpost i cant see three seas off tip us up an oar there and let me on to that upon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way swiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal good a masthead as any sir will you mount that i will and thank ye very much my fine fellow only i wish you fifty feet taller whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his flat palm to flasks foot and then putting flasks hand on his hearseplumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders and here was flask now standing daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and crossrunning seas still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstances but the sight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more curious for sustaining himself with a cool indifferent easy unthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form on his broad back flaxenhaired flask seemed a snowflake the bearer looked nobler than the rider though truly vivacious tumultuous ostentatious little flask would now and then stamp with impatience but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negros lordly chest so have i seen passion and vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that meanwhile stubb the third mate betrayed no such fargazing solicitudes the whales might have made one of their regular soundings not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that were the case stubb as his wont in such cases it seems was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe he withdrew it from his hatband where he always wore it aslant like a feather he loaded it and rammed home the loading with his thumbend but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand when tashtego his harpooneer whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry down down all and give waythere they are to a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have been visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it and suffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from white rolling billows the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled as it were like the air over intensely heated plates of iron beneath this atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of water also the whales were swimming seen in advance of all the other indications the puffs of vapor they spouted seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders all four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air but it bade fair to outstrip them it flew on and on as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills pull pull my good boys said starbuck in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses he did not say much to his crew though nor did his crew say anything to him only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers now harsh with command now soft with entreaty how different the loud little kingpost sing out and say something my hearties roar and pull my thunderbolts beach me beach me on their black backs boys only do that for me and ill sign over to you my marthas vineyard plantation boys including wife and children boys lay me onlay me on o lord lord but i shall go stark staring mad see see that white water and so shouting he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted it far off upon the sea and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boats stern like a crazed colt from the prairie look at that chap now philosophically drawled stubb who with his unlighted short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at a short distance followed afterhes got fits that flask has fits yes give him fitsthats the very wordpitch fits into em merrily merrily heartsalive pudding for supper you knowmerrys the word pull babespull sucklingspull all but what the devil are you hurrying about softly softly and steadily my men only pull and keep pulling nothing more crack all your backbones and bite your knives in twothats all take it easywhy dont ye take it easy i say and burst all your livers and lungs but what it was that inscrutable ahab said to that tigeryellow crew of histhese were words best omitted here for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words when with tornado brow and eyes of red murder and foamglued lips ahab leaped after his prey meanwhile all the boats tore on the repeated specific allusions of flask to that whale as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boats bow with its tailthese allusions of his were at times so vivid and lifelike that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder but this was against all rule for the oarsmen must put out their eyes and ram a skewer through their necks usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears and no limbs but arms in these critical moments it was a sight full of quick wonder and awe the vast swells of the omnipotent sea the surging hollow roar they made as they rolled along the eight gunwales like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowlinggreen the brief suspended agony of the boat as it would tip for an instant on the knifelike edge of the sharper waves that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill the headlong sledlike slide down its other sideall these with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails like a wild hen after her screaming broodall this was thrilling not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle not the dead mans ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other worldneither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed churned circle of the hunted sperm whale the dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloudshadows flung upon the sea the jets of vapor no longer blended but tilted everywhere to right and left the whales seemed separating their wakes the boats were pulled more apart starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward our sail was now set and with the still rising wind we rushed along the boat going with such madness through the water that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the rowlocks soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist neither ship nor boat to be seen give way men whispered starbuck drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes theres white water againclose to spring soon after two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast but hardly were they overheard when with a lightninglike hurtling whisper starbuck said stand up and queequeg harpoon in hand sprang to his feet though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the imminent instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents thats his hump _there_ _there_ give it to him whispered starbuck a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it was the darted iron of queequeg then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge the sail collapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us the whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helterskelter into the white curdling cream of the squall squall whale and harpoon had all blended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped though completely swamped the boat was nearly unharmed swimming round it we picked up the floating oars and lashing them across the gunwale tumbled back to our places there we sat up to our knees in the sea the water covering every rib and plank so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean the wind increased to a howl the waves dashed their bucklers together the whole squall roared forked and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal in these jaws of death in vain we hailed the other boats as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm meanwhile the driving scud rack and mist grew darker with the shadows of night no sign of the ship could be seen the rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat the oars were useless as propellers performing now the office of lifepreservers so cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failures starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretching it on a waif pole handed it to queequeg as the standardbearer of this forlorn hope there then he sat holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness there then he sat the sign and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair wet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship or boat we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on the mist still spread over the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat suddenly queequeg started to his feet hollowing his hand to his ear we all heard a faint creaking as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm the sound came nearer and nearer the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge vague form affrighted we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ships bows like a chip at the base of a cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern again we swam for it were dashed against it by the seas and were at last taken up and safely landed on board ere the squall came close to the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time the ship had given us up but was still cruising if haply it might light upon some token of our perishingan oar or a lance pole chapter the hyena there are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than suspects that the joke is at nobodys expense but his own however nothing dispirits and nothing seems worth while disputing he bolts down all events all creeds and beliefs and persuasions all hard things visible and invisible never mind how knobby as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints and as for small difficulties and worryings prospects of sudden disaster peril of life and limb all these and death itself seem to him only sly goodnatured hits and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker that odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking of comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation it comes in the very midst of his earnestness so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous now seems but a part of the general joke there is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with it i now regarded this whole voyage of the pequod and the great white whale its object queequeg said i when they had dragged me the last man to the deck and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water queequeg my fine friend does this sort of thing often happen without much emotion though soaked through just like me he gave me to understand that such things did often happen mr stubb said i turning to that worthy who buttoned up in his oiljacket was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain mr stubb i think i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief mate mr starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent i suppose then that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whalemans discretion certain ive lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off cape horn mr flask said i turning to little kingpost who was standing close by you are experienced in these things and i am not will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery mr flask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself backforemost into deaths jaws cant you twist that smaller said flask yes thats the law i should like to see a boats crew backing water up to a whale face foremost ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mind that here then from three impartial witnesses i had a deliberate statement of the entire case considering therefore that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boatoftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to starbucks driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall and considering that starbuck notwithstanding was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery considering that i belonged to this uncommonly prudent starbucks boat and finally considering in what a devils chase i was implicated touching the white whale taking all things together i say i thought i might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will queequeg said i come along you shall be my lawyer executor and legatee it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion this was the fourth time in my nautical life that i had done the same thing after the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion i felt all the easier a stone was rolled away from my heart besides all the days i should now live would be as good as the days that lazarus lived after his resurrection a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be i survived myself my death and burial were locked up in my chest i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault now then thought i unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock here goes for a cool collected dive at death and destruction and the devil fetch the hindmost chapter ahabs boat and crew fedallah who would have thought it flask cried stubb if i had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat unless maybe to stop the plughole with my timber toe oh hes a wonderful old man i dont think it so strange after all on that account said flask if his leg were off at the hip now it would be a different thing that would disable him but he has one knee and good part of the other left you know i dont know that my little man i never yet saw him kneel among whalewise people it has often been argued whether considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase so tamerlanes soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties that every individual moment indeed then comprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whaleboat in the hunt as a general thing the jointowners of the pequod must have plainly thought not ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the huntabove all for captain ahab to be supplied with five extra men as that same boats crew he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the pequod therefore he had not solicited a boats crew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter until cabacos published discovery the sailors had little foreseen it though to be sure when after being a little while out of port all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service when some time after this ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making tholepins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this was observed in him and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat as it is sometimes called the horizontal piece in the boats bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semicircular depression in the cleat and with the carpenters chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there all these things i say had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time but almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of moby dick for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person but such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boats crew being assigned to that boat now with the subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon waned away for in a whaler wonders soon wane besides now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ashholes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks bits of wreck oars whaleboats canoes blownoff japanese junks and what not that beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle but be all this as it may certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew though still as it were somehow distinct from them yet that hairturbaned fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last whence he came in a mannerly world like this by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with ahabs peculiar fortunes nay so far as to have some sort of a halfhinted influence heaven knows but it might have been even authority over him all this none knew but one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning fedallah he was such a creature as civilized domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams and that but dimly but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging asiatic communities especially the oriental isles to the east of the continentthose insulated immemorial unalterable countries which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earths primal generations when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection and all men his descendants unknowing whence he came eyed each other as real phantoms and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end when though according to genesis the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men the devils also add the uncanonical rabbins indulged in mundane amours chapter the spiritspout days weeks passed and under easy sail the ivory pequod had slowly swept across four several cruisinggrounds that off the azores off the cape de verdes on the plate so called being off the mouth of the rio de la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked watery locality southerly from st helena it was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver and by their soft suffusing seethings made what seemed a silvery silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow lit up by the moon it looked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea fedallah first descried this jet for of these moonlight nights it was his wont to mount to the mainmast head and stand a lookout there with the same precision as if it had been day and yet though herds of whales were seen by night not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them you may think with what emotions then the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours his turban and the moon companions in one sky but when after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound when after all this silence his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moonlit jet every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew there she blows had the trump of judgment blown they could not have quivered more yet still they felt no terror rather pleasure for though it was a most unwonted hour yet so impressive was the cry and so deliriously exciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering walking the deck with quick sidelunging strides ahab commanded the tgallant sails and royals to be set and every stunsail spread the best man in the ship must take the helm then with every masthead manned the piledup craft rolled down before the wind the strange upheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails made the buoyant hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet while still she rushed along as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in herone to mount direct to heaven the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and had you watched ahabs face that night you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring while his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffintap on life and death this old man walked but though the ship so swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrows the eager glances shot yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night every sailor swore he saw it once but not a second time this midnightspout had almost grown a forgotten thing when some days after lo at the same silent hour it was again announced again it was descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it once more it disappeared as if it had never been and so it served us night after night till no one heeded it but to wonder at it mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might be disappearing again for one whole day or two days or three and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on nor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordance with the preternaturalness as it seemed which in many things invested the pequod were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried at however remote times or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes that unnearable spout was cast by one selfsame whale and that whale moby dick for a time there reigned too a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on in order that the monster might turn round upon us and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas these temporary apprehensions so vague but so awful derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather in which beneath all its blue blandness some thought there lurked a devilish charm as for days and days we voyaged along through seas so wearily lonesomely mild that all space in repugnance to our vengeful errand seemed vacating itself of life before our urnlike prow but at last when turning to the eastward the cape winds began howling around us and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seas that are there when the ivorytusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast and gored the dark waves in her madness till like showers of silver chips the foamflakes flew over her bulwarks then all this desolate vacuity of life went away but gave place to sights more dismal than before close to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable searavens and every morning perched on our stays rows of these birds were seen and spite of our hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp as though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing appointed to desolation and therefore fit roostingplace for their homeless selves and heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved the black sea as if its vast tides were a conscience and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred cape of good hope do they call ye rather cape tormentoso as called of yore for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store or beat that black air without any horizon but calm snowwhite and unvarying still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky still beckoning us on from before the solitary jet would at times be descried during all this blackness of the elements ahab though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than ever addressed his mates in tempestuous times like these after everything above and aloft has been secured nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale then captain and crew become practical fatalists so with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together meantime the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the better to guard against the leaping waves each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail in which he swung as in a loosened belt few or no words were spoken and the silent ship as if manned by painted sailors in wax day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves by night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed still in silence the men swung in the bowlines still wordless ahab stood up to the blast even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock never could starbuck forget the old mans aspect when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floorscrewed chair the rain and halfmelted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat on the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand though the body was erect the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the telltale that swung from a beam in the ceiling the cabincompass is called the telltale because without going to the compass at the helm the captain while below can inform himself of the course of the ship terrible old man thought starbuck with a shudder sleeping in this gale still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose chapter the albatross southeastward from the cape off the distant crozetts a good cruising ground for right whalemen a sail loomed ahead the goney albatross by name as she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the foremasthead i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheriesa whaler at sea and long absent from home as if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus all down her sides this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoarfrost only her lower sails were set a wild sight it was to see her longbearded lookouts at those three mastheads they seemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea and though when the ship slowly glided close under our stern we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mastheads of one ship to those of the other yet those forlornlooking fishermen mildly eyeing us as they passed said not one word to our own lookouts while the quarterdeck hail was being heard from below ship ahoy have ye seen the white whale but as the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwarks was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehow fell from his hand into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain strove to make himself heard without it meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between while in various silent ways the seamen of the pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the white whales name to another ship ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade but taking advantage of his windward position he again seized his trumpet and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer and shortly bound home he loudly hailedahoy there this is the pequod bound round the world tell them to address all future letters to the pacific ocean and this time three years if i am not at home tell them to address them to at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed and instantly then in accordance with their singular ways shoals of small harmless fish that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side darted away with what seemed shuddering fins and ranged themselves fore and aft with the strangers flanks though in the course of his continual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings swim away from me do ye murmured ahab gazing over into the water there seemed but little in the words but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced but turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old lion voiceup helm keep her off round the world round the world there is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started where those that we left behind secure were all the time before us were this world an endless plain and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances and discover sights more sweet and strange than any cyclades or islands of king solomon then there were promise in the voyage but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swims before all human hearts while chasing such over this round globe they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed chapter the gam the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms but even had this not been the case he would not after all perhaps have boarded herjudging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasionsif so it had been that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put for as it eventually turned out he cared not to consort even for five minutes with any stranger captain except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought but all this might remain inadequately estimated were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whalingvessels when meeting each other in foreign seas and especially on a common cruisingground if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york state or the equally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds these twain for the life of them cannot well avoid a mutual salutation and stopping for a moment to interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for a while and resting in concert then how much more natural that upon the illimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earthoff lone fannings island or the far away kings mills how much more natural i say that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails but come into still closer more friendly and sociable contact and especially would this seem to be a matter of course in the case of vessels owned in one seaport and whose captains officers and not a few of the men are personally known to each other and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about for the long absent ship the outwardbounder perhaps has letters on board at any rate she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumbworn files and in return for that courtesy the outwardbound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruisingground to which she may be destined a thing of the utmost importance to her and in degree all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each others track on the cruisingground itself even though they are equally long absent from home for one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third and now far remote vessel and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets besides they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable chat for not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils nor would difference of country make any very essential difference that is so long as both parties speak one language as is the case with americans and english though to be sure from the small number of english whalers such meetings do not very often occur and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them for your englishman is rather reserved and your yankee he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself besides the english whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american whalers regarding the long lean nantucketer with his nondescript provincialisms as a sort of seapeasant but where this superiority in the english whalemen does really consist it would be hard to say seeing that the yankees in one day collectively kill more whales than all the english collectively in ten years but this is a harmless little foible in the english whalehunters which the nantucketer does not take much to heart probably because he knows that he has a few foibles himself so then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea the whalers have most reason to be sociableand they are so whereas some merchant ships crossing each others wake in the midatlantic will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition mutually cutting each other on the high seas like a brace of dandies in broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism upon each others rig as for menofwar when they chance to meet at sea they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings such a ducking of ensigns that there does not seem to be much rightdown hearty goodwill and brotherly love about it at all as touching slaveships meeting why they are in such a prodigious hurry they run away from each other as soon as possible and as for pirates when they chance to cross each others crossbones the first hail ishow many skullsthe same way that whalers hailhow many barrels and that question once answered pirates straightway steer apart for they are infernal villains on both sides and dont like to see overmuch of each others villanous likenesses but look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable freeandeasy whaler what does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather she has a _gam_ a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at it and repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubberboilers and such like pretty exclamations why it is that all merchantseamen and also all pirates and manofwars men and slaveship sailors cherish such a scornful feeling towards whaleships this is a question it would be hard to answer because in the case of pirates say i should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the gallows and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude hence i conclude that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on but what is a _gam_ you might wear out your indexfinger running up and down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word dr johnson never attained to that erudition noah websters ark does not hold it nevertheless this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees certainly it needs a definition and should be incorporated into the lexicon with that view let me learnedly define it gam noun_a social meeting of two_ _or more_ _whaleships generally on a cruisingground when after exchanging hails they exchange visits by boats crews the two captains remaining for the time on board of one ship and the two chief mates on the other_ there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten here all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail so has the whale fishery in a pirate manofwar or slave ship when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and often steers himself with a pretty little milliners tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons but the whaleboat has no seat astern no sofa of that sort whatever and no tiller at all high times indeed if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs and as for a tiller the whaleboat never admits of any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming a complete boats crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree and often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs nor is this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the afteroar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front he is thus completely wedged before and behind and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs but a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth merely make a spread angle of two poles and you cannot stand them up then again it would never do in plain sight of the worlds riveted eyes it would never do i say for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands indeed as token of his entire buoyant selfcommand he generally carries his hands in his trowsers pockets but perhaps being generally very large heavy hands he carries them there for ballast nevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated ones too where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall sayto seize hold of the nearest oarsmans hair and hold on there like grim death chapter the townhos story _as told at the golden inn_ the cape of good hope and all the watery region round about there is much like some noted four corners of a great highway where you meet more travellers than in any other part it was not very long after speaking the goney that another homewardbound whaleman the townho was encountered she was manned almost wholly by polynesians in the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the white whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the townhos story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of god which at times are said to overtake some men this latter circumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ears of captain ahab or his mates for that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the townho himself it was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship one of whom it seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of secrecy but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it in that way that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the full knowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so were they governed in this matter that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequods mainmast interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship the whole of this strange affair i now proceed to put on lasting record the ancient whalecry upon first sighting a whale from the masthead still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin for my humors sake i shall preserve the style in which i once narrated it at lima to a lounging circle of my spanish friends one saints eve smoking upon the thickgilt tiled piazza of the golden inn of those fine cavaliers the young dons pedro and sebastian were on the closer terms with me and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put and which are duly answered at the time some two years prior to my first learning the events which i am about rehearsing to you gentlemen the townho sperm whaler of nantucket was cruising in your pacific here not very many days sail eastward from the eaves of this good golden inn she was somewhere to the northward of the line one morning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common they supposed a swordfish had stabbed her gentlemen but the captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes and therefore being very averse to quit them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued her cruisings the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals but no good luck came more days went by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much so that now taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands there to have his hull hove out and repaired though no small passage was before her yet if the commonest chance favoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way because his pumps were of the best and being periodically relieved at them those sixandthirty men of his could easily keep the ship free never mind if the leak should double on her in truth well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes the townho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado from buffalo lakemanbuffalo pray what is a lakeman and where is buffalo said don sebastian rising in his swinging mat of grass on the eastern shore of our lake erie don buti crave your courtesymay be you shall soon hear further of all that now gentlemen in squaresail brigs and threemasted ships wellnigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla this lakeman in the landlocked heart of our america had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean for in their interflowing aggregate those grand freshwater seas of ourserie and ontario and huron and superior and michiganpossess an oceanlike expansiveness with many of the oceans noblest traits with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes they contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles even as the polynesian waters do in large part are shored by two great contrasting nations as the atlantic is they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east dotted all round their banks here and there are frowned upon by batteries and by the goatlike craggy guns of lofty mackinaw they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories at intervals they yield their beaches to wild barbarians whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in gothic genealogies those same woods harboring wild afric beasts of prey and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to tartar emperors they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo and cleveland as well as winnebago villages they float alike the fullrigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state the steamer and the beech canoe they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave they know what shipwrecks are for out of sight of land however inland they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew thus gentlemen though an inlander steelkilt was wildocean born and wildocean nurtured as much of an audacious mariner as any and for radney though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach to nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn handled bowieknives yet was this nantucketer a man with some goodhearted traits and this lakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexible firmness only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slaves right thus treated this steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile at all events he had proved so thus far but radney was doomed and made mad and steelkiltbut gentlemen you shall hear it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven that the townhos leak seemed again increasing but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic for example some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it though of a still sleepy night should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward gentlemen is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pumphandles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters some really landless latitude that her captain begins to feel a little anxious much this way had it been with the townho so when her leak was found gaining once more there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way expanded to the breeze now this radney i suppose was as little of a coward and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine gentlemen therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her so when they were working that evening at the pumps there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water clear as any mountain spring gentlementhat bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupperholes now as you well know it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ourswatery or otherwise that when a person placed in command over his fellowmen finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subalterns tower and make a little heap of dust of it be this conceit of mine as it may gentlemen at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a roman and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroys snorting charger and a brain and a heart and a soul in him gentlemen which had made steelkilt charlemagne had he been born son to charlemagnes father but radney the mate was ugly as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn as malicious he did not love steelkilt and steelkilt knew it espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest the lakeman affected not to notice him but unawed went on with his gay banterings aye aye my merry lads its a lively leak this hold a cannikin one of ye and lets have a taste by the lord its worth bottling i tell ye what men old rads investment must go for it he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home the fact is boys that swordfish only began the job hes come back again with a gang of shipcarpenters sawfish and filefish and what not and the whole posse of em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making improvements i suppose if old rad were here now id tell him to jump overboard and scatter em theyre playing the devil with his estate i can tell him but hes a simple old soulrad and a beauty too boys they say the rest of his property is invested in lookingglasses i wonder if hed give a poor devil like me the model of his nose damn your eyes whats that pump stopping for roared radney pretending not to have heard the sailors talk thunder away at it aye aye sir said steelkilt merry as a cricket lively boys lively now and with that the pump clanged like fifty fireengines the men tossed their hats off to it and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of lifes utmost energies quitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the lakeman went forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his face fiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow now what cozening fiend it was gentlemen that possessed radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state i know not but so it happened intolerably striding along the deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and also a shovel and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large now gentlemen sweeping a ships deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time such gentlemen is the inflexibility of seausages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces but in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys if boys there be aboard besides it was the stronger men in the townho that had been divided into gangs taking turns at the pumps and being the most athletic seaman of them all steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties such being the case with his comrades i mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men but there was more than this the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt as though radney had spat in his face any man who has gone sailor in a whaleship will understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command but as he sat still for a moment and as he steadfastly looked into the mates malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powdercasks heaped up in him and the slowmatch silently burning along towards them as he instinctively saw all this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful beinga repugnance most felt when felt at all by really valiant men even when aggrievedthis nameless phantom feeling gentlemen stole over steelkilt therefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business and he would not do it and then without at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had done little or nothing all day to this radney replied with an oath in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with an uplifted coopers club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensed radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face furiously commanding him to do his bidding steelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated his intention not to obey seeing however that his forbearance had not the slightest effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but it was to no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor the lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer mr radney i will not obey you take that hammer away or look to yourself but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where the lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions retreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would murder him but gentlemen the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads they were both canallers canallers cried don pedro we have seen many whaleships in our harbours but never heard of your canallers pardon who and what are they canallers don are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal you must have heard of it nay senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary land we know but little of your vigorous north aye well then don refill my cup your chichas very fine and ere proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are for such information may throw sidelight upon my story for three hundred and sixty miles gentlemen through the entire breadth of the state of new york through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages through long dismal uninhabited swamps and affluent cultivated fields unrivalled for fertility by billiardroom and barroom through the holyofholies of great forests on roman arches over indian rivers through sun and shade by happy hearts or broken through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk counties and especially by rows of snowwhite chapels whose spires stand almost like milestones flows one continual stream of venetianly corrupt and often lawless life theres your true ashantee gentlemen there howl your pagans where you ever find them next door to you under the longflung shadow and the snug patronising lee of churches for by some curious fatality as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice so sinners gentlemen most abound in holiest vicinities is that a friar passing said don pedro looking downwards into the crowded plazza with humorous concern well for our northern friend dame isabellas inquisition wanes in lima laughed don sebastian proceed senor a moment pardon cried another of the company in the name of all us limeese i but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima for distant venice in your corrupt comparison oh do not bow and look surprised you know the proverb all along this coastcorrupt as lima it but bears out your saying too churches more plentiful than billiardtables and for ever openand corrupt as lima so too venice i have been there the holy city of the blessed evangelist st markst dominic purge it your cup thanks here i refill now you pour out again freely depicted in his own vocation gentlemen the canaller would make a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he like mark antony for days and days along his greenturfed flowery nile he indolently floats openly toying with his redcheeked cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore all this effeminacy is dashed the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly sports his slouched and gailyribboned hat betoken his grand features a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities once a vagabond on his own canal i have received good turns from one of these canallers i thank him heartily would fain be not ungrateful but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one in sum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whalefishery contains so many of its most finished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling captains nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a christian cornfield and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas i see i see impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles no need to travel the worlds one lima i had thought now that at your temperate north the generations were cold and holy as the hillsbut the story i left off gentlemen where the lakeman shook the backstay hardly had he done so when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers who all crowded him to the deck but sliding down the ropes like baleful comets the two canallers rushed into the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out of harms way the valiant captain danced up and down with a whalepike calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarterdeck at intervals he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion and prying into the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the object of his resentment but steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass these seaparisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade come out of that ye pirates roared the captain now menacing them with a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the steward come out of that ye cutthroats steelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there defied the worst the pistols could do but gave the captain to understand distinctly that his steelkilts death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty will you promise not to touch us if we do demanded their ringleader turn to turn toi make no promiseto your duty do you want to sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this turn to and he once more raised a pistol sink the ship cried steelkilt aye let her sink not a man of us turns to unless you swear not to raise a ropeyarn against us what say ye men turning to his comrades a fierce cheer was their response the lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eye on the captain and jerking out such sentences as theseits not our fault we didnt want it i told him to take his hammer away it was boys business he might have known me before this i told him not to prick the buffalo i believe i have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw aint those mincing knives down in the forecastle there men look to those handspikes my hearties captain by god look to yourself say the word dont be a fool forget it all we are ready to turn to treat us decently and were your men but we wont be flogged turn to i make no promises turn to i say look ye now cried the lakeman flinging out his arm towards him there are a few of us here and i am one of them who have shipped for the cruise dye see now as you well know sir we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down so we dont want a row its not our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work but we wont be flogged turn to roared the captain steelkilt glanced round him a moment and then saidi tell you what it is now captain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shabby rascal we wont lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us but till you say the word about not flogging us we dont do a hands turn down into the forecastle then down with ye ill keep ye there till yere sick of it down ye go shall we cried the ringleader to his men most of them were against it but at length in obedience to steelkilt they preceded him down into their dark den growlingly disappearing like bears into a cave as the lakemans bare head was just level with the planks the captain and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway then opening the slide a little the captain whispered something down the crack closed it and turned the key upon themten in numberleaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far had remained neutral all night a wideawake watch was kept by all the officers forward and aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge after breaking through the bulkhead below but the hours of darkness passed in peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship at sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the deck summoned the prisoners to work but with a yell they refused water was then lowered down to them and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it the captain returned to the quarterdeck twice every day for three days this was repeated but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was delivered and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were ready to turn to the fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution had constrained them to surrender at discretion emboldened by this the captain reiterated his demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged on the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them only three were left better turn to now said the captain with a heartless jeer shut us up again will ye cried steelkilt oh certainly said the captain and the key clicked it was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair it was then that steelkilt proposed to the two canallers thus far apparently of one mind with him to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison and armed with their keen mincing knives long crescentic heavy implements with a handle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for himself he would do this he said whether they joined him or not that was the last night he should spend in that den but the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two they swore they were ready for that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender and what was more they each insisted upon being the first man on deck when the time to make the rush should come but to this their leader as fiercely objected reserving that priority for himself particularly as his two comrades would not yield the one to the other in the matter and both of them could not be first for the ladder would but admit one man at a time and here gentlemen the foul play of these miscreants must come out upon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same piece of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last they in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed their before secret treacheries together and when their leader fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences and bound the sleeper with cords and gagged him with cords and shrieked out for the captain at midnight thinking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle in a few minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder but all these were collared and dragged along the deck like dead cattle and side by side were seized up into the mizzen rigging like three quarters of meat and there they hung till morning damn ye cried the captain pacing to and fro before them the vultures would not touch ye ye villains at sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all roundthought upon the whole he would do sohe ought tojustice demanded it but for the present considering their timely surrender he would let them go with a reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular but as for you ye carrion rogues turning to the three men in the riggingfor you i mean to mince ye up for the trypots and seizing a rope he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors till they yelled no more but lifelessly hung their heads sideways as the two crucified thieves are drawn my wrist is sprained with ye he cried at last but there is still rope enough left for you my fine bantam that wouldnt give up take that gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can say for himself for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head said in a sort of hiss what i say is thisand mind it wellif you flog me i murder you say ye so then see how ye frighten meand the captain drew off with the rope to strike best not hissed the lakeman but i mustand the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke steelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captain who to the amazement of all hands started back paced the deck rapidly two or three times and then suddenly throwing down his rope said i wont do itlet him gocut him down dye hear but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order a pale man with a bandaged head arrested themradney the chief mate ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing the tumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole scene such was the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe you are a coward hissed the lakeman so i am but take that the mate was in the very act of striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausing no more made good his word spite of steelkilts threat whatever that might have been the three men were then cut down all hands were turned to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen the iron pumps clanged as before just after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamor was heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitors running up besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crew entreaties cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own instance they were put down in the ships run for salvation still no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest on the contrary it seemed that mainly at steelkilts instigation they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness obey all orders to the last and when the ship reached port desert her in a body but in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thingnamely not to sing out for whales in case any should be discovered for spite of her leak and spite of all her other perils the townho still maintained her mastheads and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least till all was over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart he was in radney the chief mates watch and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rigging he insisted against the express counsel of the captain upon resuming the head of his watch at night upon this and one or two other circumstances steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge during the night radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarterdeck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there a little above the ships side in this attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed there was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between this was the sea steelkilt calculated his time and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two oclock in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed at his leisure he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below what are you making there said a shipmate what do you think what does it look like like a lanyard for your bag but its an odd one seems to me yes rather oddish said the lakeman holding it at arms length before him but i think it will answer shipmate i havent enough twinehave you any but there was none in the forecastle then i must get some from old rad and he rose to go aft you dont mean to go a begging to _him_ said a sailor why not do you think he wont do me a turn when its to help himself in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked at him quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock it was given himneither twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night an iron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of the lakemans monkey jacket as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow twentyfour hours after his trick at the silent helmnigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seamans handthat fatal hour was then to come and in the foreordaining soul of steelkilt the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed in but gentlemen a fool saved the wouldbe murderer from the bloody deed he had planned yet complete revenge he had and without being the avenger for by a mysterious fatality heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day when they were washing down the decks that a stupid teneriffe man drawing water in the mainchains all at once shouted out there she rolls there she rolls jesu what a whale it was moby dick moby dick cried don sebastian st dominic sir sailor but do whales have christenings whom call you moby dick a very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster donbut that would be too long a story how how cried all the young spaniards crowding nay dons donsnay nay i cannot rehearse that now let me get more into the air sirs the chicha the chicha cried don pedro our vigorous friend looks faintfill up his empty glass no need gentlemen one moment and i proceednow gentlemen so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the shipforgetful of the compact among the crewin the excitement of the moment the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mastheads all was now a phrensy the white whalethe white whale was the cry from captain mates and harpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumours were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyed askance and with curses the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea gentlemen a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted the mutineer was the bowsman of the mate and when fast to a fish it was his duty to sit next him while radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slacken the line at the word of command moreover when the four boats were lowered the mates got the start and none howled more fiercely with delight than did steelkilt as he strained at his oar after a stiff pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand radney sprang to the bow he was always a furious man it seems in a boat and now his bandaged cry was to beach him on the whales topmost back nothing loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out the standing mate that instant as he fell on the whales slippery back the boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while radney was tossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale he struck out through the spray and for an instant was dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick but the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and rearing high up with him plunged headlong again and went down meantime at the first tap of the boats bottom the lakeman had slackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly looking on he thought his own thoughts but a sudden terrific downward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line he cut it and the whale was free but at some distance moby dick rose again with some tatters of radneys red woollen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed him all four boats gave chase again but the whale eluded them and finally wholly disappeared in good time the townho reached her porta savage solitary placewhere no civilized creature resided there headed by the lakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large double warcanoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor the ships company being reduced to but a handful the captain called upon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak but to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both by night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent that upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel after taking counsel with his officers he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows stacked his muskets on the poop and warning the islanders not to approach the ship at their peril took one man with him and setting the sail of his best whaleboat steered straight before the wind for tahiti five hundred miles distant to procure a reinforcement to his crew on the fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals he steered away from it but the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water the captain presented a pistol with one foot on each prow of the yoked warcanoes the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubbles and foam what do you want of me cried the captain where are you bound and for what are you bound demanded steelkilt no lies i am bound to tahiti for more men very good let me board you a momenti come in peace with that he leaped from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwale stood face to face with the captain cross your arms sir throw back your head now repeat after me as soon as steelkilt leaves me i swear to beach this boat on yonder island and remain there six days if i do not may lightnings strike me a pretty scholar laughed the lakeman adios senor and leaping into the sea he swam back to his comrades watching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the roots of the cocoanut trees steelkilt made sail again and in due time arrived at tahiti his own place of destination there luck befriended him two ships were about to sail for france and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed they embarked and so for ever got the start of their former captain had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution some ten days after the french ships sailed the whaleboat arrived and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a small native schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all right there again resumed his cruisings where steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the island of nantucket the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him are you through said don sebastian quietly i am don then i entreat you tell me if to the best of your own convictions this your story is in substance really true it is so passing wonderful did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with me if i seem to press also bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in don sebastians suit cried the company with exceeding interest is there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inn gentlemen nay said don sebastian but i know a worthy priest near by who will quickly procure one for me i go for it but are you well advised this may grow too serious will you be so good as to bring the priest also don though there are no autodafés in lima now said one of the company to another i fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy let us withdraw more out of the moonlight i see no need of this excuse me for running after you don sebastian but may i also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized evangelists you can this is the priest he brings you the evangelists said don sebastian gravely returning with a tall and solemn figure let me remove my hat now venerable priest further into the light and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it so help me heaven and on my honor the story i have told ye gentlemen is in substance and its great items true i know it to be true it happened on this ball i trod the ship i knew the crew i have seen and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney chapter of the monstrous pictures of whales i shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there it may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman it is time to set the world right in this matter by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculptures for ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples the pedestals of statues and on shields medallions cups and coins the dolphin was drawn in scales of chainarmor like saladins and a helmeted head like st georges ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed not only in most popular pictures of the whale but in many scientific presentations of him now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whales is to be found in the famous cavernpagoda of elephanta in india the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda all the trades and pursuits every conceivable avocation of man were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being no wonder then that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth the hindoo whale referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly known as the matse avatar but though this sculpture is half man and half whale so as only to give the tail of the latter yet that small section of him is all wrong it looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the broad palms of the true whales majestic flukes but go to the old galleries and look now at a great christian painters portrait of this fish for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian hindoo it is guidos picture of perseus rescuing andromeda from the seamonster or whale where did guido get the model of such a strange creature as that nor does hogarth in painting the same scene in his own perseus descending make out one whit better the huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the surface scarcely drawing one inch of water it has a sort of howdah on its back and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling might be taken for the traitors gate leading from the thames by water into the tower then there are the prodromus whales of old scotch sibbald and jonahs whale as depicted in the prints of old bibles and the cuts of old primers what shall be said of these as for the bookbinders whale winding like a vinestalk round the stock of a descending anchoras stamped and gilded on the backs and titlepages of many books both old and newthat is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature imitated i take it from the like figures on antique vases though universally denominated a dolphin i nevertheless call this bookbinders fish an attempt at a whale because it was so intended when the device was first introduced it was introduced by an old italian publisher somewhere about the th century during the revival of learning and in those days and even down to a comparatively late period dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the leviathan in the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale where all manner of spouts jets deau hot springs and cold saratoga and badenbaden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain in the titlepage of the original edition of the advancement of learning you will find some curious whales but quitting all these unprofessional attempts let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober scientific delineations by those who know in old harriss collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages ad entitled a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the whale peter peterson of friesland master in one of those plates the whales like great rafts of logs are represented lying among iceisles with white bears running over their living backs in another plate the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes then again there is an imposing quarto written by one captain colnett a post captain in the english navy entitled a voyage round cape horn into the south seas for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale fisheries in this book is an outline purporting to be a picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of mexico august and hoisted on deck i doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines to mention but one thing about it let me say that it has an eye which applied according to the accompanying scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bowwindow some five feet long ah my gallant captain why did ye not give us jonah looking out of that eye nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for the benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of mistake look at that popular work goldsmiths animated nature in the abridged london edition of there are plates of an alleged whale and a narwhale i do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow and as for the narwhale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys then again in bernard germain count de lacépède a great naturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are several pictures of the different species of the leviathan all these are not only incorrect but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland whale that is to say the right whale even scoresby a long experienced man as touching that species declares not to have its counterpart in nature but the placing of the capsheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier brother to the famous baron in he published a natural history of whales in which he gives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale before showing that picture to any nantucketer you had best provide for your summary retreat from nantucket in a word frederick cuviers sperm whale is not a sperm whale but a squash of course he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence he derived that picture who can tell perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field desmarest got one of his authentic abortions that is from a chinese drawing and what sort of lively lads with the pencil those chinese are many queer cups and saucers inform us as for the signpainters whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oildealers what shall be said of them they are generally richard iii whales with dromedary humps and very savage breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats full of mariners their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint but these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all consider most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars though elephants have stood for their fulllengths the living leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait the living whale in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight like a launched lineofbattle ship and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations and not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a fullgrown platonian leviathan yet even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ships deck such is then the outlandish eellike limbered varying shape of him that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch but it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form not at all for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape though jeremy benthams skeleton which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors correctly conveys the idea of a burlybrowed utilitarian old gentleman with all jeremys other leading personal characteristics yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathans articulated bones in fact as the great hunter says the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown it is also very curiously displayed in the side fin the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand minus only the thumb this fin has four regular bonefingers the index middle ring and little finger but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering as the human fingers in an artificial covering however recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us said humorous stubb one day he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens for all these reasons then any way you may look at it you must needs conclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last true one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness so there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like and the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is by going a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him wherefore it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan chapter of the less erroneous pictures of whales and the true pictures of whaling scenes in connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales i am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books both ancient and modern especially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier etc but i pass that matter by i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale colnetts hugginss frederick cuviers and beales in the previous chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to hugginss is far better than theirs but by great odds beales is the best all beales drawings of this whale are good excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes capping his second chapter his frontispiece boats attacking sperm whales though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is admirably correct and lifelike in its general effect some of the sperm whale drawings in j ross browne are pretty correct in contour but they are wretchedly engraved that is not his fault though of the right whale the best outline pictures are in scoresby but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression he has but one picture of whaling scenes and this is a sad deficiency because it is by such pictures only when at all well done that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters but taken for all in all by far the finest though in some details not the most correct presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found are two large french engravings well executed and taken from paintings by one garnery respectively they represent attacks on the sperm and right whale in the first engraving a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks the prow of the boat is partially unbroken and is drawn just balancing upon the monsters spine and standing in that prow for that one single incomputable flash of time you behold an oarsman half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale and in the act of leaping as if from a precipice the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true the halfemptied linetub floats on the whitened sea the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me i could not draw so good a one in the second engraving the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right whale that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rockslide from the patagonian cliffs his jets are erect full and black like soot so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs shellfish and other sea candies and maccaroni which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back and all the while the thicklipped leviathan is rushing through the deep leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddlewheels of an ocean steamer thus the foreground is all raging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast is the glassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whalepole inserted into his spouthole who garnery the painter is or was i know not but my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman the french are the lads for painting action go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas as in that triumphal hall at versailles where the beholder fights his way pellmell through the consecutive great battles of france where every sword seems a flash of the northern lights and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by like a charge of crowned centaurs not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery are these sea battlepieces of garnery the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes with not one tenth of englands experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the americans they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt for the most part the english and american whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things such as the vacant profile of the whale which so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid even scoresby the justly renowned right whaleman after giving us a stiff full length of the greenland whale and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks chopping knives and grapnels and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninetysix facsimiles of magnified arctic snow crystals i mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager i honor him for a veteran but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice of the peace in addition to those fine engravings from garnery there are two other french engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribes himself h durand one of them though not precisely adapted to our present purpose nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts it is a quiet noonscene among the isles of the pacific a french whaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the background both drooping together in the breezeless air the effect is very fine when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose the other engraving is quite a different affair the ship hoveto upon the open sea and in the very heart of the leviathanic life with a right whale alongside the vessel in the act of cuttingin hove over to the monster as if to a quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is about giving chase to whales in the distance the harpoons and lances lie levelled for use three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft stands halferect out of the water like a rearing horse from the ship the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies and to windward a black cloud rising up with earnest of squalls and rains seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen chapter of whales in paint in teeth in wood in sheetiron in stone in mountains in stars on towerhill as you go down to the london docks you may have seen a crippled beggar or _kedger_ as the sailors say holding a painted board before him representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg there are three whales and three boats and one of the boats presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale any time these ten years they tell me has that man held up that picture and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world but the time of his justification has now come his three whales are as good whales as were ever published in wapping at any rate and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings but though for ever mounted on that stump never a stumpspeech does the poor whaleman make but with downcast eyes stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation throughout the pacific and also in nantucket and new bedford and sag harbor you will come across lively sketches of whales and whalingscenes graven by the fishermen themselves on sperm whaleteeth or ladies busks wrought out of the right whalebone and other like skrimshander articles as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material in their hours of ocean leisure some of them have little boxes of dentisticallooking implements specially intended for the skrimshandering business but in general they toil with their jackknives alone and with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor they will turn you out anything you please in the way of a mariners fancy long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which god placed him _ie_ what is called savagery your true whalehunter is as much a savage as an iroquois i myself am a savage owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals and ready at any moment to rebel against him now one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours is his wonderful patience of industry an ancient hawaiian warclub or spearpaddle in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon for with but a bit of broken seashell or a sharks tooth that miraculous intricacy of wooden network has been achieved and it has cost steady years of steady application as with the hawaiian savage so with the white sailorsavage with the same marvellous patience and with the same single sharks tooth of his one poor jackknife he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture not quite as workmanlike but as close packed in its maziness of design as the greek savage achilless shield and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness as the prints of that fine old dutch savage albert durer wooden whales or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble south sea warwood are frequently met with in the forecastles of american whalers some of them are done with much accuracy at some old gableroofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the roadside door when the porter is sleepy the anvilheaded whale would be best but these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays on the spires of some oldfashioned churches you will see sheetiron whales placed there for weathercocks but they are so elevated and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with _hands off_ you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit in bony ribby regions of the earth where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the leviathan partly merged in grass which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges then again in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges but you must be a thorough whaleman to see these sights and not only that but if you wish to return to such a sight again you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first standpoint else so chancelike are such observations of the hills that your precise previous standpoint would require a laborious rediscovery like the soloma islands which still remain incognita though once highruffed mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them nor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of them as when long filled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds thus at the north have i chased leviathan round and round the pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me and beneath the effulgent antarctic skies i have boarded the argonavis and joined the chase against the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying fish with a frigates anchors for my bridlebitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs would i could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight chapter brit steering northeastward from the crozetts we fell in with vast meadows of brit the minute yellow substance upon which the right whale largely feeds for leagues and leagues it undulated round us so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat on the second day numbers of right whales were seen who secure from the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit which adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous venetian blind in their mouths was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip as morning mowers who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads even so these monsters swam making a strange grassy cutting sound and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea that part of the sea known among whalemen as the brazil banks does not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do because of there being shallows and soundings there but because of this remarkable meadowlike appearance caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes where the right whale is often chased but it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers seen from the mastheads especially when they paused and were stationary for a while their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else and as in the great hunting countries of india the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such taking them for bare blackened elevations of the soil even so often with him who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea and even when recognised at last their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all parts with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse indeed in other respects you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore for though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea and though taking a broad general view of the thing this may very well be yet coming to specialties where for example does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog the accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him but though to landsmen in general the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one though by vast odds the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters though but a moments consideration will teach that however baby man may brag of his science and skill and however much in a flattering future that science and skill may augment yet for ever and for ever to the crack of doom the sea will insult and murder him and pulverize the stateliest stiffest frigate he can make nevertheless by the continual repetition of these very impressions man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it the first boat we read of floated on an ocean that with portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow that same ocean rolls now that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year yea foolish mortals noahs flood is not yet subsided two thirds of the fair world it yet covers wherein differ the sea and the land that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other preternatural terrors rested upon the hebrews when under the feet of korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever yet not a modern sun ever sets but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it but it is also a fiend to its own offspring worse than the persian host who murdered his own guests sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships no mercy no power but its own controls it panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider the masterless ocean overruns the globe consider the subtleness of the sea how its most dreaded creatures glide under water unapparent for the most part and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks consider once more the universal cannibalism of the sea all whose creatures prey upon each other carrying on eternal war since the world began consider all this and then turn to this green gentle and most docile earth consider them both the sea and the land and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself for as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land so in the soul of man there lies one insular tahiti full of peace and joy but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life god keep thee push not off from that isle thou canst never return chapter squid slowly wading through the meadows of brit the pequod still held on her way northeastward towards the island of java a gentle air impelling her keel so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze as three mild palms on a plain and still at wide intervals in the silvery night the lonely alluring jet would be seen but one transparent blue morning when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea however unattended with any stagnant calm when the long burnished sunglade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them enjoining some secrecy when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by daggoo from the mainmasthead in the distance a great white mass lazily rose and rising higher and higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamed before our prow like a snowslide new slid from the hills thus glistening for a moment as slowly it subsided and sank then once more arose and silently gleamed it seemed not a whale and yet is this moby dick thought daggoo again the phantom went down but on reappearing once more with a stilettolike cry that startled every man from his nod the negro yelled outthere there again there she breaches right ahead the white whale the white whale upon this the seamen rushed to the yardarms as in swarmingtime the bees rush to the boughs bareheaded in the sultry sun ahab stood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon ahab so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued however this was or whether his eagerness betrayed him whichever way it might have been no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering the four boats were soon on the water ahabs in advance and all swiftly pulling towards their prey soon it went down and while with oars suspended we were awaiting its reappearance lo in the same spot where it sank once more it slowly rose almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of moby dick we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind a vast pulpy mass furlongs in length and breadth of a glancing creamcolour lay floating on the water innumerable long arms radiating from its centre and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach no perceptible face or front did it have no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct but undulated there on the billows an unearthly formless chancelike apparition of life as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk with a wild voice exclaimedalmost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him than to have seen thee thou white ghost what was it sir said flask the great live squid which they say few whaleships ever beheld and returned to their ports to tell of it but ahab said nothing turning his boat he sailed back to the vessel the rest as silently following whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object certain it is that a glimpse of it being so very unusual that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness so rarely is it beheld that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food for though other species of whales find their food above water and may be seen by man in the act of feeding the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what precisely that food consists at times when closely pursued he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length they fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike other species is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid the manner in which the bishop describes it as alternately rising and sinking with some other particulars he narrates in all this the two correspond but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature here spoken of it is included among the class of cuttlefish to which indeed in certain external respects it would seem to belong but only as the anak of the tribe chapter the line with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented i have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whaleline the line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp slightly vapored with tar not impregnated with it as in the case of ordinary ropes for while tar as ordinarily used makes the hemp more pliable to the ropemaker and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whaleline for the close coiling to which it must be subjected but as most seamen are beginning to learn tar in general by no means adds to the ropes durability or strength however much it may give it compactness and gloss of late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whalelines for though not so durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elastic and i will add since there is an æsthetics in all things is much more handsome and becoming to the boat than hemp hemp is a dusky dark fellow a sort of indian but manilla is as a goldenhaired circassian to behold the whaleline is only twothirds of an inch in thickness at first sight you would not think it so strong as it really is by experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons in length the common sperm whaleline measures something over two hundred fathoms towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub not like the wormpipe of a still though but so as to form one round cheeseshaped mass of densely bedded sheaves or layers of concentric spiralizations without any hollow but the heart or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly take somebodys arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs there is some advantage in this because these twintubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat and do not strain it so much whereas the american tub nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one halfinch in thickness for the bottom of the whaleboat is like critical ice which will bear up a considerable distributed weight but not very much of a concentrated one when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american linetub the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great weddingcake to present to the whales both ends of the line are exposed the lower end terminating in an eyesplice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts first in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon in these instances the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale as it were from the one boat to the other though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort second this arrangement is indispensable for common safetys sake for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smoking minute as he sometimes does he would not stop there for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea and in that case no towncrier would ever find her again before lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there is again carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every mans oar so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing and also passing between the men as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill prevents it from slipping out from the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows and is then passed inside the boat again and some ten or twenty fathoms called boxline being coiled upon the box in the bows it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft and is then attached to the shortwarpthe rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon but previous to that connexion the shortwarp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail thus the whaleline folds the whole boat in its complicated coils twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction all the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions so that to the timid eye of the landsman they seem as indian jugglers with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs nor can any son of mortal woman for the first time seat himself amid those hempen intricacies and while straining his utmost at the oar bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly yet habitstrange thing what cannot habit accomplishgayer sallies more merry mirth better jokes and brighter repartees you never heard over your mahogany than you will hear over the halfinch white cedar of the whaleboat when thus hung in hangmans nooses and like the six burghers of calais before king edward the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death with a halter around every neck as you may say perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasterssome few of which are casually chronicledof this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line and lost for when the line is darting out to be seated then in the boat is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steamengine in full play when every flying beam and shaft and wheel is grazing you it is worse for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils because the boat is rocking like a cradle and you are pitched one way and the other without the slightest warning and only by a certain selfadjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action can you escape being made a mazeppa of and run away with where the allseeing sun himself could never pierce you out again as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itself for indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and contains it in itself as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the line as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual playthis is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair but why say more all men live enveloped in whalelines all are born with halters round their necks but it is only when caught in the swift sudden turn of death that mortals realize the silent subtle everpresent perils of life and if you be a philosopher though seated in the whaleboat you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror than though seated before your evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by your side chapter stubb kills a whale if to starbuck the apparition of the squid was a thing of portents to queequeg it was quite a different object when you see him quid said the savage honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat then you quick see him parm whale the next day was exceedingly still and sultry and with nothing special to engage them the pequods crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea for this part of the indian ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground that is it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises dolphins flyingfish and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters than those off the rio de la plata or the inshore ground off peru it was my turn to stand at the foremasthead and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds to and fro i idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air no resolution could withstand it in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness at last my soul went out of my body though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn ere forgetfulness altogether came over me i had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzenmastheads were already drowsy so that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman the waves too nodded their indolent crests and across the wide trance of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes like vices my hands grasped the shrouds some invisible gracious agency preserved me with a shock i came back to life and lo close under our lee not forty fathoms off a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of an ethiopian hue glistening in the suns rays like a mirror but lazily undulating in the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon but that pipe poor whale was thy last as if struck by some enchanters wand the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel simultaneously with the three notes from aloft shouted forth the accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air clear away the boats luff cried ahab and obeying his own order he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes the sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boats were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripples as he swam that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whispers so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of the boats we swiftly but silently paddled along the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set presently as we thus glided in chase the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up there go flukes was the cry an announcement immediately followed by stubbs producing his match and igniting his pipe for now a respite was granted after the full interval of his sounding had elapsed the whale rose again and being now in advance of the smokers boat and much nearer to it than to any of the others stubb counted upon the honor of the capture it was obvious now that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers all silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use paddles were dropped and oars came loudly into play and still puffing at his pipe stubb cheered on his crew to the assault yes a mighty change had come over the fish all alive to his jeopardy he was going head out that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whales enormous head consists though apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyant part about him so that with ease he elevates it in the air and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed besides such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head and such the tapering cutwater formation of the lower part that by obliquely elevating his head he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluffbowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed new york pilotboat start her start her my men dont hurry yourselves take plenty of timebut start her start her like thunderclaps thats all cried stubb spluttering out the smoke as he spoke start her now give em the long and strong stroke tashtego start her tash my boystart her all but keep cool keep coolcucumbers is the wordeasy easyonly start her like grim death and grinning devils and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves boysthats all start her woohoo wahee screamed the gayheader in reply raising some old warwhoop to the skies as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager indian gave but his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild keehee keehee yelled daggoo straining forwards and backwards on his seat like a pacing tiger in his cage kala kooloo howled queequeg as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of grenadiers steak and thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea meanwhile stubb retaining his place in the van still encouraged his men to the onset all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth like desperadoes they tugged and they strained till the welcome cry was heardstand up tashtegogive it to him the harpoon was hurled stern all the oarsmen backed water the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists it was the magical line an instant before stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of its increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe as the line passed round and round the loggerhead so also just before reaching that point it blisteringly passed through and through both of stubbs hands from which the handcloths or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times had accidentally dropped it was like holding an enemys sharp twoedged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch wet the line wet the line cried stubb to the tub oarsman him seated by the tub who snatching off his hat dashed seawater into it more turns were taken so that the line began holding its place the boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins stubb and tashtego here changed placesstem for sterna staggering business truly in that rocking commotion partly to show the indispensableness of this act it may here be stated that in the old dutch fishery a mop was used to dash the running line with water in many other ships a wooden piggin or bailer is set apart for that purpose your hat however is the most convenient from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat and from its now being more tight than a harpstring you would have thought the craft had two keelsone cleaving the water the other the airas the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once a continual cascade played at the bows a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake and at the slightest motion from within even but of a little finger the vibrating cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea thus they rushed each man with might and main clinging to his seat to prevent being tossed to the foam and the tall form of tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double in order to bring down his centre of gravity whole atlantics and pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight haul inhaul in cried stubb to the bowsman and facing round towards the whale all hands began pulling the boat up to him while yet the boat was being towed on soon ranging up by his flank stubb firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the flying fish at the word of command the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whales horrible wallow and then ranging up for another fling the red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake the slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reflection into every face so that they all glowed to each other like red men and all the while jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon his crooked lance by the line attached to it stubb straightened it again and again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale then again and again sent it into the whale pull uppull up he now cried to the bowsman as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath pull upclose to and the boat ranged along the fishs flank when reaching far over the bow stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish and kept it there carefully churning and churning as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out but that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish and now it is struck for starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry the monster horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself in impenetrable mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping astern had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day and now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into view surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contracting his spouthole with sharp cracking agonized respirations at last gush after gush of clotted red gore as if it had been the purple lees of red wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea his heart had burst hes dead mr stubb said daggoo yes both pipes smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouth stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a moment stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made chapter the dart a word concerning an incident in the last chapter according to the invariable usage of the fishery the whaleboat pushes off from the ship with the headsman or whalekiller as temporary steersman and the harpooneer or whalefastener pulling the foremost oar the one known as the harpooneeroar now it needs a strong nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what is called a long dart the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet but however prolonged and exhausting the chase the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost indeed he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest not only by incredible rowing but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations and what it is to keep shouting at the top of ones compass while all the other muscles are strained and half startedwhat that is none know but those who have tried it for one i cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time in this straining bawling state then with his back to the fish all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting crystand up and give it to him he now has to drop and secure his oar turn round on his centre half way seize his harpoon from the crotch and with what little strength may remain he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale no wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body that out of fifty fair chances for a dart not five are successful no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated no wonder that some of them actually burst their bloodvessels in the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels no wonder that to many ship owners whaling is but a losing concern for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant that is when the whale starts to run the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else it is then they change places and the headsman the chief officer of the little craft takes his proper station in the bows of the boat now i care not who maintains the contrary but all this is both foolish and unnecessary the headsman should stay in the bows from first to last he should both dart the harpoon and the lance and no rowing whatever should be expected of him except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them to insure the greatest efficiency in the dart the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness and not from out of toil chapter the crotch out of the trunk the branches grow out of them the twigs so in productive subjects grow the chapters the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention it is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two feet in length which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly projects from the prow thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall it is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch respectively called the first and second irons but these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connected with the line the object being this to dart them both if possible one instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the coming drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold it is a doubling of the chances but it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneer however lightninglike in his movements to pitch the second iron into him nevertheless as the second iron is already connected with the line and the line is running hence that weapon must at all events be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands tumbled into the water it accordingly is in such cases the spare coils of box line mentioned in a preceding chapter making this feat in most instances prudently practicable but this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties furthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharpedged terror skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the lines or cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all directions nor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse consider now how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong active and knowing whale when owing to these qualities in him as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him for of course each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery all these particulars are faithfully narrated here as they will not fail to elucidate several most important however intricate passages in scenes hereafter to be painted chapter stubbs supper stubbs whale had been killed some distance from the ship it was a calm so forming a tandem of three boats we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the pequod and now as we eighteen men with our thirtysix arms and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the sea and it seemed hardly to budge at all except at long intervals good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved for upon the great canal of hangho or whatever they call it in china four or five laborers on the footpath will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along as if laden with piglead in bulk darkness came on but three lights up and down in the pequods mainrigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we saw ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his way into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning though in overseeing the pursuit of this whale captain ahab had evinced his customary activity to call it so yet now that the creature was dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair seemed working in him as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that moby dick was yet to be slain and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship all that would not one jot advance his grand monomaniac object very soon you would have thought from the sound on the pequods decks that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck and thrust rattling out of the portholes but by those clanking links the vast corpse itself not the ship is to be moored tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessels and seen through the darkness of the night which obscured the spars and rigging aloft the twoship and whale seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks whereof one reclines while the other remains standing a little item may as well be related here the strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside is by the flukes or tail and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other excepting the sidefins its flexibility even in death causes it to sink low beneath the surface so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order to put the chain round it but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome a small strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end and a weight in its middle while the other end is secured to the ship by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chain is readily made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes if moody ahab was now all quiescence at least so far as could be known on deck stubb his second mate flushed with conquest betrayed an unusual but still goodnatured excitement such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid starbuck his official superior quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs one small helping cause of all this liveliness in stubb was soon made strangely manifest stubb was a high liver he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate a steak a steak ere i sleep you daggoo overboard you go and cut me one from his small here be it known that though these wild fishermen do not as a general thing and according to the great military maxim make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale designated by stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body about midnight that steak was cut and cooked and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstanhead as if that capstan were a sideboard nor was stubb the only banqueter on whales flesh that night mingling their mumblings with his own mastications thousands on thousands of sharks swarming round the dead leviathan smackingly feasted on its fatness the few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull within a few inches of the sleepers hearts peering over the side you could just see them as before you heard them wallowing in the sullen black waters and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head this particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailable surface they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remains a part of the universal problem of all things the mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a seafight sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ships decks like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant butchers over the decktable are thus cannibally carving each others live meat with carvingknives all gilded and tasselled the sharks also with their jewelhilted mouths are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the whole affair upside down it would still be pretty much the same thing that is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the atlantic systematically trotting alongside to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a dead slave to be decently buried and though one or two other like instances might be set down touching the set terms places and occasions when sharks do most socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers and in gayer or more jovial spirits than around a dead sperm whale moored by night to a whaleship at sea if you have never seen that sight then suspend your decision about the propriety of devilworship and the expediency of conciliating the devil but as yet stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips cook cookwheres that old fleece he cried at length widening his legs still further as if to form a more secure base for his supper and at the same time darting his fork into the dish as if stabbing with his lance cook you cooksail this way cook the old black not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour came shambling along from his galley for like many old blacks there was something the matter with his kneepans which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans this old fleece as they called him came shuffling and limping along assisting his step with his tongs which after a clumsy fashion were made of straightened iron hoops this old ebony floundered along and in obedience to the word of command came to a dead stop on the opposite side of stubbs sideboard when with both hands folded before him and resting on his twolegged cane he bowed his arched back still further over at the same time sideways inclining his head so as to bring his best ear into play cook said stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth dont you think this steak is rather overdone youve been beating this steak too much cook its too tender dont i always say that to be good a whalesteak must be tough there are those sharks now over the side dont you see they prefer it tough and rare what a shindy they are kicking up cook go and talk to em tell em they are welcome to help themselves civilly and in moderation but they must keep quiet blast me if i can hear my own voice away cook and deliver my message here take this lantern snatching one from his sideboard now then go and preach to em sullenly taking the offered lantern old fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks and then with one hand dropping his light low over the sea so as to get a good view of his congregation with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks while stubb softly crawling behind overheard all that was said fellowcritters ise ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare you hear stop dat dam smackin ob de lip massa stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings but by gor you must stop dat dam racket cook here interposed stubb accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shouldercook why damn your eyes you mustnt swear that way when youre preaching thats no way to convert sinners cook who dat den preach to him yourself sullenly turning to go no cook go on go on well den belubed fellowcritters right exclaimed stubb approvingly coax em to it try that

up de damndest row as ever you can fill your dam bellies till dey bustand den die now cook said stubb resuming his supper at the capstan stand just where you stood before there over against me and pay particular attention all dention said fleece again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position well said stubb helping himself freely meanwhile i shall now go back to the subject of this steak in the first place how old are you cook what dat do wid de teak said the old black testily silence how old are you cook bout ninety dey say he gloomily muttered and you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years cook and dont know yet how to cook a whalesteak rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question where were you born cook hind de hatchway in ferryboat goin ober de roanoke born in a ferryboat thats queer too but i want to know what country you were born in cook didnt i say de roanoke country he cried sharply no you didnt cook but ill tell you what im coming to cook you must go home and be born over again you dont know how to cook a whalesteak yet bress my soul if i cook noder one he growled angrily turning round to depart come back cookhere hand me those tongsnow take that bit of steak there and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be take it i sayholding the tongs towards himtake it and taste it faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment the old negro muttered best cooked teak i eber taste joosy berry joosy cook said stubb squaring himself once more do you belong to the church passed one once in capedown said the old man sullenly and you have once in your life passed a holy church in capetown where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellowcreatures have you cook and yet you come here and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now eh said stubb where do you expect to go to cook go to bed berry soon he mumbled halfturning as he spoke avast heave to i mean when you die cook its an awful question now whats your answer when dis old brack man dies said the negro slowly changing his whole air and demeanor he hisself wont go nowhere but some bressed angel will come and fetch him fetch him how in a coach and four as they fetched elijah and fetch him where up dere said fleece holding his tongs straight over his head and keeping it there very solemnly so then you expect to go up into our maintop do you cook when you are dead but dont you know the higher you climb the colder it gets maintop eh didnt say dat tall said fleece again in the sulks you said up there didnt you and now look yourself and see where your tongs are pointing but perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubbers hole cook but no no cook you dont get there except you go the regular way round by the rigging its a ticklish business but must be done or else its no go but none of us are in heaven yet drop your tongs cook and hear my orders do ye hear hold your hat in one hand and clap tother atop of your heart when im giving my orders cook what that your heart therethats your gizzard aloft aloftthats itnow you have it hold it there now and pay attention all dention said the old black with both hands placed as desired vainly wriggling his grizzled head as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time well then cook you see this whalesteak of yours was so very bad that i have put it out of sight as soon as possible you see that dont you well for the future when you cook another whalesteak for my private table here the capstan ill tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing hold the steak in one hand and show a live coal to it with the other that done dish it dye hear and now tomorrow cook when we are cutting in the fish be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins have them put in pickle as for the ends of the flukes have them soused cook there now ye may go but fleece had hardly got three paces off when he was recalled cook give me cutlets for supper tomorrow night in the midwatch dye hear away you sail thenhalloa stop make a bow before you goavast heaving again whaleballs for breakfastdont forget wish by gor whale eat him stead of him eat whale im bressed if he aint more of shark dan massa shark hisself muttered the old man limping away with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock chapter the whale as a dish that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp and like stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it it is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the right whale was esteemed a great delicacy in france and commanded large prices there also that in henry viiiths time a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are a species of whale porpoises indeed are to this day considered fine eating the meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtleballs or veal balls the old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them they had a great porpoise grant from the crown the fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but when you come to sit down before a meatpie nearly one hundred feet long it takes away your appetite only the most unprejudiced of men like stubb nowadays partake of cooked whales but the esquimaux are not so fastidious we all know how they live upon whales and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil zogranda one of their most famous doctors recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing and this reminds me that certain englishmen who long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vesselthat these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber among the dutch whalemen these scraps are called fritters which indeed they greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling something like old amsterdam housewives doughnuts or olycooks when fresh they have such an eatable look that the most selfdenying stranger can hardly keep his hands off but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his exceeding richness he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be delicately good look at his hump which would be as fine eating as the buffalos which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such a solid pyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself how bland and creamy that is like the transparent halfjellied white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance and then partaking of it in the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their shipbiscuit into the huge oilpots and let them fry there awhile many a good supper have i thus made in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a fine dish the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the two plump whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling two large puddings they are then mixed with flour and cooked into a most delectable mess in flavor somewhat resembling calves head which is quite a dish among some epicures and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures by continually dining upon calves brains by and by get to have a little brains of their own so as to be able to tell a calfs head from their own heads which indeed requires uncommon discrimination and that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calfs head before him is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see the head looks a sort of reproachfully at him with an et tu brute expression it is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence that appears to result in some way from the consideration before mentioned _ie_ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea and eat it too by its own light but no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer perhaps he was hung and if he had been put on his trial by oxen he certainly would have been and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does go to the meatmarket of a saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibals jaw cannibals who is not a cannibal i tell you it will be more tolerable for the fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine it will be more tolerable for that provident fejee i say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized and enlightened gourmand who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy patédefoiegras but stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that is adding insult to injury is it look at your knifehandle there my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what is that handle made ofwhat but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating and what do you pick your teeth with after devouring that fat goose with a feather of the same fowl and with what quill did the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to ganders formally indite his circulars it is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens chapter the shark massacre when in the southern fishery a captured sperm whale after long and weary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as a general thing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in for that business is an exceedingly laborious one is not very soon completed and requires all hands to set about it therefore the common usage is to take in all sail lash the helm alee and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight with the reservation that until that time anchorwatches shall be kept that is two and two for an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well but sometimes especially upon the line in the pacific this plan will not answer at all because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase that were he left so for six hours say on a stretch little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning in most other parts of the ocean however where these fish do not so largely abound their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whalingspades a procedure notwithstanding which in some instances only seems to tickle them into still greater activity but it was not thus in the present case with the pequods sharks though to be sure any man unaccustomed to such sights to have looked over her side that night would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese and those sharks the maggots in it nevertheless upon stubb setting the anchorwatch after his supper was concluded and when accordingly queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck no small excitement was created among the sharks for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side and lowering three lanterns so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea these two mariners darting their long whalingspades kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls seemingly their only vital part but in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts the marksmen could not always hit their mark and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe they viciously snapped not only at each others disembowelments but like flexible bows bent round and bit their own till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound nor was this all it was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones after what might be called the individual life had departed killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin one of these sharks almost took poor queequegs hand off when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw the whalingspade used for cuttingin is made of the very best steel is about the bigness of a mans spread hand and in general shape corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named only its sides are perfectly flat and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower this weapon is always kept as sharp as possible and when being used is occasionally honed just like a razor in its socket a stiff pole from twenty to thirty feet long is inserted for a handle queequeg no care what god made him shark said the savage agonizingly lifting his hand up and down wedder fejee god or nantucket god but de god wat made shark must be one dam ingin chapter cutting in it was a saturday night and such a sabbath as followed ex officio professors of sabbath breaking are all whalemen the ivory pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble every sailor a butcher you would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods in the first place the enormous cutting tackles among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green and which no single man can possibly liftthis vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the maintop and firmly lashed to the lower masthead the strongest point anywhere above a ships deck the end of the hawserlike rope winding through these intricacies was then conducted to the windlass and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale to this block the great blubber hook weighing some one hundred pounds was attached and now suspended in stages over the side starbuck and stubb the mates armed with their long spades began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two sidefins this done a broad semicircular line is cut round the hole the hook is inserted and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass when instantly the entire ship careens over on her side every bolt in her starts like the nailheads of an old house in frosty weather she trembles quivers and nods her frighted mastheads to the sky more and more she leans over to the whale while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows till at last a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it for the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the scarf simultaneously cut by the spades of starbuck and stubb the mates and just as fast as it is thus peeled off and indeed by that very act itself it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the maintop the men at the windlass then cease heaving and for a moment or two the prodigious blooddripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard one of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long keen weapon called a boardingsword and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass into this hole the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber in order to prepare for what follows whereupon this accomplished swordsman warning all hands to stand off once more makes a scientific dash at the mass and with a few sidelong desperate lunging slicings severs it completely in twain so that while the short lower part is still fast the long upper strip called a blanketpiece swings clear and is all ready for lowering the heavers forward now resume their song and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other is slowly slackened away and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the blubberroom into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanketpiece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents and thus the work proceeds the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heavers singing the blubberroom gentlemen coiling the mates scarfing the ship straining and all hands swearing occasionally by way of assuaging the general friction chapter the blanket i have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skin of the whale i have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat and learned naturalists ashore my original opinion remains unchanged but it is only an opinion the question is what and where is the skin of the whale already you know what his blubber is that blubber is something of the consistence of firm closegrained beef but tougher more elastic and compact and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness now however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creatures skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whales body but that same blubber and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal if reasonably dense what can that be but the skin true from the unmarred dead body of the whale you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin transparent substance somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin that is previous to being dried when it not only contracts and thickens but becomes rather hard and brittle i have several such dried bits which i use for marks in my whalebooks it is transparent as i said before and being laid upon the printed page i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence at any rate it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles as you may say but what i am driving at here is this that same infinitely thin isinglass substance which i admit invests the entire body of the whale is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature as the skin of the skin so to speak for it were simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a newborn child but no more of this assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin as in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil and when it is considered that in quantity or rather weight that oil in its expressed state is only three fourths and not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that reckoning ten barrels to the ton you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whales skin in life the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and recrossed with numberless straight marks in thick array something like those in the finest italian line engravings but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned but seem to be seen through it as if they were engraved upon the body itself nor is this all in some instances to the quick observant eye those linear marks as in a veritable engraving but afford the ground for far other delineations these are hieroglyphical that is if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion by my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular i was much struck with a plate representing the old indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the upper mississippi like those mystic rocks too the mysticmarked whale remains undecipherable this allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of another thing besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the sperm whale presents he not seldom displays the back and more especially his flanks effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratches altogether of an irregular random aspect i should say that those new england rocks on the seacoast which agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergsi should say that those rocks must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this particular it also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales for i have most remarked them in the large fullgrown bulls of the species a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale it has already been said that it is stript from him in long pieces called blanketpieces like most seaterms this one is very happy and significant for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane or still better an indian poncho slipt over his head and skirting his extremity it is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers in all seas times and tides what would become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icy seas of the north if unsupplied with his cosy surtout true other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters but these be it observed are your coldblooded lungless fish whose very bellies are refrigerators creatures that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire whereas like man the whale has lungs and warm blood freeze his blood and he dies how wonderful is it thenexcept after explanationthat this great monster to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man how wonderful that he should be found at home immersed to his lips for life in those arctic waters where when seamen fall overboard they are sometimes found months afterwards perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice as a fly is found glued in amber but more surprising is it to know as has been proved by experiment that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a borneo negro in summer it does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness oh man admire and model thyself after the whale do thou too remain warm among ice do thou too live in this world without being of it be cool at the equator keep thy blood fluid at the pole like the great dome of st peters and like the great whale retain o man in all seasons a temperature of thine own but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things of erections how few are domed like st peters of creatures how few vast as the whale chapter the funeral haul in the chains let the carcase go astern the vast tackles have now done their duty the peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre though changed in hue it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk it is still colossal slowly it floats more and more away the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale the vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship and every rod that it so floats what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls augment the murderous din for hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair face of the pleasant sea wafted by the joyous breezes that great mass of death floats on and on till lost in infinite perspectives theres a most doleful and most mocking funeral the seavultures all in pious mourning the airsharks all punctiliously in black or speckled in life but few of them would have helped the whale i ween if peradventure he had needed it but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce oh horrible vultureism of earth from which not the mightiest whale is free nor is this the end desecrated as the body is a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare espied by some timid manofwar or blundering discoveryvessel from afar when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun and the white spray heaving high against it straightway the whales unharming corpse with trembling fingers is set down in the log_shoals rocks and breakers hereabouts beware_ and for years afterwards perhaps ships shun the place leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held theres your law of precedents theres your utility of traditions theres the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth and now not even hovering in the air theres orthodoxy thus while in life the great whales body may have been a real terror to his foes in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world are you a believer in ghosts my friend there are other ghosts than the cocklane one and far deeper men than doctor johnson who believe in them chapter the sphynx it should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan he was beheaded now the beheading of the sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reason consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck on the contrary where his head and body seem to join there in that very place is the thickest part of him remember also that the surgeon must operate from above some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea bear in mind too that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner without so much as getting one single peep into the evercontracting gash thus made he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdicted parts and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull do you not marvel then at stubbs boast that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale when first severed the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped that done if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of but with a full grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm whales head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk and completely to suspend such a burden as that even by the immense tackles of a whaler this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jewellers scales the pequods whale being decapitated and the body stripped the head was hoisted against the ships sideabout half way out of the sea so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element and there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower masthead and every yardarm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves there that blooddripping head hung to the pequods waist like the giant holoferness from the girdle of judith when this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamen went below to their dinner silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck an intense copper calm like a universal yellow lotus was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea a short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness came ahab alone from his cabin taking a few turns on the quarterdeck he paused to gaze over the side then slowly getting into the mainchains he took stubbs long spadestill remaining there after the whales decapitationand striking it into the lower part of the halfsuspended mass placed its other end crutchwise under one arm and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head it was a black and hooded head and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm it seemed the sphynxs in the desert speak thou vast and venerable head muttered ahab which though ungarnished with a beard yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses speak mighty head and tell us the secret thing that is in thee of all divers thou hast dived the deepest that head upon which the upper sun now gleams has moved amid this worlds foundations where unrecorded names and navies rust and untold hopes and anchors rot where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned there in that awful waterland there was thy most familiar home thou hast been where bell or diver never went hast slept by many a sailors side where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down thou sawst the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave true to each other when heaven seemed false to them thou sawst the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw and his murderers still sailed on unharmedwhile swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched longing arms o head thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of abraham and not one syllable is thine sail ho cried a triumphant voice from the mainmasthead aye well now thats cheering cried ahab suddenly erecting himself while whole thunderclouds swept aside from his brow that lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better manwhere away three points on the starboard bow sir and bringing down her breeze to us better and better man would now st paul would come along that way and to my breezelessness bring his breeze o nature and o soul of man how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter but has its cunning duplicate in mind chapter the jeroboams story hand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came faster than the ship and soon the pequod began to rock by and by through the glass the strangers boats and manned mastheads proved her a whaleship but as she was so far to windward and shooting by apparently making a passage to some other ground the pequod could not hope to reach her so the signal was set to see what response would be made here be it said that like the vessels of military marines the ships of the american whale fleet have each a private signal all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached every captain is provided with it thereby the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean even at considerable distances and with no small facility the pequods signal was at last responded to by the strangers setting her own which proved the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket squaring her yards she bore down ranged abeam under the pequods lee and lowered a boat it soon drew nigh but as the sideladder was being rigged by starbucks order to accommodate the visiting captain the stranger in question waved his hand from his boats stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary it turned out that the jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board and that mayhew her captain was fearful of infecting the pequods company for though himself and boats crew remained untainted and though his ship was half a rifleshot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the pequod but this did by no means prevent all communications preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship the jeroboams boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the pequod as she heavily forged through the sea for by this time it blew very fresh with her maintopsail aback though indeed at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave the boat would be pushed some way ahead but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again subject to this and other the like interruptions now and then a conversation was sustained between the two parties but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort pulling an oar in the jeroboams boat was a man of a singular appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities he was a small short youngish man sprinkled all over his face with freckles and wearing redundant yellow hair a longskirted cabalisticallycut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists a deep settled fanatic delirium was in his eyes so soon as this figure had been first descried stubb had exclaimedthats he thats hethe longtogged scaramouch the townhos company told us of stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some time previous when the pequod spoke the townho according to this account and what was subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the jeroboam his story was this he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna shakers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trapdoor announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial which he carried in his vestpocket but which instead of containing gunpowder was supposed to be charged with laudanum a strange apostolic whim having seized him he had left neskyeuna for nantucket where with that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumed a steady commonsense exterior and offered himself as a greenhand candidate for the jeroboams whaling voyage they engaged him but straightway upon the ships getting out of sight of land his insanity broke out in a freshet he announced himself as the archangel gabriel and commanded the captain to jump overboard he published his manifesto whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicargeneral of all oceanica the unflinching earnestness with which he declared these thingsthe dark daring play of his sleepless excited imagination and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium united to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness moreover they were afraid of him as such a man however was not of much practical use in the ship especially as he refused to work except when he pleased the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him but apprised that that individuals intention was to land him in the first convenient port the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vialsdevoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition in case this intention was carried out so strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if gabriel was sent from the ship not a man of them would remain he was therefore forced to relinquish his plan nor would they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what he would so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship the consequence of all this was that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates and since the epidemic had broken out he carried a higher hand than ever declaring that the plague as he called it was at his sole command nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure the sailors mostly poor devils cringed and some of them fawned before him in obedience to his instructions sometimes rendering him personal homage as to a god such things may seem incredible but however wondrous they are true nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the measureless selfdeception of the fanatic himself as his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others but it is time to return to the pequod i fear not thy epidemic man said ahab from the bulwarks to captain mayhew who stood in the boats stern come on board but now gabriel started to his feet think think of the fevers yellow and bilious beware of the horrible plague gabriel gabriel cried captain mayhew thou must either but that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and its seethings drowned all speech hast thou seen the white whale demanded ahab when the boat drifted back think think of thy whaleboat stoven and sunk beware of the horrible tail i tell thee again gabriel that but again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends nothing was said for some moments while a succession of riotous waves rolled by which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling not heaving it meantime the hoisted sperm whales head jogged about very violently and gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant when this interlude was over captain mayhew began a dark story concerning moby dick not however without frequent interruptions from gabriel whenever his name was mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home when upon speaking a whaleship her people were reliably apprised of the existence of moby dick and the havoc he had made greedily sucking in this intelligence gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the white whale in case the monster should be seen in his gibbering insanity pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than the shaker god incarnated the shakers receiving the bible but when some year or two afterwards moby dick was fairly sighted from the mastheads macey the chief mate burned with ardour to encounter him and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity despite all the archangels denunciations and forewarnings macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat with them he pushed off and after much weary pulling and many perilous unsuccessful onsets he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast meantime gabriel ascending to the mainroyal masthead was tossing one arm in frantic gestures and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity now while macey the mate was standing up in his boats bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a broad white shadow rose from the sea by its quick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen next instant the luckless mate so full of furious life was smitten bodily into the air and making a long arc in his descent fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards not a chip of the boat was harmed nor a hair of any oarsmans head but the mate for ever sank it is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in the spermwhale fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any sometimes nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated oftener the boats bow is knocked off or the thighboard in which the headsman stands is torn from its place and accompanies the body but strangest of all is the circumstance that in more instances than one when the body has been recovered not a single mark of violence is discernible the man being stark dead the whole calamity with the falling form of macey was plainly descried from the ship raising a piercing shriekthe vial the vial gabriel called off the terrorstricken crew from the further hunting of the whale this terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically foreannounced it instead of only making a general prophecy which any one might have done and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed he became a nameless terror to the ship mayhew having concluded his narration ahab put such questions to him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer to which ahab answeredaye straightway then gabriel once more started to his feet glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed with downward pointed fingerthink think of the blasphemerdead and down therebeware of the blasphemers end ahab stolidly turned aside then said to mayhew captain i have just bethought me of my letterbag there is a letter for one of thy officers if i mistake not starbuck look over the bag every whaleship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans thus most letters never reach their mark and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand it was sorely tumbled damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin of such a letter death himself might well have been the postboy canst not read it cried ahab give it me man aye aye its but a dim scrawlwhats this as he was studying it out starbuck took a long cuttingspade pole and with his knife slightly split the end to insert the letter there and in that way hand it to the boat without its coming any closer to the ship meantime ahab holding the letter muttered mr haryes mr harrya womans pinny handthe mans wife ill wagerayemr harry macey ship jeroboamwhy its macey and hes dead poor fellow poor fellow and from his wife sighed mayhew but let me have it nay keep it thyself cried gabriel to ahab thou art soon going that way curses throttle thee yelled ahab captain mayhew stand by now to receive it and taking the fatal missive from starbucks hands he caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards the boat but as he did so the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing the boat drifted a little towards the ships stern so that as if by magic the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriels eager hand he clutched it in an instant seized the boatknife and impaling the letter on it sent it thus loaded back into the ship it fell at ahabs feet then gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the pequod as after this interlude the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair chapter the monkeyrope in the tumultuous business of cuttingin and attending to a whale there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew now hands are wanted here and then again hands are wanted there there is no staying in any one place for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere it is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene we must now retrace our way a little it was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whales back the blubberhook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole it was inserted there by my particular friend queequeg whose duty it was as harpooneer to descend upon the monsters back for the special purpose referred to but in very many cases circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded the whale be it observed lies almost entirely submerged excepting the immediate parts operated upon so down there some ten feet below the level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounders about half on the whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolves like a treadmill beneath him on the occasion in question queequeg figured in the highland costumea shirt and socksin which to my eyes at least he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a better chance to observe him as will presently be seen being the savages bowsman that is the person who pulled the bowoar in his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hardscrabble scramble upon the dead whales back you have seen italian organboys holding a dancingape by a long cord just so from the ships steep side did i hold queequeg down there in the sea by what is technically called in the fishery a monkeyrope attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist it was a humorously perilous business for both of us for before we proceed further it must be said that the monkeyrope was fast at both ends fast to queequegs broad canvas belt and fast to my narrow leather one so that for better or for worse we two for the time were wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then both usage and honor demanded that instead of cutting the cord it should drag me down in his wake so then an elongated siamese ligature united us queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother nor could i any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then that while earnestly watching his motions i seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two that my free will had received a mortal wound and that anothers mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death therefore i saw that here was a sort of interregnum in providence for its evenhanded equity never could have so gross an injustice and yet still further ponderingwhile i jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam himstill further pondering i say i saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in most cases he one way or other has this siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals if your banker breaks you snap if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills you die true you may say that by exceeding caution you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life but handle queequegs monkeyrope heedfully as i would sometimes he jerked it so that i came very near sliding overboard nor could i possibly forget that do what i would i only had the management of one end of it the monkeyrope is found in all whalers but it was only in the pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together this improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than stubb in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkeyrope holder i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the whale and the shipwhere he would occasionally fall from the incessant rolling and swaying of both but this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcassthe rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive and right in among those sharks was queequeg who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet a thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man nevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them accordingly besides the monkeyrope with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious sharkhe was provided with still another protection suspended over the side in one of the stages tashtego and daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whalespades wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach this procedure of theirs to be sure was very disinterested and benevolent of them they meant queequegs best happiness i admit but in their hasty zeal to befriend him and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the bloodmuddled water those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail but poor queequeg i suppose straining and gasping there with that great iron hookpoor queequeg i suppose only prayed to his yojo and gave up his life into the hands of his gods well well my dear comrade and twinbrother thought i as i drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the seawhat matters it after all are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world that unsounded ocean you gasp in is life those sharks your foes those spades your friends and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad but courage there is good cheer in store for you queequeg for now as with blue lips and bloodshot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side the steward advances and with a benevolent consolatory glance hands himwhat some hot cognac no hands him ye gods hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water ginger do i smell ginger suspiciously asked stubb coming near yes this must be ginger peering into the as yet untasted cup then standing as if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying ginger ginger and will you have the goodness to tell me mr doughboy where lies the virtue of ginger ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use doughboy to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal gingerwhat the devil is ginger seacoal firewoodlucifer matchestindergunpowderwhat the devil is ginger i say that you offer this cup to our poor queequeg here there is some sneaking temperance society movement about this business he suddenly added now approaching starbuck who had just come from forward will you look at that kannakin sir smell of it if you please then watching the mates countenance he added the steward mr starbuck had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to queequeg there this instant off the whale is the steward an apothecary sir and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a halfdrowned man i trust not said starbuck it is poor stuff enough aye aye steward cried stubb well teach you to drug a harpooneer none of your apothecarys medicine here you want to poison us do ye you have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all and pocket the proceeds do ye it was not me cried doughboy it was aunt charity that brought the ginger on board and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits but only this gingerjubso she called it gingerjub you gingerly rascal take that and run along with ye to the lockers and get something better i hope i do no wrong mr starbuck it is the captains ordersgrog for the harpooneer on a whale enough replied starbuck only dont hit him again but oh i never hurt when i hit except when i hit a whale or something of that sort and this fellows a weazel what were you about saying sir only this go down with him and get what thou wantest thyself when stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort of teacaddy in the other the first contained strong spirits and was handed to queequeg the second was aunt charitys gift and that was freely given to the waves chapter stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have a talk over him it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whales prodigious head hanging to the pequods side but we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it for the present other matters press and the best we can do now for the head is to pray heaven the tackles may hold now during the past night and forenoon the pequod had gradually drifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow brit gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales a species of the leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near and though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures and though the pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all and though she had passed numbers of them near the crozetts without lowering a boat yet now that a sperm whale had been brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all the announcement was made that a right whale should be captured that day if opportunity offered nor was this long wanting tall spouts were seen to leeward and two boats stubbs and flasks were detached in pursuit pulling further and further away they at last became almost invisible to the men at the masthead but suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast an interval passed and the boats were in plain sight in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in a maelstrom within three rods of the planks he wholly disappeared from view as if diving under the keel cut cut was the cry from the ship to the boats which for one instant seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessels side but having plenty of line yet in the tubs and the whale not sounding very rapidly they paid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship for a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction and still plied their oars in another the contending strain threatened to take them under but it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain and they stuck to it till they did gain it when instantly a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel as the strained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose to view under her bows snapping and quivering and so flinging off its drippings that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water while the whale beyond also rose to sight and once more the boats were free to fly but the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him so that they performed a complete circuit meantime they hauled more and more upon their lines till close flanking him on both sides stubb answered flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the pequod the battle went while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whales body rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirstily drinking at every new gash as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock at last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit he turned upon his back a corpse while the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing some conversation ensued between them i wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard said stubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan wants with it said flask coiling some spare line in the boats bow did you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whales head hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a right whales on the larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship can never afterwards capsize why not i dont know but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so and he seems to know all about ships charms but i sometimes think hell charm the ship to no good at last i dont half like that chap stubb did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snakes head stubb sink him i never look at him at all but if ever i get a chance of a dark night and he standing hard by the bulwarks and no one by look down there flaskpointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both handsaye will i flask i take that fedallah to be the devil in disguise do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship hes the devil i say the reason why you dont see his tail is because he tucks it up out of sight he carries it coiled away in his pocket i guess blast him now that i think of it hes always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots he sleeps in his boots dont he he hasnt got any hammock but ive seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging no doubt and its because of his cursed tail he coils it down do ye see in the eye of the rigging whats the old man have so much to do with him for striking up a swap or a bargain i suppose bargainabout what why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that white whale and the devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap away his silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then hell surrender moby dick pooh stubb you are skylarking how can fedallah do that i dont know flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked one i tell ye why they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flagship once switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor was at home well he was at home and asked the devil what he wanted the devil switching his hoofs up and says i want john what for says the old governor what business is that of yours says the devil getting madi want to use him take him says the governorand by the lord flask if the devil didnt give john the asiatic cholera before he got through with him ill eat this whale in one mouthful but look sharpaint you all ready there well then pull ahead and lets get the whale alongside i think i remember some such story as you were telling said flask when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship but i cant remember where three spaniards adventures of those three bloodyminded soldadoes did ye read it there flask i guess ye did no never saw such a book heard of it though but now tell me stubb do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now was the same you say is now on board the pequod am i the same man that helped kill this whale doesnt the devil live for ever who ever heard that the devil was dead did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil and if the devil has a latchkey to get into the admirals cabin dont you suppose he can crawl into a porthole tell me that mr flask how old do you suppose fedallah is stubb do you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship well thats the figure one now take all the hoops in the pequods hold and string along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that wouldnt begin to be fedallahs age nor all the coopers in creation couldnt show hoops enough to make oughts enough but see here stubb i thought you a little boasted just now that you meant to give fedallah a seatoss if you got a good chance now if hes so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he is going to live for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboardtell me that give him a good ducking anyhow but hed crawl back duck him again and keep ducking him suppose he should take it into his head to duck you thoughyes and drown youwhat then i should like to see him try it id give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldnt dare to show his face in the admirals cabin again for a long while let alone down in the orlop there where he lives and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much damn the devil flask so you suppose im afraid of the devil whos afraid of him except the old governor who daresnt catch him and put him in doubledarbies as he deserves but lets him go about kidnapping people aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil kidnapped hed roast for him theres a governor do you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahab do i suppose it youll know it before long flask but i am going now to keep a sharp lookout on him and if i see anything very suspicious going on ill just take him by the nape of his neck and saylook here beelzebub you dont do it and if he makes any fuss by the lord ill make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstan and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will come short off at the stumpdo you see and then i rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion hell sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs and what will you do with the tail stubb do with it sell it for an ox whip when we get homewhat else now do you mean what you say and have been saying all along stubb mean or not mean here we are at the ship the boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard side where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him didnt i tell you so said flask yes youll soon see this right whales head hoisted up opposite that parmacettis in good time flasks saying proved true as before the pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whales head now by the counterpoise of both heads she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may well believe so when on one side you hoist in lockes head you go over that way but now on the other side hoist in kants and you come back again but in very poor plight thus some minds for ever keep trimming boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunderheads overboard and then you will float light and right in disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the ship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crownpiece but nothing like this in the present case had been done the carcases of both whales had dropped astern and the headladen ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers meantime fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whales head and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand and ahab chanced so to stand that the parsee occupied his shadow while if the parsees shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with and lengthen ahabs as the crew toiled on laplandish speculations were bandied among them concerning all these passing things chapter the sperm whales headcontrasted view here now are two great whales laying their heads together let us join them and lay together our own of the grand order of folio leviathans the sperm whale and the right whale are by far the most noteworthy they are the only whales regularly hunted by man to the nantucketer they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale as the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the pequods side and as we may freely go from one to the other by merely stepping across the deckwhere i should like to know will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here in the first place you are struck by the general contrast between these heads both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whales which the right whales sadly lacks there is more character in the sperm whales head as you behold it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him in point of pervading dignity in the present instance too this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit giving token of advanced age and large experience in short he is what the fishermen technically call a greyheaded whale let us now note what is least dissimilar in these headsnamely the two most important organs the eye and the ear far back on the side of the head and low down near the angle of either whales jaw if you narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would fancy to be a young colts eye so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head now from this peculiar sideway position of the whales eyes it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no more than he can one exactly astern in a word the position of the whales eyes corresponds to that of a mans ears and you may fancy for yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey objects through your ears you would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight sideline of sight and about thirty more behind it if your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad day you would not be able to see him any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind in a word you would have two backs so to speak but at the same time also two fronts side fronts for what is it that makes the front of a manwhat indeed but his eyes moreover while in most other animals that i can now think of the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiar position of the whales eyes effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys this of course must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts the whale therefore must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct picture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him man may in effect be said to look out on the world from a sentrybox with two joined sashes for his window but with the whale these two sashes are separately inserted making two distinct windows but sadly impairing the view this peculiarity of the whales eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the leviathan but i must be content with a hint so long as a mans eyes are open in the light the act of seeing is involuntary that is he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him nevertheless any ones experience will teach him that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively and completely to examine any two thingshowever large or however smallat one and the same instant of time never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other but if you now come to separate these two objects and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in order to see one of them in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness how is it then with the whale true both his eyes in themselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much more comprehensive combining and subtle than mans that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects one on one side of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction if he can then is it as marvellous a thing in him as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in euclid nor strictly investigated is there any incongruity in this comparison it may be but an idle whim but it has always seemed to me that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats the timidity and liability to queer frights so common to such whales i think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye if you are an entire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two heads for hours and never discover that organ the ear has no external leaf whatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill so wondrously minute is it it is lodged a little behind the eye with respect to their ears this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right while the ear of the former has an external opening that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from without is it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hares but if his eyes were broad as the lens of herschels great telescope and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals would that make him any longer of sight or sharper of hearing not at allwhy then do you try to enlarge your mind subtilize it let us now with whatever levers and steamengines we have at hand cant over the sperm whales head that it may lie bottom up then ascending by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach but let us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are what a really beautiful and chastelooking mouth from floor to ceiling lined or rather papered with a glistening white membrane glossy as bridal satins but come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuffbox with the hinge at one end instead of one side if you pry it up so as to get it overhead and expose its rows of teeth it seems a terrific portcullis and such alas it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force but far more terrible is it to behold when fathoms down in the sea you see some sulky whale floating there suspended with his prodigious jaw some fifteen feet long hanging straight down at rightangles with his body for all the world like a ships jibboom this whale is not dead he is only dispirited out of sorts perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight a reproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lockjaws upon him in most cases this lower jawbeing easily unhinged by a practised artistis disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles including canes umbrellastocks and handles to ridingwhips with a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were an anchor and when the proper time comessome few days after the other workqueequeg daggoo and tashtego being all accomplished dentists are set to drawing teeth with a keen cuttingspade queequeg lances the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle being rigged from aloft they drag out these teeth as michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands there are generally fortytwo teeth in all in old whales much worn down but undecayed nor filled after our artificial fashion the jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs and piled away like joists for building houses chapter the right whales headcontrasted view crossing the deck let us now have a good long look at the right whales head as in general shape the noble sperm whales head may be compared to a roman warchariot especially in front where it is so broadly rounded so at a broad view the right whales head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliottoed shoe two hundred years ago an old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemakers last and in this same last or shoe that old woman of the nursery tale with the swarming brood might very comfortably be lodged she and all her progeny but as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects according to your point of view if you stand on its summit and look at these two fshaped spoutholes you would take the whole head for an enormous bassviol and these spiracles the apertures in its soundingboard then again if you fix your eye upon this strange crested comblike incrustation on the top of the massthis green barnacled thing which the greenlanders call the crown and the southern fishers the bonnet of the right whale fixing your eyes solely on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak with a birds nest in its crotch at any rate when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you unless indeed your fancy has been fixed by the technical term crown also bestowed upon it in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner but if this whale be a king he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem look at that hanging lower lip what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by carpenters measurement about twenty feet long and five feet deep a sulk and pout that will yield you some gallons of oil and more a great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be harelipped the fissure is about a foot across probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the peruvian coast when earthquakes caused the beach to gape over this lip as over a slippery threshold we now slide into the mouth upon my word were i at mackinaw i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam good lord is this the road that jonah went the roof is about twelve feet high and runs to a pretty sharp angle as if there were a regular ridgepole there while these ribbed arched hairy sides present us with those wondrous half vertical scimetarshaped slats of whalebone say three hundred on a side which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned the edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres through which the right whale strains the water and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time in the central blinds of bone as they stand in their natural order there are certain curious marks curves hollows and ridges whereby some whalemen calculate the creatures age as the age of an oak by its circular rings though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable yet it has the savor of analogical probability at any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable in old times there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these blinds one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous whiskers inside of the whales mouth another hogs bristles a third old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language there are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper _chop_ which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth this reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker or rather a moustache consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance as every one knows these same hogs bristles fins whiskers blinds or whatever you please furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances but in this particular the demand has long been on the decline it was in queen annes time that the bone was in its glory the farthingale being then all the fashion and as those ancient dames moved about gaily though in the jaws of the whale as you may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone but now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment and standing in the right whales mouth look around you afresh seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would you not think you were inside of the great haarlem organ and gazing upon its thousand pipes for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest turkeythe tongue which is glued as it were to the floor of the mouth it is very fat and tender and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck this particular tongue now before us at a passing glance i should say it was a sixbarreler that is it will yield you about that amount of oil ere this you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started withthat the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely different heads to sum up then in the right whales there is no great well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible of a lower jaw like the sperm whales nor in the sperm whale are there any of those blinds of bone no huge lower lip and scarcely anything of a tongue again the right whale has two external spoutholes the sperm whale only one look your last now on these venerable hooded heads while they yet lie together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea the other will not be very long in following can you catch the expression of the sperm whales there it is the same he died with only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away i think his broad brow to be full of a prairielike placidity born of a speculative indifference as to death but mark the other heads expression see that amazing lower lip pressed by accident against the vessels side so as firmly to embrace the jaw does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death this right whale i take to have been a stoic the sperm whale a platonian who might have taken up spinoza in his latter years chapter the batteringram ere quitting for the nonce the sperm whales head i would have you as a sensible physiologist simplyparticularly remark its front aspect in all its compacted collectedness i would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatever batteringram power may be lodged there here is a vital point for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling but not the less true events perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boomlike lower jaw you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head much in the same way indeed as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose and that what nose he hashis spout holeis on the top of his head you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head nearly one third of his entire length from the front wherefore you must now have perceived that the front of the sperm whales head is a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever furthermore you are now to consider that only in the extreme lower backward sloping part of the front of the head is there the slightest vestige of bone and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development so that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad finally though as will soon be revealed its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy in some previous place i have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale as the rind wraps an orange just so with the head but with this difference about the head this envelope though not so thick is of a boneless toughness inestimable by any man who has not handled it the severest pointed harpoon the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm impotently rebounds from it it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horses hoofs i do not think that any sensation lurks in it bethink yourself also of another thing when two large loaded indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks what do the sailors do they do not suspend between them at the point of coming contact any merely hard substance like iron or wood no they hold there a large round wad of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest and toughest of oxhide that bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crowbars by itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at but supplementary to this it has hypothetically occurred to me that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them capable at will of distension or contraction and as the sperm whale as far as i know has no such provision in him considering too the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope considering the unique interior of his head it has hypothetically occurred to me i say that those mystical lungcelled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction if this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that might to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes now mark unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurable wall and this most buoyant thing within there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimated as piled wood isby the cord and all obedient to one volition as the smallest insect so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster when i shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats i trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though the sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien and mixed the atlantic with the pacific you would not elevate one hair of your eyebrow for unless you own the whale you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth but clear truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter how small the chances for the provincials then what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddesss veil at lais chapter the great heidelburgh tun now comes the baling of the case but to comprehend it aright you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon regarding the sperm whales head as a solid oblong you may on an inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof the lower is the bony structure forming the cranium and jaws and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale at the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have two almost equal parts which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance quoin is not a euclidean term it belongs to the pure nautical mathematics i know not that it has been defined before a quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both sides the lower subdivided part called the junk is one immense honeycomb of oil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousand infiltrated cells of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent the upper part known as the case may be regarded as the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale and as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front so the whales vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun moreover as that of heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages namely the highlyprized spermaceti in its absolutely pure limpid and odoriferous state nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature though in life it remains perfectly fluid yet upon exposure to the air after death it soon begins to concrete sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water a large whales case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm though from unavoidable circumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks and dribbles away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun was coated within but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearlcoloured membrane like the lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface of the sperm whales case it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head and sinceas has been elsewhere set forththe head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale you have more than twentysix feet for the depth of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ships side as in decapitating the whale the operators instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine he has therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents it is this decapitated end of the head also which is at last elevated out of the water and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles whose hempen combinations on one side make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter thus much being said attend now i pray you to that marvellous andin this particular instancealmost fatal operation whereby the sperm whales great heidelburgh tun is tapped chapter cistern and buckets nimble as a cat tashtego mounts aloft and without altering his erect posture runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyardarm to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun he has carried with him a light tackle called a whip consisting of only two parts travelling through a singlesheaved block securing this block so that it hangs down from the yardarm he swings one end of the rope till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck then handoverhand down the other part the indian drops through the air till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head therestill high elevated above the rest of the company to whom he vivaciously crieshe seems some turkish muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower a shorthandled sharp spade being sent up to him he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun in this business he proceeds very heedfully like a treasurehunter in some old house sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in by the time this cautious search is over a stout ironbound bucket precisely like a wellbucket has been attached to one end of the whip while the other end being stretched across the deck is there held by two or three alert hands these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian to whom another person has reached up a very long pole inserting this pole into the bucket tashtego downward guides the bucket into the tun till it entirely disappears then giving the word to the seamen at the whip up comes the bucket again all bubbling like a dairymaids pail of new milk carefully lowered from its height the fullfreighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand and quickly emptied into a large tub then remounting aloft it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more towards the end tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder and deeper and deeper into the tun until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down now the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm when all at once a queer accident happened whether it was that tashtego that wild indian was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his onehanded hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy or whether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so without stating his particular reasons how it was exactly there is no telling now but on a sudden as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly upmy god poor tashtegolike the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well dropped headforemost down into this great tun of heidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling went clean out of sight man overboard cried daggoo who amid the general consternation first came to his senses swing the bucket this way and putting one foot into it so as the better to secure his slippery handhold on the whip itself the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head almost before tashtego could have reached its interior bottom meantime there was a terrible tumult looking over the side they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea as if that moment seized with some momentous idea whereas it was only the poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk at this instant while daggoo on the summit of the head was clearing the whipwhich had somehow got foul of the great cutting tacklesa sharp cracking noise was heard and to the unspeakable horror of all one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg the one remaining hook upon which the entire strain now depended seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head come down come down yelled the seamen to daggoo but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles so that if the head should drop he would still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul line rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted out in heavens name man cried stubb are you ramming home a cartridge thereavast how will that help him jamming that ironbound bucket on top of his head avast will ye stand clear of the tackle cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket almost in the same instant with a thunderboom the enormous mass dropped into the sea like niagaras tablerock into the whirlpool the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glittering copper and all caught their breath as half swingingnow over the sailors heads and now over the waterdaggoo through a thick mist of spray was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles while poor buriedalive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea but hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away when a naked figure with a boardingsword in his hand was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks the next a loud splash announced that my brave queequeg had dived to the rescue one packed rush was made to the side and every eye counted every ripple as moment followed moment and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen some hands now jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a little off from the ship ha ha cried daggoo all at once from his now quiet swinging perch overhead and looking further off from the side we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves a sight strange to see as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave both bothit is bothcried daggoo again with a joyful shout and soon after queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand and with the other clutching the long hair of the indian drawn into the waiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but tashtego was long in coming to and queequeg did not look very brisk now how had this noble rescue been accomplished why diving after the slowly descending head queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there then dropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards and so hauled out poor tash by the head he averred that upon first thrusting in for him a leg was presented but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be and might occasion great troublehe had thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss had wrought a somerset upon the indian so that with the next trial he came forth in the good old wayhead foremost as for the great head itself that was doing as well as could be expected and thus through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of queequeg the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego was successfully accomplished in the teeth too of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing riding and rowing i know that this queer adventure of the gayheaders will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some ones falling into a cistern ashore an accident which not seldom happens and with much less reason too than the indians considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the sperm whales well but peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this we thought the tissued infiltrated head of the sperm whale was the lightest and most corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself we have thee there not at all but i have ye for at the time poor tash fell in the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the wella double welded hammered substance as i have before said much heavier than the sea water and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost but the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed affording queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run as you may say yes it was a running delivery so it was now had tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious perishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale only one sweeter end can readily be recalledthe delicious death of an ohio honeyhunter who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree found such exceeding store of it that leaning too far over it sucked him in so that he died embalmed how many think ye have likewise fallen into platos honey head and sweetly perished there chapter the prairie to scan the lines of his face or feel the bumps on the head of this leviathan this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist has as yet undertaken such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltar or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the pantheon still in that famous work of his lavater not only treats of the various faces of men but also attentively studies the faces of horses birds serpents and fish and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein nor have gall and his disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man therefore though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application of these two semisciences to the whale i will do my endeavor i try all things i achieve what i can physiognomically regarded the sperm whale is an anomalous creature he has no proper nose and since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression hence it would seem that its entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affect the countenance of the whale for as in landscape gardening a spire cupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated openwork belfry of the nose dash the nose from phidiass marble jove and what a sorry remainder nevertheless leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all his proportions are so stately that the same deficiency which in the sculptured jove were hideous in him is no blemish at all nay it is an added grandeur a nose to the whale would have been impertinent as on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jollyboat your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled a pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne in some particulars perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the sperm whale is that of the full front of his head this aspect is sublime in thought a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the morning in the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles the elephants brow is majestic human or animal the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the german emperors to their decrees it signifiesgod done this day by my hand but in most creatures nay in man himself very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line few are the foreheads which like shakespeares or melancthons rise so high and descend so low that the eyes themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lakes and all above them in the foreheads wrinkles you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink as the highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer but in the great sperm whale this high and mighty godlike dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature for you see no one point precisely not one distinct feature is revealed no nose eyes ears or mouth no face he has none proper nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead pleated with riddles dumbly lowering with the doom of boats and ships and men nor in profile does this wondrous brow diminish though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so in profile you plainly perceive that horizontal semicrescentic depression in the foreheads middle which in man is lavaters mark of genius but how genius in the sperm whale has the sperm whale ever written a book spoken a speech no his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it it is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale been known to the young orient world he would have been deified by their childmagian thoughts they deified the crocodile of the nile because the crocodile is tongueless and the sperm whale has no tongue or at least it is so exceedingly small as to be incapable of protrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure back to their birthright the merry mayday gods of old and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalted to joves high seat the great sperm whale shall lord it champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics but there is no champollion to decipher the egypt of every mans and every beings face physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing fable if then sir william jones who read in thirty languages could not read the simplest peasants face in its profounder and more subtle meanings how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee of the sperm whales brow i but put that brow before you read it if you can chapter the nut if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square in the fullgrown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length unhinge the lower jaw and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base but in lifeas we have elsewhere seenthis inclined plane is angularly filled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm at the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this craterin another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depthreposes the mere handful of this monsters brain the brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden away behind its vast outworks like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of quebec so like a choice casket is it secreted in him that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubicyards of his sperm magazine lying in strange folds courses and convolutions to their apprehensions it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence it is plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan in the creatures living intact state is an entire delusion as for his true brain you can then see no indications of it nor feel any the whale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to the common world if you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end which is the high end you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and from the same point of view indeed place this reversed skull scaled down to the human magnitude among a plate of mens skulls and you would involuntarily confound it with them and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit in phrenological phrase you would saythis man had no selfesteem and no veneration and by those negations considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power you can best form to yourself the truest though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is but if from the comparative dimensions of the whales proper brain you deem it incapable of being adequately charted then i have another idea for you if you attentively regard almost any quadrupeds spine you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper it is a german conceit that the vertebræ are absolutely undeveloped skulls but the curious external resemblance i take it the germans were not the first men to perceive a foreign friend once pointed it out to me in the skeleton of a foe he had slain and with the vertebræ of which he was inlaying in a sort of bassorelievo the beaked prow of his canoe now i consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal for i believe that much of a mans character will be found betokened in his backbone i would rather feel your spine than your skull whoever you are a thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul i rejoice in my spine as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to the world apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale his cranial cavity is continuous with the first neckvertebra and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across being eight in height and of a triangular figure with the base downwards as it passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity now of course this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substancethe spinal cordas the brain and directly communicates with the brain and what is still more for many feet after emerging from the brains cavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost equal to that of the brain under all these circumstances would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whales spine phrenologically for viewed in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord but leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists i would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the sperm whales hump this august hump if i mistake not rises over one of the larger vertebræ and is therefore in some sort the outer convex mould of it from its relative situation then i should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm whale and that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have reason to know chapter the pequod meets the virgin the predestinated day arrived and we duly met the ship jungfrau derick de deer master of bremen at one time the greatest whaling people in the world the dutch and germans are now among the least but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude you still occasionally meet with their flag in the pacific for some reason the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects while yet some distance from the pequod she rounded to and dropping a boat her captain was impelled towards us impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern what has he in his hand there cried starbuck pointing to something wavingly held by the german impossiblea lampfeeder not that said stubb no no its a coffeepot mr starbuck hes coming off to make us our coffee is the yarman dont you see that big tin can there alongside of himthats his boiling water oh hes all right is the yarman go along with you cried flask its a lampfeeder and an oilcan hes out of oil and has come abegging however curious it may seem for an oilship to be borrowing oil on the whaleground and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happens and in the present case captain derick de deer did indubitably conduct a lampfeeder as flask did declare as he mounted the deck ahab abruptly accosted him without at all heeding what he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the german soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale immediately turning the conversation to his lampfeeder and oil can with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darknesshis last drop of bremen oil being gone and not a single flyingfish yet captured to supply the deficiency concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the fishery is technically called a _clean_ one that is an empty one well deserving the name of jungfrau or the virgin his necessities supplied derick departed but he had not gained his ships side when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mastheads of both vessels and so eager for the chase was derick that without pausing to put his oilcan and lampfeeder aboard he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lampfeeders now the game having risen to leeward he and the other three german boats that soon followed him had considerably the start of the pequods keels there were eight whales an average pod aware of their danger they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness they left a great wide wake as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea full in this rapid wake and many fathoms in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him seemed afflicted with the jaundice or some other infirmity whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance seemed questionable for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social nevertheless he stuck to their wake though indeed their back water must have retarded him because the whitebone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet his spout was short slow and laborious coming forth with a choking sort of gush and spending itself in torn shreds followed by strange subterranean commotions in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity causing the waters behind him to upbubble whos got some paregoric said stubb he has the stomachache im afraid lord think of having half an acre of stomachache adverse winds are holding mad christmas in him boys its the first foul wind i ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before it must be hes lost his tiller as an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses careens buries rolls and wallows on her way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous ribends expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin whether he had lost that fin in battle or had been born without it it were hard to say only wait a bit old chap and ill give ye a sling for that wounded arm cried cruel flask pointing to the whaleline near him mind he dont sling thee with it cried starbuck give way or the german will have him with one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish because not only was he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he was nearest to them and the other whales were going with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit for the time at this juncture the pequods keels had shot by the three german boats last lowered but from the great start he had had dericks boat still led the chase though every moment neared by his foreign rivals the only thing they feared was that from being already so nigh to his mark he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him as for derick he seemed quite confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lampfeeder at the other boats the ungracious and ungrateful dog cried starbuck he mocks and dares me with the very poorbox i filled for him not five minutes agothen in his old intense whispergive way greyhounds dog to it i tell ye what it is mencried stubb to his crewits against my religion to get mad but id like to eat that villainous yarmanpullwont ye are ye going to let that rascal beat ye do ye love brandy a hogshead of brandy then to the best man come why dont some of ye burst a bloodvessel whos that been dropping an anchor overboardwe dont budge an inchwere becalmed halloo heres grass growing in the boats bottomand by the lord the mast theres budding this wont do boys look at that yarman the short and long of it is men will ye spit fire or not oh see the suds he makes cried flask dancing up and downwhat a humpoh _do_ pile on the beeflays like a log oh my lads _do_ springslapjacks and quahogs for supper you know my ladsbaked clams and muffinsoh _do_ _do_ springhes a hundred barrellerdont lose him nowdont oh _dont_see that yarmanoh wont ye pull for your duff my ladssuch a sog such a sogger dont ye love sperm there goes three thousand dollars mena banka whole bank the bank of englandoh _do_ _do_ _do_whats that yarman about now at this moment derick was in the act of pitching his lampfeeder at the advancing boats and also his oilcan perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals way and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss the unmannerly dutch dogger cried stubb pull now men like fifty thousand lineofbattleship loads of redhaired devils what dye say tashtego are you the man to snap your spine in twoandtwenty pieces for the honor of old gayhead what dye say i say pull like goddamcried the indian fiercely but evenly incited by the taunts of the german the pequods three boats now began ranging almost abreast and so disposed momentarily neared him in that fine loose chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey the three mates stood up proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of there she slides now hurrah for the whiteash breeze down with the yarman sail over him but so decided an original start had derick had that spite of all their gallantry he would have proved the victor in this race had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman while this clumsy lubber was striving to free his whiteash and while in consequence dericks boat was nigh to capsizing and he thundering away at his men in a mighty ragethat was a good time for starbuck stubb and flask with a shout they took a mortal start forwards and slantingly ranged up on the germans quarter an instant more and all four boats were diagonically in the whales immediate wake while stretching from them on both sides was the foaming swell that he made it was a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight the whale was now going head out and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright now to this hand now to that he yawed in his faltering flight and still at every billow that he broke he spasmodically sank in the sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin so have i seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks but the bird has a voice and with plaintive cries will make known her fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea was chained up and enchanted in him he had no voice save that choking respiration through his spiracle and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable while still in his amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequods boats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart ere the last chance would for ever escape but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three tigersqueequeg tashtego daggooinstinctively sprang to their feet and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointed their barbs and darted over the head of the german harpooneer their three nantucket irons entered the whale blinding vapors of foam and whitefire the three boats in the first fury of the whales headlong rush bumped the germans aside with such force that both derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three flying keels dont be afraid my butterboxes cried stubb casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by yell be picked up presentlyall righti saw some sharks asternst bernards dogs you knowrelieve distressed travellers hurrah this is the way to sail now every keel a sunbeam hurrahhere we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar this puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plainmakes the wheelspokes fly boys when you fasten to him that way and theres danger of being pitched out too when you strike a hill hurrah this is the way a fellow feels when hes going to davy jonesall a rush down an endless inclined plane hurrah this whale carries the everlasting mail but the monsters run was a brief one giving a sudden gasp he tumultuously sounded with a grating rush the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines that using all their dexterous might they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on till at lastowing to the perpendicular strain from the leadlined chocks of the boats whence the three ropes went straight down into the bluethe gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water while the three sterns tilted high in the air and the whale soon ceasing to sound for some time they remained in that attitude fearful of expending more line though the position was a little ticklish but though boats have been taken down and lost in this way yet it is this holding on as it is called this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes yet not to speak of the peril of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken whale stays under water the more he is exhausted because owing to the enormous surface of himin a full grown sperm whale something less than square feetthe pressure of the water is immense we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under even here aboveground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean it must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres one whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty lineofbattle ships with all their guns and stores and men on board as the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down into its eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of any sort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths what landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and placidity the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock suspended and to what to three bits of board is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly saidcanst thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fishspears the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as straw the arrow cannot make him flee darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear this the creature this he oh that unfulfilments should follow the prophets for with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea to hide him from the pequods fishspears in that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half xerxes army who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head stand by men he stirs cried starbuck as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them as by magnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that every oarsman felt them in his seat the next moment relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards as a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea haul in haul in cried starbuck again hes rising the lines of which hardly an instant before not one hands breadth could have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within two ships lengths of the hunters his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion in most land animals there are certain valves or floodgates in many of their veins whereby when wounded the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions not so with the whale one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire nonvalvular structure of the bloodvessels so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him and so distant and numerous its interior fountains that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period even as in a drought a river will flow whose source is in the wellsprings of faroff and undiscernible hills even now when the boats pulled upon this whale and perilously drew over his swaying flukes and the lances were darted into him they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept continually playing while the natural spouthole in his head was only at intervals however rapid sending its affrighted moisture into the air from this last vent no blood yet came because no vital part of him had thus far been struck his life as they significantly call it was untouched as the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part of his form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainly revealed his eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were beheld as strange misgrown masses gather in the knotholes of the noblest oaks when prostrate so from the points which the whales eyes had once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to see but pity there was none for all his old age and his one arm and his blind eyes he must die the death and be murdered in order to light the gay bridals and other merrymakings of men and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all still rolling in his blood at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the flank a nice spot cried flask just let me prick him there once avast cried starbuck theres no need of that but humane starbuck was too late at the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift fury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore capsizing flasks boat and marring the bows it was his death stroke for by this time so spent was he by loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped fin then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up the white secrets of his belly lay like a log and died it was most piteous that last expiring spout as when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain and with halfstifled melancholy gurglings the spraycolumn lowers and lowers to the groundso the last long dying spout of the whale soon while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled immediately by starbucks orders lines were secured to it at different points so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords by very heedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale was transferred to her side and was strongly secured there by the stiffest flukechains for it was plain that unless artificially upheld the body would at once sink to the bottom it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh on the lower part of the bunch before described but as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to but still more curious was the fact of a lancehead of stone being found in him not far from the buried iron the flesh perfectly firm about it who had darted that stone lance and when it might have been darted by some nor west indian long before america was discovered what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling but a sudden stop was put to further discoveries by the ships being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea owing to the bodys immensely increasing tendency to sink however starbuck who had the ordering of affairs hung on to it to the last hung on to it so resolutely indeed that when at length the ship would have been capsized if still persisting in locking arms with the body then when the command was given to break clear from it such was the immovable strain upon the timberheads to which the flukechains and cables were fastened that it was impossible to cast them off meantime everything in the pequod was aslant to cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house the ship groaned and gasped many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places by the unnatural dislocation in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable flukechains to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over hold on hold on wont ye cried stubb to the body dont be in such a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder men we must do something or go for it no use prying there avast i say with your handspikes and run one of ye for a prayer book and a penknife and cut the big chains knife aye aye cried queequeg and seizing the carpenters heavy hatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing at the largest flukechains but a few strokes full of sparks were given when the exceeding strain effected the rest with a terrific snap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sank now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm whale is a very curious thing nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it usually the dead sperm whale floats with great buoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface if the only whales that thus sank were old meagre and brokenhearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him but it is not so for young whales in the highest health and swelling with noble aspirations prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of life with all their panting lard about them even these brawny buoyant heroes do sometimes sink be it said however that the sperm whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species where one of that sort go down twenty right whales do this difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free but there are instances where after the lapse of many hours or several days the sunken whale again rises more buoyant than in life but the reason of this is obvious gases are generated in him he swells to a prodigious magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon a lineofbattle ship could hardly keep him under then in the shore whaling on soundings among the bays of new zealand when a right whale gives token of sinking they fasten buoys to him with plenty of rope so that when the body has gone down they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again it was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the pequods mastheads announcing that the jungfrau was again lowering her boats though the only spout in sight was that of a finback belonging to the species of uncapturable whales because of its incredible power of swimming nevertheless the finbacks spout is so similar to the sperm whales that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it and consequently derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute the virgin crowding all sail made after her four young keels and thus they all disappeared far to leeward still in bold hopeful chase oh many are the finbacks and many are the dericks my friend chapter the honor and glory of whaling there are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method the more i dive into this matter of whaling and push my researches up to the very springhead of it so much the more am i impressed with its great honorableness and antiquity and especially when i find so many great demigods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one way or other have shed distinction upon it i am transported with the reflection that i myself belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a fraternity the gallant perseus a son of jupiter was the first whaleman and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent those were the knightly days of our profession when we only bore arms to succor the distressed and not to fill mens lampfeeders every one knows the fine story of perseus and andromeda how the lovely andromeda the daughter of a king was tied to a rock on the seacoast and as leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off perseus the prince of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster and delivered and married the maid it was an admirable artistic exploit rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day inasmuch as this leviathan was slain at the very first dart and let no man doubt this arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syrian coast in one of the pagan temples there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale which the citys legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew when the romans took joppa the same skeleton was carried to italy in triumph what seems most singular and suggestively important in this story is this it was from joppa that jonah set sail akin to the adventure of perseus and andromedaindeed by some supposed to be indirectly derived from itis that famous story of st george and the dragon which dragon i maintain to have been a whale for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together and often stand for each other thou art as a lion of the waters and as a dragon of the sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale in truth some versions of the bible use that word itself besides it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st george but encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep any man may kill a snake but only a perseus a st george a coffin have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffinlike shape and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback yet considering the great ignorance of those times when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists and considering that as in perseus case st georges whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach and considering that the animal ridden by st george might have been only a large seal or seahorse bearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene to hold this socalled dragon no other than the great leviathan himself in fact placed before the strict and piercing truth this whole story will fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the philistines dagon by name who being planted before the ark of israel his horses head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him and only the stump or fishy part of him remained thus then one of our own noble stamp even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of england and by good rights we harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of st george and therefore let not the knights of that honorable company none of whom i venture to say have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron let them never eye a nantucketer with disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to st georges decoration than they whether to admit hercules among us or not concerning this i long remained dubious for though according to the greek mythologies that antique crockett and kit carsonthat brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him that might be mooted it nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish unless indeed from the inside nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale i claim him for one of our clan but by the best contradictory authorities this grecian story of hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice versâ certainly they are very similar if i claim the demigod then why not the prophet nor do heroes saints demigods and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order our grand master is still to be named for like royal kings of old times we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves that wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the shaster which gives us the dread vishnoo one of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos gives us this divine vishnoo himself for our lordvishnoo who by the first of his ten earthly incarnations has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale when brahma or the god of gods saith the shaster resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions he gave birth to vishnoo to preside over the work but the vedas or mystical books whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before beginning the creation and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects these vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths rescued the sacred volumes was not this vishnoo a whaleman then even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman perseus st george hercules jonah and vishnoo theres a memberroll for you what club but the whalemans can head off like that chapter jonah historically regarded reference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter now some nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of jonah and the whale but then there were some sceptical greeks and romans who standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts for all that one old sagharbor whalemans chief reason for questioning the hebrew story was thishe had one of those quaint oldfashioned bibles embellished with curious unscientific plates one of which represented jonahs whale with two spouts in his heada peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the leviathan the right whale and the varieties of that order concerning which the fishermen have this saying a penny roll would choke him his swallow is so very small but to this bishop jebbs anticipative answer is ready it is not necessary hints the bishop that we consider jonah as tombed in the whales belly but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth and this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop for truly the right whales mouth would accommodate a couple of whisttables and comfortably seat all the players possibly too jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thoughts the right whale is toothless another reason which sagharbor he went by that name urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whales gastric juices but this objection likewise falls to the ground because a german exegetist supposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a _dead_ whaleeven as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents and crawled into them besides it has been divined by other continental commentators that when jonah was thrown overboard from the joppa ship he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a figurehead and i would add possibly called the whale as some craft are nowadays christened the shark the gull the eagle nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a lifepreserveran inflated bag of windwhich the endangered prophet swam to and so was saved from a watery doom poor sagharbor therefore seems worsted all round but he had still another reason for his want of faith it was this if i remember right jonah was swallowed by the whale in the mediterranean sea and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very much more than three days journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast how is that but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of nineveh yes he might have carried him round by the way of the cape of good hope but not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the mediterranean and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all africa in three days not to speak of the tigris waters near the site of nineveh being too shallow for any whale to swim in besides this idea of jonahs weathering the cape of good hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland from bartholomew diaz its reputed discoverer and so make modern history a liar but all these foolish arguments of old sagharbor only evinced his foolish pride of reasona thing still more reprehensible in him seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea i say it only shows his foolish impious pride and abominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy for by a portuguese catholic priest this very idea of jonahs going to nineveh via the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle and so it was besides to this day the highly enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah and some three centuries ago an english traveller in old harriss voyages speaks of a turkish mosque built in honor of jonah in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil chapter pitchpoling to make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriages are anointed and for much the same purpose some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage considering that oil and water are hostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau disappeared took more than customary pains in that occupation crawling under its bottom where it hung over the side and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the crafts bald keel he seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment nor did it remain unwarranted by the event towards noon whales were raised but so soon as the ship sailed down to them they turned and fled with swift precipitancy a disordered flight as of cleopatras barges from actium nevertheless the boats pursued and stubbs was foremost by great exertion tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but the stricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontal flight with added fleetness such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it it became imperative to lance the flying whale or be content to lose him but to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible he swam so fast and furious what then remained of all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand and countless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced none exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling small sword or broad sword in all its exercises boasts nothing like it it is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extreme headway steel and wood included the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon and also of a lighter materialpine it is furnished with a small rope called a warp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting but before going further it is important to mention here that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it is seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks as a general thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before any pitchpoling comes into play look now at stubb a man who from his humorous deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling look at him he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale is forty feet ahead handling the long lance lightly glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand so as to secure its free end in his grasp leaving the rest unobstructed then holding the lance full before his waistbands middle he levels it at the whale when covering him with it he steadily depresses the buttend in his hand thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm fifteen feet in the air he minds you somewhat of a juggler balancing a long staff on his chin next moment with a rapid nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance and quivers in the life spot of the whale instead of sparkling water he now spouts red blood that drove the spigot out of him cried stubb tis julys immortal fourth all fountains must run wine today would now it were old orleans whiskey or old ohio or unspeakable old monongahela then tashtego lad id have ye hold a canakin to the jet and wed drink round it yea verily hearts alive wed brew choice punch in the spread of his spouthole there and from that live punchbowl quaff the living stuff again and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart is repeated the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash the agonized whale goes into his flurry the towline is slackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern folds his hands and mutely watches the monster die chapter the fountain that for six thousand yearsand no one knows how many millions of ages beforethe great whales should have been spouting all over the sea and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots and that for some centuries back thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale watching these sprinklings and spoutingsthat all this should be and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter minutes past one oclock pm of this sixteenth day of december ad it should still remain a problem whether these spoutings are after all really water or nothing but vaporthis is surely a noteworthy thing let us then look at this matter along with some interesting items contingent every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim hence a herring or a cod might live a century and never once raise its head above the surface but owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs like a human beings the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world but he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitude the sperm whales mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface and what is still more his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth no he breathes through his spiracle alone and this is on the top of his head if i say that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle i do not think i shall err though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words assume it and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time that is to say he would then live without breathing anomalous as it may seem this is precisely the case with the whale who systematically lives by intervals his full hour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air for remember he has no gills how is this between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of vermicellilike vessels which vessels when he quits the surface are completely distended with oxygenated blood so that for an hour or more a thousand fathoms in the sea he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true seems the more cogent to me when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_ as the fishermen phrase it this is what i mean if unmolested upon rising to the surface the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings say he stays eleven minutes and jets seventy times that is respires seventy breaths then whenever he rises again he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again to a minute now if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him so that he sounds he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air and not till those seventy breaths are told will he finally go down to stay out his full term below remark however that in different individuals these rates are different but in any one they are alike now why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air ere descending for good how obvious is it too that this necessity for the whales rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight not so much thy skill then o hunter as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee in man breathing is incessantly going onone breath only serving for two or three pulsations so that whatever other business he has to attend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will but the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time it has been said that the whale only breathes through his spouthole if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spouthole and being so clogged with two elements it could not be expected to have the power of smelling but owing to the mystery of the spoutwhether it be water or whether it be vaporno absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head sure it is nevertheless that the sperm whale has no proper olfactories but what does he want of them no roses no violets no colognewater in the sea furthermore as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal and as that long canallike the grand erie canalis furnished with a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale has no voice unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles he talks through his nose but then again what has the whale to say seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to this world unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living oh happy that the world is such an excellent listener now the spouting canal of the sperm whale chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air and for several feet laid along horizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little to one side this curious canal is very much like a gaspipe laid down in a city on one side of a street but the question returns whether this gaspipe is also a waterpipe in other words whether the spout of the sperm whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth and discharged through the spiracle it is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be when in feeding he accidentally takes in water but the sperm whales food is far beneath the surface and there he cannot spout even if he would besides if you regard him very closely and time him with your watch you will find that when unmolested there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject speak out you have seen him spout then declare what the spout is can you not tell water from air my dear sir in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things i have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all and as for this whale spout you might almost stand in it and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely the central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it when always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading all around him and if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spouthole fissure which is countersunk into the summit of the whales head for even when tranquilly swimming through the midday sea in a calm with his elevated hump sundried as a dromedarys in the desert even then the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout it will not do for him to be peering into it and putting his face in it you cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it and bring it away for even when coming into slight contact with the outer vapory shreds of the jet which will often happen your skin will feverishly smart from the acridness of the thing so touching it and i know one who coming into still closer contact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view or otherwise i cannot say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm wherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try to evade it another thing i have heard it said and i do not much doubt it that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes it will blind you the wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me is to let this deadly spout alone still we can hypothesize even if we cannot prove and establish my hypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist and besides other reasons to this conclusion i am impelled by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale i account him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings or near shores all other whales sometimes are he is both ponderous and profound and i am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings such as plato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante and so on there always goes up a certain semivisible steam while in the act of thinking deep thoughts while composing a little treatise on eternity i had the curiosity to place a mirror before me and ere long saw reflected there a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head the invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deep thought after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of an august noon this seems an additional argument for the above supposition and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty misty monster to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor engendered by his incommunicable contemplations and that vaporas you will sometimes see itglorified by a rainbow as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts for dye see rainbows do not visit the clear air they only irradiate vapor and so through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind divine intuitions now and then shoot enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray and for this i thank god for all have doubts many deny but doubts or denials few along with them have intuitions doubts of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly this combination makes neither believer nor infidel but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye chapter the tail other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights less celestial i celebrate a tail reckoning the largest sized sperm whales tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man it comprises upon its upper surface alone an area of at least fifty square feet the compact round body of its root expands into two broad firm flat palms or flukes gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness at the crotch or junction these flukes slightly overlap then sideways recede from each other like wings leaving a wide vacancy between in no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes at its utmost expansion in the full grown whale the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews but cut into it and you find that three distinct strata compose itupper middle and lower the fibres in the upper and lower layers are long and horizontal those of the middle one very short and running crosswise between the outside layers this triune structure as much as anything else imparts power to the tail to the student of old roman walls the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes insensibly blend with them and largely contribute to their might so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point could annihilation occur to matter this were the thing to do it nor does thisits amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions where infantileness of ease undulates through a titanism of power on the contrary those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it real strength never impairs beauty or harmony but it often bestows it and in everything imposingly beautiful strength has much to do with the magic take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved hercules and its charm would be gone as devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man that seemed as a roman triumphal arch when angelo paints even god the father in human form mark what robustness is there and whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the son the soft curled hermaphroditical italian pictures in which his idea has been most successfully embodied these pictures so destitute as they are of all brawniness hint nothing of any power but the mere negative feminine one of submission and endurance which on all hands it is conceded form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of that whether wielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the mood it be in its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace therein no fairys arm can transcend it five great motions are peculiar to it first when used as a fin for progression second when used as a mace in battle third in sweeping fourth in lobtailing fifth in peaking flukes first being horizontal in its position the leviathans tail acts in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures it never wriggles in man or fish wriggling is a sign of inferiority to the whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion scrollwise coiled forwards beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards it is this which gives that singular darting leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming his sidefins only serve to steer by second it is a little significant that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in his conflicts with man he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail in striking at a boat he swiftly curves away his flukes from it and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil if it be made in the unobstructed air especially if it descend to its mark the stroke is then simply irresistible no ribs of man or boat can withstand it your only salvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sideways through the opposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whaleboat and the elasticity of its materials a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is generally the most serious result these submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery that they are accounted mere childs play some one strips off a frock and the hole is stopped third i cannot demonstrate it but it seems to me that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephants trunk this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea and if he feel but a sailors whisker woe to that sailor whiskers and all what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch had this tail any prehensile power i should straightway bethink me of darmonodes elephant that so frequented the flowermarket and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels and then caressed their zones on more accounts than one a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail for i have heard of yet another elephant that when wounded in the fight curved round his trunk and extracted the dart fourth stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity and kittenlike he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth but still you see his power in his play the broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air then smiting the surface the thunderous concussion resounds for miles you would almost think a great gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity you would think that that was the smoke from the touchhole fifth as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface but when he is about to plunge into the deeps his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air and so remain vibrating a moment till they downwards shoot out of view excepting the sublime _breach_somewhere else to be describedthis peaking of the whales flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven so in dreams have i seen majestic satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell but in gazing at such scenes it is all in all what mood you are in if in the dantean the devils will occur to you if in that of isaiah the archangels standing at the masthead of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea i once saw a large herd of whales in the east all heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes as it seemed to me at the time such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld even in persia the home of the fire worshippers as ptolemy philopater testified of the african elephant i then testified of the whale pronouncing him the most devout of all beings for according to king juba the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence the chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the elephant so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality much less the creatures to which they respectively belong for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to leviathan so compared with leviathans tail his trunk is but the stalk of a lily the most direful blow from the elephants trunk were as the playful tap of a fan compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whales ponderous flukes which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air very much as an indian juggler tosses his balls though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant nevertheless there are not wanting some points of curious similitude among these is the spout it is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk and then elevating it jet it forth in a stream the more i consider this mighty tail the more do i deplore my inability to express it at times there are gestures in it which though they would well grace the hand of man remain wholly inexplicable in an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally are these mystic gestures that i have heard hunters who have declared them akin to freemason signs and symbols that the whale indeed by these methods intelligently conversed with the world nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body full of strangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant dissect him how i may then i but go skin deep i know him not and never will but if i know not even the tail of this whale how understand his head much more how comprehend his face when face he has none thou shalt see my back parts my tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen but i cannot completely make out his back parts and hint what he will about his face i say again he has no face chapter the grand armada the long and narrow peninsula of malacca extending southeastward from the territories of birmah forms the most southerly point of all asia in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of sumatra java bally and timor which with many others form a vast mole or rampart lengthwise connecting asia with australia and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes this rampart is pierced by several sallyports for the convenience of ships and whales conspicuous among which are the straits of sunda and malacca by the straits of sunda chiefly vessels bound to china from the west emerge into the china seas those narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands buttressed by that bold green promontory known to seamen as java head they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices and silks and jewels and gold and ivory with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched it seems a significant provision of nature that such treasures by the very formation of the land should at least bear the appearance however ineffectual of being guarded from the allgrasping western world the shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the mediterranean the baltic and the propontis unlike the danes these orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered topsails from the endless procession of ships before the wind which for centuries past by night and by day have passed between the islands of sumatra and java freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east but while they freely waive a ceremonial like this they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of sumatra have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of european cruisers the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed yet even at the present day we occasionally hear of english and american vessels which in those waters have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged with a fair fresh wind the pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan sea and thence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented here and there by the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine islands and gain the far coast of japan in time for the great whaling season there by these means the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all the known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world previous to descending upon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit firmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick in the sea he was most known to frequent and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it but how now in this zoned quest does ahab touch no land does his crew drink air surely he will stop for water nay for a long time now the circusrunning sun has raced within his fiery ring and needs no sustenance but whats in himself so ahab mark this too in the whaler while other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff to be transferred to foreign wharves the worldwandering whaleship carries no cargo but herself and crew their weapons and their wants she has a whole lakes contents bottled in her ample hold she is ballasted with utilities not altogether with unusable piglead and kentledge she carries years water in her clear old prime nantucket water which when three years afloat the nantucketer in the pacific prefers to drink before the brackish fluid but yesterday rafted off in casks from the peruvian or indian streams hence it is that while other ships may have gone to china from new york and back again touching at a score of ports the whaleship in all that interval may not have sighted one grain of soil her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves so that did you carry them the news that another flood had come they would only answerwell boys heres the ark now as many sperm whales had been captured off the western coast of java in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda indeed as most of the ground roundabout was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising therefore as the pequod gained more and more upon java head the lookouts were repeatedly hailed and admonished to keep wide awake but though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air yet not a single jet was descried almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the straits when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us but here be it premised that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans the sperm whales instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies as in former times are now frequently met with in extensive herds sometimes embracing so great a multitude that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection to this aggregation of the sperm whale into such immense caravans may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands broad on both bows at the distance of some two or three miles and forming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon a continuous chain of whalejets were upplaying and sparkling in the noonday air unlike the straight perpendicular twinjets of the right whale which dividing at top fall over in two branches like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow the single forwardslanting spout of the sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continually rising and falling away to leeward seen from the pequods deck then as she would rise on a high hill of the sea this host of vapory spouts individually curling up into the air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis descried of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height as marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains accelerate their march all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle and swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centre crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them the harpooneers handling their weapons and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats if the wind only held little doubt had they that chased through these straits of sunda the vast host would only deploy into the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number and who could tell whether in that congregated caravan moby dick himself might not temporarily be swimming like the worshipped whiteelephant in the coronation procession of the siamese so with stunsail piled on stunsail we sailed along driving these leviathans before us when of a sudden the voice of tashtego was heard loudly directing attention to something in our wake corresponding to the crescent in our van we beheld another in our rear it seemed formed of detached white vapors rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales only they did not so completely come and go for they constantly hovered without finally disappearing levelling his glass at this sight ahab quickly revolved in his pivothole crying aloft there and rig whips and buckets to wet the sailsmalays sir and after us as if too long lurking behind the headlands till the pequod should fairly have entered the straits these rascally asiatics were now in hot pursuit to make up for their overcautious delay but when the swift pequod with a fresh leading wind was herself in hot chase how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuitmere ridingwhips and rowels to her that they were as with glass under arm ahab toandfro paced the deck in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing _him_ some such fancy as the above seemed his and when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance and beheld how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curseswhen all these conceits had passed through his brain ahabs brow was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it without being able to drag the firm thing from its place but thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew and when after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern the pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra side emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond then the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the malays but still driving on in the wake of the whales at length they seemed abating their speed gradually the ship neared them and the wind now dying away word was passed to spring to the boats but no sooner did the herd by some presumed wonderful instinct of the sperm whale become notified of the three keels that were after themthough as yet a mile in their rearthan they rallied again and forming in close ranks and battalions so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets moved on with redoubled velocity stripped to our shirts and drawers we sprang to the whiteash and after several hours pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution which when the fishermen perceive it in the whale they say he is gallied the compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were now broken up in one measureless rout and like king porus elephants in the indian battle with alexander they seemed going mad with consternation in all directions expanding in vast irregular circles and aimlessly swimming hither and thither by their short thick spoutings they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic this was still more strangely evinced by those of their number who completely paralysed as it were helplessly floated like waterlogged dismantled ships on the sea had these leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay but this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures though banding together in tens of thousands the lionmaned buffaloes of the west have fled before a solitary horseman witness too all human beings how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatres pit they will at the slightest alarm of fire rush helterskelter for the outlets crowding trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each other to death best therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men though many of the whales as has been said were in violent motion yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated but collectively remained in one place as is customary in those cases the boats at once separated each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal in about three minutes time queequegs harpoon was flung the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces and then running away with us like light steered straight for the heart of the herd though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances is in no wise unprecedented and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery for as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb as blind and deaf the whale plunged forward as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him as we thus tore a white gash in the sea on all sides menaced as we flew by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by iceisles in a tempest and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed but not a bit daunted queequeg steered us manfully now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance now edging away from that whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead while all the time starbuck stood up in the bows lance in hand pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts for there was no time to make long ones nor were the oarsmen quite idle though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with they chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business out of the way commodore cried one to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface and for an instant threatened to swamp us hard down with your tail there cried a second to another which close to our gunwale seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fanlike extremity all whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances originally invented by the nantucket indians called druggs two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together so that they cross each others grain at right angles a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block and the other end of the line being looped it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon it is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used for then more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time but sperm whales are not every day encountered while you may then you must kill all you can and if you cannot kill them all at once you must wing them so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure hence it is that at times like these the drugg comes into requisition our boat was furnished with three of them the first and second were successfully darted and we saw the whales staggeringly running off fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg they were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball but upon flinging the third in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block it caught under one of the seats of the boat and in an instant tore it out and carried it away dropping the oarsman in the boats bottom as the seat slid from under him on both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in and so stopped the leaks for the time it had been next to impossible to dart these druggedharpoons were it not that as we advanced into the herd our whales way greatly diminished moreover that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion the direful disorders seemed waning so that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out and the towing whale sideways vanished then with the tapering force of his parting momentum we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales were heard but not felt in this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satinlike surface called a sleek produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods yes we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion and still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles and saw successive pods of whales eight or ten in each swiftly going round and round like multiplied spans of horses in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a titanic circusrider might easily have overarched the middle ones and so have gone round on their backs owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us we must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up keeping at the centre of the lake we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves the women and children of this routed host now inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles the entire area at this juncture embraced by the whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square miles at any ratethough indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptivespoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon i mention this circumstance because as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping or possibly being so young unsophisticated and every way innocent and inexperienced however it may have been these smaller whalesnow and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lakeevinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at like household dogs they came snuffling round us right up to our gunwales and touching them till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them queequeg patted their foreheads starbuck scratched their backs with his lance but fearful of the consequences for the time refrained from darting it but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side for suspended in those watery vaults floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers the lake as i have hinted was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast as if leading two different lives at the time and while yet drawing mortal nourishment be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscenceeven so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us but not at us as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their newborn sight floating on their sides the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us one of these little infants that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old might have measured some fourteen feet in length and some six feet in girth he was a little frisky though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the final spring the unborn whale lies bent like a tartars bow the delicate sidefins and the palms of his flukes still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a babys ears newly arrived from foreign parts line line cried queequeg looking over the gunwale him fast him fastwho line him who strucktwo whale one big one little what ails ye man cried starbuck looke here said queequeg pointing down as when the stricken whale that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope as after deep sounding he floats up again and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air so now starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of madame leviathan by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase this natural line with the maternal end loose becomes entangled with the hempen one so that the cub is thereby trapped some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond we saw young leviathan amours in the deep the sperm whale as with all other species of the leviathan but unlike most other fish breeds indifferently at all seasons after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months producing but one at a time though in some few known instances giving birth to an esau and jacoba contingency provided for in suckling by two teats curiously situated one on each side of the anus but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that when by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunters lance the mothers pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods the milk is very sweet and rich it has been tasted by man it might do well with strawberries when overflowing with mutual esteem the whales salute _more hominum_ and thus though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments yea serenely revelled in dalliance and delight but even so amid the tornadoed atlantic of my being do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me deep down and deep inland there i still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy meanwhile as we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them but the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles was nothing to what at last met our eyes it is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert to seek to hamstring him as it were by sundering or maiming his gigantic tailtendon it is done by darting a shorthandled cuttingspade to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again a whale wounded as we afterwards learned in this part but not effectually as it seemed had broken away from the boat carrying along with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of the wound he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado arnold at the battle of saratoga carrying dismay wherever he went but agonizing as was the wound of this whale and an appalling spectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us but at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery this whale had become entangled in the harpoonline that he towed he had also run away with the cuttingspade in him and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoonline round his tail the cuttingspade itself had worked loose from his flesh so that tormented to madness he was now churning through the water violently flailing with his flexible tail and tossing the keen spade about him wounding and murdering his own comrades this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright first the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if lifted by half spent billows from afar then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell the submarine bridalchambers and nurseries vanished in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters yes the long calm was departing a low advancing hum was soon heard and then like to the tumultuous masses of blockice when the great river hudson breaks up in spring the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain instantly starbuck and queequeg changed places starbuck taking the stern oars oars he intensely whispered seizing the helmgripe your oars and clutch your souls now my god men stand by shove him off you queequegthe whale thereprick himhit him stand upstand up and stay so spring menpull men never mind their backsscrape themscrape away the boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks leaving a narrow dardanelles between their long lengths but by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving way rapidly and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet after many similar hairbreadth escapes we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles but now crossed by random whales all violently making for one centre this lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of queequegs hat who while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales had his hat taken clean from his head by the aireddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement for having clumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness further pursuit was useless but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one which flask had killed and waifed the waif is a pennoned pole two or three of which are carried by every boat and which when additional game is at hand are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale both to mark its place on the sea and also as token of prior possession should the boats of any other ship draw near the result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the fisherythe more whales the less fish of all the drugged whales only one was captured the rest contrived to escape for the time but only to be taken as will hereafter be seen by some other craft than the pequod chapter schools and schoolmasters the previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of sperm whales and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations now though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as must have been seen even at the present day small detached bands are occasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each such bands are known as schools they generally are of two sorts those composed almost entirely of females and those mustering none but young vigorous males or bulls as they are familiarly designated in cavalier attendance upon the school of females you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies in truth this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming about over the watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem the contrast between this ottoman and his concubines is striking because while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions the ladies even at full growth are not more than onethird of the bulk of an averagesized male they are comparatively delicate indeed i dare say not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist nevertheless it cannot be denied that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_ it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings like fashionables they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety you meet them on the line in time for the full flower of the equatorial feeding season having just returned perhaps from spending the summer in the northern seas and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth by the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile they start for the oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year when serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strange suspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan coming that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him and chases him away high times indeed if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do what the bashaw will he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out of his bed for alas all fish bed in common as ashore the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers just so with the whales who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love they fence with their long lower jaws sometimes locking them together and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encountersfurrowed heads broken teeth scolloped fins and in some instances wrenched and dislocated mouths but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harems lord then is it very diverting to watch that lord gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines granting other whales to be in sight the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these grand turks for these grand turks are too lavish of their strength and hence their unctuousness is small as for the sons and the daughters they beget why those sons and daughters must take care of themselves at least with only the maternal help for like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named my lord whale has no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so being a great traveller he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world every baby an exotic in good time nevertheless as the ardour of youth declines as years and dumps increase as reflection lends her solemn pauses in short as a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens our ottoman enters upon the impotent repentant admonitory stage of life forswears disbands the harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old soul goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers and warning each young leviathan from his amorous errors now as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster it is therefore not in strict character however admirably satirical that after going to school himself he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there but the folly of it his title schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale must have read the memoirs of vidocq and informed himself what sort of a countryschoolmaster that famous frenchman was in his younger days and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years is true of all aged sperm whales almost universally a lone whaleas a solitary leviathan is calledproves an ancient one like venerable mossbearded daniel boone he will have no one near him but nature herself and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters and the best of wives she is though she keeps so many moody secrets the schools composing none but young and vigorous males previously mentioned offer a strong contrast to the harem schools for while those female whales are characteristically timid the young males or fortybarrelbulls as they call them are by far the most pugnacious of all leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter excepting those wondrous greyheaded grizzled whales sometimes met and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout the fortybarrelbull schools are larger than the harem schools like a mob of young collegians they are full of fight fun and wickedness tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at yale or harvard they soon relinquish this turbulence though and when about threefourths grown break up and separately go about in quest of settlements that is harems another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes say you strike a fortybarrelbullpoor devil all his comrades quit him but strike a member of the harem school and her companions swim around her with every token of concern sometimes lingering so near her and so long as themselves to fall a prey chapter fastfish and loosefish the allusion to the waif and waifpoles in the last chapter but one necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge it frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company a whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and be finally killed and captured by another vessel and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies all partaking of this one grand feature for exampleafter a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a calm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or line thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen were there not some written or unwritten universal undisputed law applicable to all cases perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment was that of holland it was decreed by the statesgeneral in ad but though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law yet the american fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter they have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses justinians pandects and the bylaws of the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other peoples business yes these laws might be engraven on a queen annes farthing or the barb of a harpoon and worn round the neck so small are they i a fastfish belongs to the party fast to it ii a loosefish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it but what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it first what is a fastfish alive or dead a fish is technically fast when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupantsa mast an oar a nineinch cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb it is all the same likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif or any other recognised symbol of possession so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside as well as their intention so to do these are scientific commentaries but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocksthe cokeuponlittleton of the fist true among the more upright and honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party but others are by no means so scrupulous some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whaletrover litigated in england wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the northern seas and when indeed they the plaintiffs had succeeded in harpooning the fish they were at last through peril of their lives obliged to forsake not only their lines but their boat itself ultimately the defendants the crew of another ship came up with the whale struck killed seized and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs and when those defendants were remonstrated with their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs teeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done he would now retain their line harpoons and boat which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale line harpoons and boat mr erskine was counsel for the defendants lord ellenborough was the judge in the course of the defence the witty erskine went on to illustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim con case wherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wifes viciousness had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life but in the course of years repenting of that step he instituted an action to recover possession of her erskine was on the other side and he then supported it by saying that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady and had once had her fast and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness had at last abandoned her yet abandon her he did so that she became a loosefish and therefore when a subsequent gentleman reharpooned her the lady then became that subsequent gentlemans property along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her now in the present case erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other these pleadings and the counter pleadings being duly heard the very learned judge in set terms decided to witthat as for the boat he awarded it to the plaintiffs because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives but that with regard to the controverted whale harpoons and line they belonged to the defendants the whale because it was a loosefish at the time of the final capture and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them it the fish acquired a property in those articles and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them now the defendants afterwards took the fish ergo the aforesaid articles were theirs a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might possibly object to it but ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in the above cited case these two laws touching fastfish and loosefish i say will on reflection be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture the temple of the law like the temple of the philistines has but two props to stand on is it not a saying in every ones mouth possession is half of the law that is regardless of how the thing came into possession but often possession is the whole of the law what are the sinews and souls of russian serfs and republican slaves but fastfish whereof possession is the whole of the law what to the rapacious landlord is the widows last mite but a fastfish what is yonder undetected villains marble mansion with a doorplate for a waif what is that but a fastfish what is the ruinous discount which mordecai the broker gets from poor woebegone the bankrupt on a loan to keep woebegones family from starvation what is that ruinous discount but a fastfish what is the archbishop of savesouls income of seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of brokenbacked laborers all sure of heaven without any of savesouls help what is that globular but a fastfish what are the duke of dunders hereditary towns and hamlets but fastfish what to that redoubted harpooneer john bull is poor ireland but a fastfish what to that apostolic lancer brother jonathan is texas but a fastfish and concerning all these is not possession the whole of the law but if the doctrine of fastfish be pretty generally applicable the kindred doctrine of loosefish is still more widely so that is internationally and universally applicable what was america in but a loosefish in which columbus struck the spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress what was poland to the czar what greece to the turk what india to england what at last will mexico be to the united states all loosefish what are the rights of man and the liberties of the world but loosefish what all mens minds and opinions but loosefish what is the principle of religious belief in them but a loosefish what to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but loosefish what is the great globe itself but a loosefish and what are you reader but a loosefish and a fastfish too chapter heads or tails de balena vero sufficit si rex habeat caput et regina caudam _bracton l c _ latin from the books of the laws of england which taken along with the context means that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land the king as honorary grand harpooneer must have the head and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail a division which in the whale is much like halving an apple there is no intermediate remainder now as this law under a modified form is to this day in force in england and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loosefish it is here treated of in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle that prompts the english railways to be at the expense of a separate car specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty in the first place in curious proof of the fact that the abovementioned law is still in force i proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years it seems that some honest mariners of dover or sandwich or some one of the cinque ports had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore now the cinque ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle called a lord warden holding the office directly from the crown i believe all the royal emoluments incident to the cinque port territories become by assignment his by some writers this office is called a sinecure but not so because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them now when these poor sunburnt mariners barefooted and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry promising themselves a good from the precious oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives and good ale with their cronies upon the strength of their respective shares up steps a very learned and most christian and charitable gentleman with a copy of blackstone under his arm and laying it upon the whales head he sayshands off this fish my masters is a fastfish i seize it as the lord wardens upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternationso truly englishknowing not what to say fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger but that did in nowise mend the matter or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone at length one of them after long scratching about for his ideas made bold to speak please sir who is the lord warden the duke but the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish it is his we have been at great trouble and peril and some expense and is all that to go to the dukes benefit we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters it is his is the duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood it is his i thought to relieve my old bedridden mother by part of my share of this whale it is his wont the duke be content with a quarter or a half it is his in a word the whale was seized and sold and his grace the duke of wellington received the money thinking that viewed in some particular lights the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed under the circumstances a rather hard one an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration to which my lord duke in substance replied both letters were published that he had already done so and received the money and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he the reverend gentleman would decline meddling with other peoples business is this the still militant old man standing at the corners of the three kingdoms on all hands coercing alms of beggars it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duke to the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign we must needs inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested with that right the law itself has already been set forth but plowdon gives us the reason for it says plowdon the whale so caught belongs to the king and queen because of its superior excellence and by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters but why should the king have the head and the queen the tail a reason for that ye lawyers in his treatise on queengold or queenpinmoney an old kings bench author one william prynne thus discourseth ye tail is ye queens that ye queens wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or right whale was largely used in ladies bodices but this same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like prynne but is the queen a mermaid to be presented with a tail an allegorical meaning may lurk here there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writersthe whale and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitations and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crowns ordinary revenue i know not that any other author has hinted of the matter but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality and thus there seems a reason in all things even in law chapter the pequod meets the rosebud in vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this leviathan insufferable fetor denying not inquiry _sir t browne ve_ it was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapory midday sea that the many noses on the pequods deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea i will bet something now said stubb that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day i thought they would keel up before long presently the vapors in advance slid aside and there in the distance lay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside as we glided nearer the stranger showed french colours from his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture seafowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale that is a whale that has died unmolested on the sea and so floated an unappropriated corpse it may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale worse than an assyrian city in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury the departed so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality and by no means of the nature of attarofrose coming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the frenchman had a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first in truth it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this however much he may shun blasted whales in general the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spadepole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales theres a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in the ships bows theres a jackal for ye i well know that these crappoes of frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery sometimes lowering their boats for breakers mistaking them for sperm whale spouts yes and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles and cases of snuffers foreseeing that all the oil they will get wont be enough to dip the captains wick into aye we all know these things but look ye heres a crappo that is content with our leavings the drugged whale there i mean aye and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there poor devil i say pass round a hat some one and lets make him a present of a little oil for dear charitys sake for what oil hell get from that drugged whale there wouldnt be fit to burn in a jail no not in a condemned cell and as for the other whale why ill agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than hell get from that bundle of bones though now that i think of it it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris i wonder now if our old man has thought of that its worth trying yes im for it and so saying he started for the quarterdeck by this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whether or no the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again issuing from the cabin stubb now called his boats crew and pulled off for the stranger drawing across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french taste the upper part of her stempiece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk was painted green and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour upon her head boards in large gilt letters he read bouton de roserosebutton or rosebud and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship though stubb did not understand the _bouton_ part of the inscription yet the word _rose_ and the bulbous figurehead put together sufficiently explained the whole to him a wooden rosebud eh he cried with his hand to his nose that will do very well but how like all creation it smells now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side and thus come close to the blasted whale and so talk over it arrived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose he bawledboutonderose ahoy are there any of you boutonderoses that speak english yes rejoined a guernseyman from the bulwarks who turned out to be the chiefmate well then my boutonderosebud have you seen the white whale _what_ whale the _white_ whalea sperm whalemoby dick have ye seen him never heard of such a whale cachalot blanche white whaleno very good then good bye now and ill call again in a minute then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod and seeing ahab leaning over the quarterdeck rail awaiting his report he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shoutedno sir no upon which ahab retired and stubb returned to the frenchman he now perceived that the guernseyman who had just got into the chains and was using a cuttingspade had slung his nose in a sort of bag whats the matter with your nose there said stubb broke it i wish it was broken or that i didnt have any nose at all answered the guernseyman who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much but what are you holding _yours_ for oh nothing its a wax nose i have to hold it on fine day aint it air rather gardenny i should say throw us a bunch of posies will ye boutonderose what in the devils name do you want here roared the guernseyman flying into a sudden passion oh keep coolcool yes thats the word why dont you pack those whales in ice while youre working at em but joking aside though do you know rosebud that its all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales as for that dried up one there he hasnt a gill in his whole carcase i know that well enough but dye see the captain here wont believe it this is his first voyage he was a cologne manufacturer before but come aboard and mayhap hell believe you if he wont me and so ill get out of this dirty scrape anything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined stubb and with that he soon mounted to the deck there a queer scene presented itself the sailors in tasselled caps of red worsted were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales but they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor all their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jibbooms now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up to the masthead to get some fresh air some thinking they would catch the plague dipped oakum in coaltar and at intervals held it to their nostrils others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl were vigorously puffing tobaccosmoke so that it constantly filled their olfactories stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the captains roundhouse abaft and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajar from within this was the tormented surgeon who after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day had betaken himself to the captains roundhouse _cabinet_ he called it to avoid the pest but still could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times marking all this stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to the guernseyman had a little chat with him during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle sounding him carefully stubb further perceived that the guernseyman had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris he therefore held his peace on that head but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity according to this little plan of theirs the guernseyman under cover of an interpreters office was to tell the captain what he pleased but as coming from stubb and as for stubb he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin he was a small and dark but rather delicate looking man for a seacaptain with large whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watchseals at his side to this gentleman stubb was now politely introduced by the guernseyman who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them what shall i say to him first said he why said stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me though i dont pretend to be a judge he says monsieur said the guernseyman in french turning to his captain that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captain and chiefmate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside upon this the captain started and eagerly desired to know more what now said the guernseyman to stubb why since he takes it so easy tell him that now i have eyed him carefully im quite certain that hes no more fit to command a whaleship than a st jago monkey in fact tell him from me hes a baboon he vows and declares monsieur that the other whale the dried one is far more deadly than the blasted one in fine monsieur he conjures us as we value our lives to cut loose from these fish instantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cuttingtackles and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship what now said the guernseyman when the captain had returned to them why let me see yes you may as well tell him now thatthatin fact tell him ive diddled him and aside to himself perhaps somebody else he says monsieur that hes very happy to have been of any service to us hearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties meaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux he wants you to take a glass of wine with him said the interpreter thank him heartily but tell him its against my principles to drink with the man ive diddled in fact tell him i must go he says monsieur that his principles wont admit of his drinking but that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink then monsieur had best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whales for its so calm they wont drift by this time stubb was over the side and getting into his boat hailed the guernseyman to this effectthat having a long towline in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ships side while the frenchmans boats then were engaged in towing the ship one way stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long towline presently a breeze sprang up stubb feigned to cast off from the whale hoisting his boats the frenchman soon increased his distance while the pequod slid in between him and stubbs whale whereupon stubb quickly pulled to the floating body and hailing the pequod to give notice of his intentions at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning seizing his sharp boatspade he commenced an excavation in the body a little behind the side fin you would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs it was like turning up old roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam his boats crew were all in high excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking as anxious as goldhunters and all the time numberless fowls were diving and ducking and screaming and yelling and fighting around them stubb was beginning to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increased when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it as one river will flow into and then along with another without at all blending with it for a time i have it i have it cried stubb with delight striking something in the subterranean regions a purse a purse dropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old cheese very unctuous and savory withal you might easily dent it with your thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour and this good friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidably lost in the sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were it not for impatient ahabs loud command to stubb to desist and come on board else the ship would bid them good bye chapter ambergris now this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important as an article of commerce that in a certain nantucketborn captain coffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that subject for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day the precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem to the learned though the word ambergris is but the french compound for grey amber yet the two substances are quite distinct for amber though at times found on the seacoast is also dug up in some far inland soils whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea besides amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance used for mouthpieces to pipes for beads and ornaments but ambergris is soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largely used in perfumery in pastiles precious candles hairpowders and pomatum the turks use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to st peters in rome some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret to flavor it who would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale yet so it is by some ambergris is supposed to be the cause and by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administering three or four boat loads of brandreths pills and then running out of harms way as laborers do in blasting rocks i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris certain hard round bony plates which at first stubb thought might be sailors trowsers buttons but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay is this nothing bethink thee of that saying of st paul in corinthians about corruption and incorruption how that we are sown in dishonor but raised in glory and likewise call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk also forget not the strange fact that of all things of illsavor colognewater in its rudimental manufacturing stages is the worst i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but cannot owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen and which in the estimation of some already biased minds might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the frenchmans two whales elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly untidy business but there is another thing to rebut they hint that all whales always smell bad now how did this odious stigma originate i opine that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the greenland whaling ships in london more than two centuries ago because those whalemen did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea as the southern ships have always done but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits thrust it through the bung holes of large casks and carry it home in that manner the shortness of the season in those icy seas and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed forbidding any other course the consequence is that upon breaking into the hold and unloading one of these whale cemeteries in the greenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city graveyard for the foundations of a lyingin hospital i partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in former times of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack in his great work on smells a textbook on that subject as its name imports smeer fat berg to put up this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out without being taken home to holland for that purpose it was a collection of furnaces fatkettles and oil sheds and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor but all this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler which in a voyage of four years perhaps after completely filling her hold with oil does not perhaps consume fifty days in the business of boiling out and in the state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless the truth is that living or dead if but decently treated whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognised as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a jew in the company by the nose nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant when as a general thing he enjoys such high health taking abundance of exercise always out of doors though it is true seldom in the open air i say that the motion of a sperm whales flukes above water dispenses a perfume as when a muskscented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance considering his magnitude must it not be to that famous elephant with jewelled tusks and redolent with myrrh which was led out of an indian town to do honor to alexander the great chapter the castaway it was but some few days after encountering the frenchman that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the pequods crew an event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own now in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats some few hands are reserved called shipkeepers whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale as a general thing these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats crews but if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a shipkeeper it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nickname pip by abbreviation poor pip ye have heard of him before ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight so gloomyjolly in outer aspect pip and doughboy made a match like a black pony and a white one of equal developments though of dissimilar colour driven in one eccentric span but while hapless doughboy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects pip though over tenderhearted was at bottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer freer relish than any other race for blacks the years calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixtyfive fourth of julys and new years days nor smile so while i write that this little black was brilliant for even blackness has its brilliancy behold yon lustrous ebony panelled in kings cabinets but pip loved life and all lifes peaceable securities so that the panicstriking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped had most sadly blurred his brightness though as ere long will be seen what was thus temporarily subdued in him in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tolland county in connecticut he had once enlivened many a fiddlers frolic on the green and at melodious eventide with his gay haha had turned the round horizon into one starbelled tambourine so though in the clear air of day suspended against a blueveined neck the purewatered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre he lays it against a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some unnatural gases then come out those fiery effulgences infernally superb then the evilblazing diamond once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies looks like some crownjewel stolen from the king of hell but let us to the story it came to pass that in the ambergris affair stubbs afteroarsman chanced so to sprain his hand as for a time to become quite maimed and temporarily pip was put into his place the first time stubb lowered with him pip evinced much nervousness but happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale and therefore came off not altogether discreditably though stubb observing him took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost for he might often find it needful now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and as the fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap which happened in this instance to be right under poor pips seat the involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so as to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water that instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the line swiftly straightened and presto poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken several turns around his chest and neck tashtego stood in the bows he was full of the fire of the hunt he hated pip for a poltroon snatching the boatknife from its sheath he suspended its sharp edge over the line and turning towards stubb exclaimed interrogatively cut meantime pips blue choked face plainly looked do for gods sake all passed in a flash in less than half a minute this entire thing happened damn him cut roared stubb and so the whale was lost and pip was saved so soon as he recovered himself the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate stubb then in a plain businesslike but still half humorous manner cursed pip officially and that done unofficially gave him much wholesome advice the substance was never jump from a boat pip exceptbut all the rest was indefinite as the soundest advice ever is now in general _stick to the boat_ is your true motto in whaling but cases will sometimes happen when _leap from the boat_ is still better moreover as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenly dropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command stick to the boat pip or by the lord i wont pick you up if you jump mind that we cant afford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would sell for thirty times what you would pip in alabama bear that in mind and dont jump any more hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted that though man loved his fellow yet man is a moneymaking animal which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence but we are all in the hands of the gods and pip jumped again it was under very similar circumstances to the first performance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale started to run pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried travellers trunk alas stubb was but too true to his word it was a beautiful bounteous blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and flatly stretching away all round to the horizon like goldbeaters skin hammered out to the extremest bobbing up and down in that sea pips ebon head showed like a head of cloves no boatknife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern stubbs inexorable back was turned upon him and the whale was winged in three minutes a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between pip and stubb out from the centre of the sea poor pip turned his crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though the loftiest and the brightest now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a springcarriage ashore but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable the intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity my god who can tell it mark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open seamark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate no he did not mean to at least because there were two boats in his wake and he supposed no doubt that they would of course come up to pip very quickly and pick him up though indeed such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances and such instances not unfrequently occur almost invariably in the fishery a coward so called is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies but it so happened that those boats without seeing pip suddenly spying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and stubbs boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish that pips ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such at least they said he was the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up but drowned the infinite of his soul not drowned entirely though rather carried down alive to wondrous depths where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes and the misermerman wisdom revealed his hoarded heaps and among the joyous heartless everjuvenile eternities pip saw the multitudinous godomnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs he saw gods foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad so mans insanity is heavens sense and wandering from all mortal reason man comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromised indifferent as his god for the rest blame not stubb too hardly the thing is common in that fishery and in the sequel of the narrative it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself chapter a squeeze of the hand that whale of stubbs so dearly purchased was duly brought to the pequods side where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun or case while some were occupied with this latter duty others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs so soon as filled with the sperm and when the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the tryworks of which anon it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when with several others i sat down before a large constantines bath of it i found it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling about in the liquid part it was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid a sweet and unctuous duty no wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic such a clearer such a sweetener such a softener such a delicious molifier after having my hands in it for only a few minutes my fingers felt like eels and began as it were to serpentine and spiralise as i sat there at my ease crosslegged on the deck after the bitter exertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under indolent sail and gliding so serenely along as i bathed my hands among those soft gentle globules of infiltrated tissues woven almost within the hour as they richly broke to my fingers and discharged all their opulence like fully ripe grapes their wine as i snuffed up that uncontaminated aromaliterally and truly like the smell of spring violets i declare to you that for the time i lived as in a musky meadow i forgot all about our horrible oath in that inexpressible sperm i washed my hands and my heart of it i almost began to credit the old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger while bathing in that bath i felt divinely free from all illwill or petulance or malice of any sort whatsoever squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long i squeezed that sperm till i myself almost melted into it i squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me and i found myself unwittingly squeezing my colaborers hands in it mistaking their hands for the gentle globules such an abounding affectionate friendly loving feeling did this avocation beget that at last i was continually squeezing their hands and looking up into their eyes sentimentally as much as to sayoh my dear fellow beings why should we longer cherish any social acerbities or know the slightest illhumor or envy come let us squeeze hands all round nay let us all squeeze ourselves into each other let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever for now since by many prolonged repeated experiences i have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable felicity not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the fireside the country now that i have perceived all this i am ready to squeeze case eternally in thoughts of the visions of the night i saw long rows of angels in paradise each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti now while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things akin to it in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the tryworks first comes whitehorse so called which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish and also from the thicker portions of his flukes it is tough with congealed tendonsa wad of musclebut still contains some oil after being severed from the whale the whitehorse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer they look much like blocks of berkshire marble plumpudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whales flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness it is a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold as its name imports it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple it is plums of rubies in pictures of citron spite of reason it is hard to keep yourself from eating it i confess that once i stole behind the foremast to try it it tasted something as i should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have tasted supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagne there is another substance and a very singular one which turns up in the course of this business but which i feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe it is called slobgollion an appellation original with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substance it is an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently found in the tubs of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting i hold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membranes of the case coalescing gurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen it designates the dark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the greenland or right whale and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan nippers strictly this word is not indigenous to the whales vocabulary but as applied by whalemen it becomes so a whalemans nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of leviathans tail it averages an inch in thickness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewise moved along the oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and by nameless blandishments as of magic allures along with it all impurities but to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is at once to descend into the blubberroom and have a long talk with its inmates this place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanketpieces when stript and hoisted from the whale when the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros especially by night on one side lit by a dull lantern a space has been left clear for the workmen they generally go in pairsa pikeandgaffman and a spademan the whalingpike is similar to a frigates boardingweapon of the same name the gaff is something like a boathook with his gaff the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber and strives to hold it from slipping as the ship pitches and lurches about meanwhile the spademan stands on the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horsepieces this spade is sharp as hone can make it the spademans feet are shoeless the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him like a sledge if he cuts off one of his own toes or one of his assistants would you be very much astonished toes are scarce among veteran blubberroom men chapter the cassock had you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of this postmortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would have seen there lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers not the wondrous cistern in the whales huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so surprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountable conelonger than a kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jetblack as yojo the ebony idol of queequeg and an idol indeed it is or rather in old times its likeness was such an idol as that found in the secret groves of queen maachah in judea and for worshipping which king asa her son did depose her and destroyed the idol and burnt it for an abomination at the brook kedron as darkly set forth in the th chapter of the first book of kings look at the sailor called the mincer who now comes along and assisted by two allies heavily backs the grandissimus as the mariners call it and with bowed shoulders staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field extending it upon the forecastle deck he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt as an african hunter the pelt of a boa this done he turns the pelt inside out like a pantaloon leg gives it a good stretching so as almost to double its diameter and at last hangs it well spread in the rigging to dry ere long it is taken down when removing some three feet of it towards the pointed extremity and then cutting two slits for armholes at the other end he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it the mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling immemorial to all his order this investiture alone will adequately protect him while employed in the peculiar functions of his office that office consists in mincing the horsepieces of blubber for the pots an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse planted endwise against the bulwarks and with a capacious tub beneath it into which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheets from a rapt orators desk arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaves what a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a pope were this mincer bible leaves bible leaves this is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer it enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into as thin slices as possible inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated and its quantity considerably increased besides perhaps improving it in quality chapter the tryworks besides her hoisted boats an american whaler is outwardly distinguished by her tryworks she presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship it is as if from the open field a brickkiln were transported to her planks the tryworks are planted between the foremast and mainmast the most roomy part of the deck the timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar some ten feet by eight square and five in height the foundation does not penetrate the deck but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides and screwing it down to the timbers on the flanks it is cased with wood and at top completely covered by a large sloping battened hatchway removing this hatch we expose the great trypots two in number and each of several barrels capacity when not in use they are kept remarkably clean sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand till they shine within like silver punchbowls during the nightwatches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap while employed in polishing themone man in each pot side by sidemany confidential communications are carried on over the iron lips it is a place also for profound mathematical meditation it was in the left hand trypot of the pequod with the soapstone diligently circling round me that i was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid my soapstone for example will descend from any point in precisely the same time removing the fireboard from the front of the tryworks the bare masonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces directly underneath the pots these mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron the intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works by a tunnel inserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates there are no external chimneys they open direct from the rear wall and here let us go back for a moment it was about nine oclock at night that the pequods tryworks were first started on this present voyage it belonged to stubb to oversee the business all ready there off hatch then and start her you cook fire the works this was an easy thing for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the tryworks has to be fed for a time with wood after that no wood is used except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel in a word after being tried out the crisp shrivelled blubber now called scraps or fritters still contains considerable of its unctuous properties these fritters feed the flames like a plethoric burning martyr or a selfconsuming misanthrope once ignited the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body would that he consumed his own smoke for his smoke is horrible to inhale and inhale it you must and not only that but you must live in it for the time it has an unspeakable wild hindoo odor about it such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres it smells like the left wing of the day of judgment it is an argument for the pit by midnight the works were in full operation we were clear from the carcase sail had been made the wind was freshening the wild ocean darkness was intense but that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed greek fire the burning ship drove on as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed so the pitch and sulphurfreighted brigs of the bold hydriote canaris issuing from their midnight harbors with broad sheets of flame for sails bore down upon the turkish frigates and folded them in conflagrations the hatch removed from the top of the works now afforded a wide hearth in front of them standing on this were the tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers always the whaleships stokers with huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots or stirred up the fires beneath till the snaky flames darted curling out of the doors to catch them by the feet the smoke rolled away in sullen heaps to every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces opposite the mouth of the works on the further side of the wide wooden hearth was the windlass this served for a seasofa here lounged the watch when not otherwise employed looking into the red heat of the fire till their eyes felt scorched in their heads their tawny features now all begrimed with smoke and sweat their matted beards and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works as they narrated to each other their unholy adventures their tales of terror told in words of mirth as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them like the flames from the furnace as to and fro in their front the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth and viciously spat round her on all sides then the rushing pequod freighted with savages and laden with fire and burning a corpse and plunging into that blackness of darkness seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commanders soul so seemed it to me as i stood at her helm and for long hours silently guided the way of this fireship on the sea wrapped for that interval in darkness myself i but the better saw the redness the madness the ghastliness of others the continual sight of the fiend shapes before me capering half in smoke and half in fire these at last begat kindred visions in my soul so soon as i began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm but that night in particular a strange and ever since inexplicable thing occurred to me starting from a brief standing sleep i was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong the jawbone tiller smote my side which leaned against it in my ears was the low hum of sails just beginning to shake in the wind i thought my eyes were open i was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart but spite of all this i could see no compass before me to steer by though it seemed but a minute since i had been watching the card by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness uppermost was the impression that whatever swift rushing thing i stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern a stark bewildered feeling as of death came over me convulsively my hands grasped the tiller but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was somehow in some enchanted way inverted my god what is the matter with me thought i lo in my brief sleep i had turned myself about and was fronting the ships stern with my back to her prow and the compass in an instant i faced back just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind and very probably capsizing her how glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee look not too long in the face of the fire o man never dream with thy hand on the helm turn not thy back to the compass accept the first hint of the hitching tiller believe not the artificial fire when its redness makes all things look ghastly tomorrow in the natural sun the skies will be bright those who glared like devils in the forking flames the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief the glorious golden glad sun the only true lampall others but liars nevertheless the sun hides not virginias dismal swamp nor romes accursed campagna nor wide sahara nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon the sun hides not the ocean which is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds of this earth so therefore that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him that mortal man cannot be truenot true or undeveloped with books the same the truest of all men was the man of sorrows and the truest of all books is solomons and ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe all is vanity all this wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian solomons wisdom yet but he who dodges hospitals and jails and walks fast crossing graveyards and would rather talk of operas than hell calls cowper young pascal rousseau poor devils all of sick men and throughout a carefree lifetime swears by rabelais as passing wise and therefore jollynot that man is fitted to sit down on tombstones and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous solomon but even solomon he says the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain _ie_ even while living in the congregation of the dead give not thyself up then to fire lest it invert thee deaden thee as for the time it did me there is a wisdom that is woe but there is a woe that is madness and there is a catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces and even if he for ever flies within the gorge that gorge is in the mountains so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain even though they soar chapter the lamp had you descended from the pequods tryworks to the pequods forecastle where the off duty watch were sleeping for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors there they lay in their triangular oaken vaults each mariner a chiselled muteness a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes in merchantmen oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens to dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble in darkness to his pallet this is his usual lot but the whaleman as he seeks the food of light so he lives in light he makes his berth an aladdins lamp and lays him down in it so that in the pitchiest night the ships black hull still houses an illumination see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lampsoften but old bottles and vials thoughto the copper cooler at the tryworks and replenishes them there as mugs of ale at a vat he burns too the purest of oil in its unmanufactured and therefore unvitiated state a fluid unknown to solar lunar or astral contrivances ashore it is sweet as early grass butter in april he goes and hunts for his oil so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game chapter stowing down and clearing up already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the masthead how he is chased over the watery moors and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep how he is then towed alongside and beheaded and how on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner how in due time he is condemned to the pots and like shadrach meshach and abednego his spermaceti oil and bone pass unscathed through the firebut now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsingsinging if i maythe romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities sliding along beneath the surface as before but alas never more to rise and blow while still warm the oil like hot punch is received into the sixbarrel casks and while perhaps the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over end for end and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck like so many land slides till at last manhandled and stayed in their course and all round the hoops rap rap go as many hammers as can play upon them for now _ex officio_ every sailor is a cooper at length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then the great hatchways are unsealed the bowels of the ship are thrown open and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea this done the hatches are replaced and hermetically closed like a closet walled up in the sperm fishery this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in all the business of whaling one day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil on the sacred quarterdeck enormous masses of the whales head are profanely piled great rusty casks lie about as in a brewery yard the smoke from the tryworks has besooted all the bulwarks the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness the entire ship seems great leviathan himself while on all hands the din is deafening but a day or two after you look about you and prick your ears in this selfsame ship and were it not for the telltale boats and tryworks you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel with a most scrupulously neat commander the unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue this is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil besides from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale a potent lye is readily made and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side that lye quickly exterminates it hands go diligently along the bulwarks and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness the soot is brushed from the lower rigging all the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away the great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the tryworks completely hiding the pots every cask is out of sight all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ships company the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions shift themselves from top to toe and finally issue to the immaculate deck fresh and all aglow as bridegrooms newleaped from out the daintiest holland now with elated step they pace the planks in twos and threes and humorously discourse of parlors sofas carpets and fine cambrics propose to mat the deck think of having hanging to the top object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle to hint to such musked mariners of oil and bone and blubber were little short of audacity they know not the thing you distantly allude to away and bring us napkins but mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand three men intent on spying out more whales which if caught infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture and drop at least one small greasespot somewhere yes and many is the time when after the severest uninterrupted labors which know no night continuing straight through for ninetysix hours when from the boat where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the linethey only step to the deck to carry vast chains and heave the heavy windlass and cut and slash yea and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial tryworks when on the heel of all this they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship and make a spotless dairy room of it many is the time the poor fellows just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks are startled by the cry of there she blows and away they fly to fight another whale and go through the whole weary thing again oh my friends but this is mankilling yet this is life for hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this worlds vast bulk its small but valuable sperm and then with weary patience cleansed ourselves from its defilements and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul hardly is this done when_there she blows_the ghost is spouted up and away we sail to fight some other world and go through young lifes old routine again oh the metempsychosis oh pythagoras that in bright greece two thousand years ago did die so good so wise so mild i sailed with thee along the peruvian coast last voyageand foolish as i am taught thee a green simple boy how to splice a rope chapter the doubloon ere now it has been related how ahab was wont to pace his quarterdeck taking regular turns at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks when most plunged in his mood he was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him when he halted before the binnacle with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast then as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness only dashed with a certain wild longing if not hopefulness but one morning turning to pass the doubloon he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them and some certain significance lurks in all things else all things are little worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher except to sell by the cartload as they do hills about boston to fill up some morass in the milky way now this doubloon was of purest virgin gold raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills whence east and west over golden sands the headwaters of many a pactolus flows and though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes yet untouchable and immaculate to any foulness it still preserved its quito glow nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last for it was set apart and sanctified to one awestriking end and however wanton in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it as the white whales talisman sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night wondering whose it was to be at last and whether he would ever live to spend it now those noble golden coins of south america are as medals of the sun and tropic tokenpieces here palms alpacas and volcanoes suns disks and stars ecliptics hornsofplenty and rich banners waving are in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by passing through those fancy mints so spanishly poetic it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod was a most wealthy example of these things on its round border it bore the letters republica del ecuador quito so this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world and beneath the great equator and named after it and it had been cast midway up the andes in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three andes summits from one a flame a tower on another on the third a crowing cock while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at libra before this equatorial coin ahab not unobserved by others was now pausing theres something ever egotistical in mountaintops and towers and all other grand and lofty things look herethree peaks as proud as lucifer the firm tower that is ahab the volcano that is ahab the courageous the undaunted and victorious fowl that too is ahab all are ahab and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe which like a magicians glass to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self great pains small gains for those who ask the world to solve them it cannot solve itself methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face but see aye he enters the sign of storms the equinox and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at aries from storm to storm so be it then born in throes tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs so be it then heres stout stuff for woe to work on so be it then no fairy fingers can have pressed the gold but devils claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday murmured starbuck to himself leaning against the bulwarks the old man seems to read belshazzars awful writing i have never marked the coin inspectingly he goes below let me read a dark valley between three mighty heavenabiding peaks that almost seem the trinity in some faint earthly symbol so in this vale of death god girds us round and over all our gloom the sun of righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope if we bend down our eyes the dark vale shows her mouldy soil but if we lift them the bright sun meets our glance half way to cheer yet oh the great sun is no fixture and if at midnight we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him we gaze for him in vain this coin speaks wisely mildly truly but still sadly to me i will quit it lest truth shake me falsely there nows the old mogul soliloquized stubb by the tryworks hes been twigging it and there goes starbuck from the same and both with faces which i should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long and all from looking at a piece of gold which did i have it now on negro hill or in corlaers hook id not look at it very long ere spending it humph in my poor insignificant opinion i regard this as queer i have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings your doubloons of old spain your doubloons of peru your doubloons of chili your doubloons of bolivia your doubloons of popayan with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles and joes and half joes and quarter joes what then should there be in this doubloon of the equator that is so killing wonderful by golconda let me read it once halloa heres signs and wonders truly that now is what old bowditch in his epitome calls the zodiac and what my almanac below calls ditto ill get the almanac and as i have heard devils can be raised with dabolls arithmetic ill try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the massachusetts calendar heres the book lets see now signs and wonders and the sun hes always among em hem hem hem here they arehere they goall alivearies or the ram taurus or the bull and jimimi heres gemini himself or the twins well the sun he wheels among em aye here on the coin hes just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sittingrooms all in a ring book you lie there the fact is you books must know your places youll do to give us the bare words and facts but we come in to supply the thoughts thats my small experience so far as the massachusetts calendar and bowditchs navigator and dabolls arithmetic go signs and wonders eh pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs and significant in wonders theres a clue somewhere wait a bit histhark by jove i have it look you doubloon your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter and now ill read it off straight out of the book come almanack to begin theres aries or the ramlecherous dog he begets us then taurus or the bullhe bumps us the first thing then gemini or the twinsthat is virtue and vice we try to reach virtue when lo comes cancer the crab and drags us back and here going from virtue leo a roaring lion lies in the pathhe gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw we escape and hail virgo the virgin thats our first love we marry and think to be happy for aye when pop comes libra or the scaleshappiness weighed and found wanting and while we are very sad about that lord how we suddenly jump as scorpio or the scorpion stings us in the rear we are curing the wound when whang come the arrows all round sagittarius or the archer is amusing himself as we pluck out the shafts stand aside heres the batteringram capricornus or the goat full tilt he comes rushing and headlong we are tossed when aquarius or the waterbearer pours out his whole deluge and drowns us and to wind up with pisces or the fishes we sleep theres a sermon now writ in high heaven and the sun goes through it every year and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty jollily he aloft there wheels through toil and trouble and so alow here does jolly stubb oh jollys the word for aye adieu doubloon but stop here comes little kingpost dodge round the tryworks now and lets hear what hell have to say there hes before it hell out with something presently so so hes beginning i see nothing here but a round thing made of gold and whoever raises a certain whale this round thing belongs to him so whats all this staring been about it is

done chapter leg and arm the pequod of nantucket meets the samuel enderby of london ship ahoy hast seen the white whale so cried ahab once more hailing a ship showing english colours bearing down under the stern trumpet to mouth the old man was standing in his hoisted quarterboat his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain who was carelessly reclining in his own boats bow he was a darklytanned burly goodnatured finelooking man of sixty or thereabouts dressed in a spacious roundabout that hung round him in festoons of blue pilotcloth and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussars surcoat hast seen the white whale see you this and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminating in a wooden head like a mallet man my boat cried ahab impetuously and tossing about the oars near himstand by to lower in less than a minute without quitting his little craft he and his crew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of the stranger but here a curious difficulty presented itself in the excitement of the moment ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the pequod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moments warning now it is no very easy matter for anybodyexcept those who are almost hourly used to it like whalemento clamber up a ships side from a boat on the open sea for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson so deprived of one leg and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain it has before been hinted perhaps that every little untoward circumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab and in the present instance all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship leaning over the side by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him a pair of tastefullyornamented manropes for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a onelegged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters but this awkwardness only lasted a minute because the strange captain observing at a glance how affairs stood cried out i see i seeavast heaving there jump boys and swing over the cuttingtackle as good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous and the great tackles were still aloft and the massive curved blubberhook now clean and dry was still attached to the end this was quickly lowered to ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight by pulling handoverhand upon one of the running parts of the tackle soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks and gently landed upon the capstan head with his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome the other captain advanced and ahab putting out his ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm like two swordfish blades cried out in his walrus way aye aye hearty let us shake bones togetheran arm and a legan arm that never can shrink dye see and a leg that never can run where didst thou see the white whalehow long ago the white whale said the englishman pointing his ivory arm towards the east and taking a rueful sight along it as if it had been a telescope there i saw him on the line last season and he took that arm off did he asked ahab now sliding down from the capstan and resting on the englishmans shoulder as he did so aye he was the cause of it at least and that leg too spin me the yarn said ahab how was it it was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line began the englishman i was ignorant of the white whale at that time well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales and my boat fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was too that went milling and milling round so that my boats crew could only trim dish by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale with a milkywhite head and hump all crows feet and wrinkles it was he it was he cried ahab suddenly letting out his suspended breath and harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin aye ayethey were mine_my_ irons cried ahab exultinglybut on give me a chance then said the englishman goodhumoredly well this old greatgrandfather with the white head and hump runs all afoam into the pod and goes to snapping furiously at my fastline aye i seewanted to part it free the fastfishan old tricki know him how it was exactly continued the onearmed commander i do not know but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught there somehow but we didnt know it then so that when we afterwards pulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the other whales that went off to windward all fluking seeing how matters stood and what a noble great whale it wasthe noblest and biggest i ever saw sir in my lifei resolved to capture him spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in and thinking the haphazard line would get loose or the tooth it was tangled to might draw for i have a devil of a boats crew for a pull on a whaleline seeing all this i say i jumped into my first mates boatmr mounttops here by the way captainmounttop mounttopthe captainas i was saying i jumped into mounttops boat which dye see was gunwale and gunwale with mine then and snatching the first harpoon let this old greatgrandfather have it but lord look you sirhearts and souls alive manthe next instant in a jiff i was blind as a batboth eyes outall befogged and bedeadened with black foamthe whales tail looming straight up out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble steeple no use sterning all then but as i was groping at midday with a blinding sun all crownjewels as i was groping i say after the second iron to toss it overboarddown comes the tail like a lima tower cutting my boat in two leaving each half in splinters and flukes first the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was all chips we all struck out to escape his terrible flailings i seized hold of my harpoonpole sticking in him and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish but a combing sea dashed me off and at the same instant the fish taking one good dart forwards went down like a flash and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here clapping his hand just below his shoulder yes caught me just here i say and bore me down to hells flames i was thinking when when all of a sudden thank the good god the barb ript its way along the fleshclear along the whole length of my armcame out nigh my wrist and up i floatedand that gentleman there will tell you the rest by the way captaindr bunger ships surgeon bunger my ladthe captain now bunger boy spin your part of the yarn the professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out had been all the time standing near them with nothing specific visible to denote his gentlemanly rank on board his face was an exceedingly round but sober one he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt and patched trowsers and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand and a pillbox held in the other occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains but at his superiors introduction of him to ahab he politely bowed and straightway went on to do his captains bidding it was a shocking bad wound began the whalesurgeon and taking my advice captain boomer here stood our old sammy samuel enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the onearmed captain addressing ahab go on boy stood our old sammy off to the northward to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the line but it was no usei did all i could sat up with him nights was very severe with him in the matter of diet oh very severe chimed in the patient himself then suddenly altering his voice drinking hot rum toddies with me every night till he couldnt see to put on the bandages and sending me to bed half seas over about three oclock in the morning oh ye stars he sat up with me indeed and was very severe in my diet oh a great watcher and very dietetically severe is dr bunger bunger you dog laugh out why dont ye you know youre a precious jolly rascal but heave ahead boy id rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man my captain you must have ere this perceived respected sirsaid the imperturbable godlylooking bunger slightly bowing to ahabis apt to be facetious at times he spins us many clever things of that sort but i may as well sayen passant as the french remarkthat i myselfthat is to say jack bunger late of the reverend clergyam a strict total abstinence man i never drink water cried the captain he never drinks it its a sort of fits to him fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia but go ongo on with the arm story yes i may as well said the surgeon coolly i was about observing sir before captain boomers facetious interruption that spite of my best and severest endeavors the wound kept getting worse and worse the truth was sir it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw more than two feet and several inches long i measured it with the lead line in short it grew black i knew what was threatened and off it came but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there that thing is against all rulepointing at it with the marlingspikethat is the captains work not mine he ordered the carpenter to make it he had that clubhammer there put to the end to knock some ones brains out with i suppose as he tried mine once he flies into diabolical passions sometimes do ye see this dent sirremoving his hat and brushing aside his hair and exposing a bowllike cavity in his skull but which bore not the slightest scarry trace or any token of ever having been a woundwell the captain there will tell you how that came here he knows no i dont said the captain but his mother did he was born with it oh you solemn rogue youyou bunger was there ever such another bunger in the watery world bunger when you die you ought to die in pickle you dog you should be preserved to future ages you rascal what became of the white whale now cried ahab who thus far had been impatiently listening to this byplay between the two englishmen oh cried the onearmed captain oh yes well after he sounded we didnt see him again for some time in fact as i before hinted i didnt then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick till some time afterwards when coming back to the line we heard about moby dickas some call himand then i knew it was he didst thou cross his wake again twice but could not fasten didnt want to try to aint one limb enough what should i do without this other arm and im thinking moby dick doesnt bite so much as he swallows well then interrupted bunger give him your left arm for bait to get the right do you know gentlemenvery gravely and mathematically bowing to each captain in successiondo you know gentlemen that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine providence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a mans arm and he knows it too so that what you take for the white whales malice is only his awkwardness for he never means to swallow a single limb he only thinks to terrify by feints but sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient of mine in ceylon that making believe swallow jackknives once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more when i gave him an emetic and he heaved it up in small tacks dye see no possible way for him to digest that jackknife and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system yes captain boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other why in that case the arm is yours only let the whale have another chance at you shortly thats all no thank ye bunger said the english captain hes welcome to the arm he has since i cant help it and didnt know him then but not to another one no more white whales for me ive lowered for him once and that has satisfied me there would be great glory in killing him i know that and there is a shipload of precious sperm in him but hark ye hes best let alone dont you think so captainglancing at the ivory leg he is but he will still be hunted for all that what is best let alone that accursed thing is not always what least allures hes all a magnet how long since thou sawst him last which way heading bless my soul and curse the foul fiends cried bunger stoopingly walking round ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing this mans bloodbring the thermometerits at the boiling pointhis pulse makes these planks beatsirtaking a lancet from his pocket and drawing near to ahabs arm avast roared ahab dashing him against the bulwarksman the boat which way heading good god cried the english captain to whom the question was put whats the matter he was heading east i thinkis your captain crazy whispering fedallah but fedallah putting a finger on his lip slid over the bulwarks to take the boats steering oar and ahab swinging the cuttingtackle towards him commanded the ships sailors to stand by to lower in a moment he was standing in the boats stern and the manilla men were springing to their oars in vain the english captain hailed him with back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod chapter the decanter ere the english ship fades from sight be it set down here that she hailed from london and was named after the late samuel enderby merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of enderby sons a house which in my poor whalemans opinion comes not far behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons in point of real historical interest how long prior to the year of our lord this great whaling house was in existence my numerous fishdocuments do not make plain but in that year it fitted out the first english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale though for some score of years previous ever since our valiant coffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleets pursued that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not elsewhere be it distinctly recorded here that the nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him in a fine ship the amelia fitted out for the express purpose and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly rounded cape horn and was the first among the nations to lower a whaleboat of any sort in the great south sea the voyage was a skilful and lucky one and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm the amelias example was soon followed by other ships english and american and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific were thrown open but not content with this good deed the indefatigable house again bestirred itself samuel and all his sonshow many their mother only knowsand under their immediate auspices and partly i think at their expense the british government was induced to send the sloopofwar rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea commanded by a naval postcaptain the rattler made a rattling voyage of it and did some service how much does not appear but this is not all in the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan that shipwell called the syrenmade a noble experimental cruise and it was thus that the great japanese whaling ground first became generally known the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a captain coffin a nantucketer all honor to the enderbies therefore whose house i think exists to the present day though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world the ship named after him was worthy of the honor being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way i boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the patagonian coast and drank good flip down in the forecastle it was a fine gam we had and they were all trumpsevery soul on board a short life to them and a jolly death and that fine gam i hadlong very long after old ahab touched her planks with his ivory heelit minds me of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that ship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if i ever lose sight of it flip did i say we had flip yes and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour and when the squall came for its squally off there by patagonia and all handsvisitors and allwere called to reef topsails we were so topheavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the howling gale a warning example to all drunken tars however the masts did not go overboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober that we had to pass the flip again though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste the beef was finetough but with body in it they said it was bullbeef others that it was dromedary beef but i do not know for certain how that was they had dumplings too small but substantial symmetrically globular and indestructible dumplings i fancied that you could feel them and roll them about in you after they were swallowed if you stooped over too far forward you risked their pitching out of you like billiardballs the breadbut that couldnt be helped besides it was an antiscorbutic in short the bread contained the only fresh fare they had but the forecastle was not very light and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it but all in all taking her from truck to helm considering the dimensions of the cooks boilers including his own live parchment boilers fore and aft i say the samuel enderby was a jolly ship of good fare and plenty fine flip and strong crack fellows all and capital from boot heels to hatband but why was it think ye that the samuel enderby and some other english whalers i know ofnot all thoughwere such famous hospitable ships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing i will tell you the abounding good cheer of these english whalers is matter for historical research nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale research when it has seemed needed the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders zealanders and danes from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashions touching plenty to eat and drink for as a general thing the english merchantship scrimps her crew but not so the english whaler hence in the english this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special origin which is here pointed out and will be still further elucidated during my researches in the leviathanic histories i stumbled upon an ancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it i knew must be about whalers the title was dan coopman wherefore i concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam cooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry its cooper i was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one fitz swackhammer but my friend dr snodhead a very learned man professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and st potts to whom i handed the work for translation giving him a box of sperm candles for his troublethis same dr snodhead so soon as he spied the book assured me that dan coopman did not mean the cooper but the merchant in short this ancient and learned low dutch book treated of the commerce of holland and among other subjects contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery and in this chapter it was headed smeer or fat that i found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of sail of dutch whalemen from which list as translated by dr snodhead i transcribe the following lbs of beef lbs friesland pork lbs of stock fish lbs of biscuit lbs of soft bread firkins of butter lbs texel leyden cheese lbs cheese probably an inferior article ankers of geneva barrels of beer most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading not so in the present case however where the reader is flooded with whole pipes barrels quarts and gills of good gin and good cheer at the time i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer beef and bread during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me capable of a transcendental and platonic application and furthermore i compiled supplementary tables of my own touching the probable quantity of stockfish etc consumed by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen whale fishery in the first place the amount of butter and texel and leyden cheese consumed seems amazing i impute it though to their naturally unctuous natures being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar seas on the very coasts of that esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil the quantity of beer too is very large barrels now as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea did not much exceed three months say and reckoning men to each of their fleet of sail we have low dutch seamen in all therefore i say we have precisely two barrels of beer per man for a twelve weeks allowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that ankers of gin now whether these gin and beer harpooneers so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a boats head and take good aim at flying whales this would seem somewhat improbable yet they did aim at them and hit them too but this was very far north be it remembered where beer agrees well with the constitution upon the equator in our southern fishery beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the masthead and boozy in his boat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford but no more enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers and that the english whalers have not neglected so excellent an example for say they when cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out of the world get a good dinner out of it at least and this empties the decanter chapter a bower in the arsacides hitherto in descriptively treating of the sperm whale i have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features but to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him it behooves me now to unbutton him still further and untagging the points of his hose unbuckling his garters and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones set him before you in his ultimatum that is to say in his unconditional skeleton but how now ishmael how is it that you a mere oarsman in the fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lectures on the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a specimen rib for exhibition explain thyself ishmael can you land a fullgrown whale on your deck for examination as a cook dishes a roastpig surely not a veritable witness have you hitherto been ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams the rafters ridgepole sleepers and underpinnings making up the framework of leviathan and belike of the tallowvats dairyrooms butteries and cheeseries in his bowels i confess that since jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless i have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature in a ship i belonged to a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons and for the heads of the lances think you i let that chance go without using my boathatchet and jackknife and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub and as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge i am indebted to my late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides for being at tranque years ago when attached to the tradingship dey of algiers i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays with the lord of tranque at his retired palm villa at pupella a seaside glen not very far distant from what our sailors called bambootown his capital among many other fine qualities my royal friend tranquo being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu had brought together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices chiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromatic canoes and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders the wonderfreighted tributerendering waves had cast upon his shores chief among these latter was a great sperm whale which after an unusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his head against a cocoanut tree whose plumagelike tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet when the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathomdeep enfoldings and the bones become dust dry in the sun then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it the ribs were hung with trophies the vertebræ were carved with arsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapory spout while suspended from a bough the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees like the hairhung sword that so affrighted damocles it was a wondrous sight the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen the trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the industrious earth beneath was as a weavers loom with a gorgeous carpet on it whereof the groundvine tendrils formed the warp and woof and the living flowers the figures all the trees with all their laden branches all the shrubs and ferns and grasses the messagecarrying air all these unceasingly were active through the lacings of the leaves the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure oh busy weaver unseen weaverpauseone wordwhither flows the fabric what palace may it deck wherefore all these ceaseless toilings speak weaverstay thy handbut one single word with thee naythe shuttle fliesthe figures float from forth the loom the freshetrushing carpet for ever slides away the weavergod he weaves and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal voice and by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it for even so it is in all material factories the spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles those same words are plainly heard without the walls bursting from the opened casements thereby have villainies been detected ah mortal then be heedful for so in all this din of the great worlds loom thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar now amid the green liferestless loom of that arsacidean wood the great white worshipped skeleton lay lounginga gigantic idler yet as the everwoven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven over with the vines every month assuming greener fresher verdure but himself a skeleton life folded death death trellised life the grim god wived with youthful life and begat him curlyheaded glories now when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale and saw the skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu he laughed but more i marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine to and fro i paced before this skeletonbrushed the vines asidebroke through the ribsand with a ball of arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid its many winding shaded colonnades and arbours but soon my line was out and following it back i emerged from the opening where i entered i saw no living thing within naught was there but bones cutting me a green measuringrod i once more dived within the skeleton from their arrowslit in the skull the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib how now they shouted darst thou measure this our god thats for us aye priestswell how long do ye make him then but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them concerning feet and inches they cracked each others sconces with their yardsticksthe great skull echoedand seizing that lucky chance i quickly concluded my own admeasurements these admeasurements i now propose to set before you but first be it recorded that in this matter i am not free to utter any fancied measurement i please because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to to test my accuracy there is a leviathanic museum they tell me in hull england one of the whaling ports of that country where they have some fine specimens of finbacks and other whales likewise i have heard that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire they have what the proprietors call the only perfect specimen of a greenland or river whale in the united states moreover at a place in yorkshire england burton constable by name a certain sir clifford constable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of moderate size by no means of the fullgrown magnitude of my friend king tranquos in both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and sir clifford because he was lord of the seignories of those parts sir cliffords whale has been articulated throughout so that like a great chest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bony cavitiesspread out his ribs like a gigantic fanand swing all day upon his lower jaw locks are to be put upon some of his trapdoors and shutters and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead the skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm where i had them tattooed as in my wild wanderings at that period there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics but as i was crowded for space and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was then composingat least what untattooed parts might remaini did not trouble myself with the odd inches nor indeed should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale chapter measurement of the whales skeleton in the first place i wish to lay before you a particular plain statement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit such a statement may prove useful here according to a careful calculation i have made and which i partly base upon captain scoresbys estimate of seventy tons for the largest sized greenland whale of sixty feet in length according to my careful calculation i say a sperm whale of the largest magnitude between eightyfive and ninety feet in length and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants think you not then that brains like yoked cattle should be put to this leviathan to make him at all budge to any landsmans imagination having already in various ways put before you his skull spouthole jaw teeth tail forehead fins and divers other parts i shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones but as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as it is by far the most complicated part and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or under your arm as we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view in length the sperm whales skeleton at tranque measured seventytwo feet so that when fully invested and extended in life he must have been ninety feet long for in the whale the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body of this seventytwo feet his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet leaving some fifty feet of plain backbone attached to this backbone for something less than a third of its length was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals to me this vast ivoryribbed chest with the long unrelieved spine extending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembled the hull of a great ship newlaid upon the stocks when only some twenty of her naked bowribs are inserted and the keel is otherwise for the time but a long disconnected timber the ribs were ten on a side the first to begin from the neck was nearly six feet long the second third and fourth were each successively longer till you came to the climax of the fifth or one of the middle ribs which measured eight feet and some inches from that part the remaining ribs diminished till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches in general thickness they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length the middle ribs were the most arched in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams in considering these ribs i could not but be struck anew with the circumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form the largest of the tranque ribs one of the middle ones occupied that part of the fish which in life is greatest in depth now the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part besides for some way where i now saw but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowels still more for the ample fins i here saw but a few disordered joints and in place of the weighty and majestic but boneless flukes an utter blank how vain and foolish then thought i for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood no only in the heart of quickest perils only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out but the spine for that the best way we can consider it is with a crane to pile its bones high up on end no speedy enterprise but now its done it looks much like pompeys pillar there are forty and odd vertebræ in all which in the skeleton are not locked together they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a gothic spire forming solid courses of heavy masonry the largest a middle one is in width something less than three feet and in depth more than four the smallest where the spine tapers away into the tail is only two inches in width and looks something like a white billiardball i was told that there were still smaller ones but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins the priests children who had stolen them to play marbles with thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple childs play chapter the fossil whale from his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge amplify and generally expatiate would you you could not compress him by good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail and the yards he measures about the waist only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlopdeck of a lineofbattleship since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities it now remains to magnify him in an archæological fossiliferous and antediluvian point of view applied to any other creature than the leviathanto an ant or a fleasuch portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent but when leviathan is the text the case is altered fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary and here be it said that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations i have invariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson expressly purchased for that purpose because that famous lexicographers uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me one often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject though it may seem but an ordinary one how then with me writing of this leviathan unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals give me a condors quill give me vesuvius crater for an inkstand friends hold my arms for in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this leviathan they weary me and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep as if to include the whole circle of the sciences and all the generations of whales and men and mastodons past present and to come with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not excluding its suburbs such and so magnifying is the virtue of a large and liberal theme we expand to its bulk to produce a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme no great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea though many there be who have tried it ere entering upon the subject of fossil whales i present my credentials as a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous time i have been a stonemason and also a great digger of ditches canals and wells winevaults cellars and cisterns of all sorts likewise by way of preliminary i desire to remind the reader that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the tertiary formations seem the connecting or at any rate intercepted links between the antichronical creatures and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the ark all the fossil whales hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period which is the last preceding the superficial formations and though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects to justify their taking rank as cetacean fossils detached broken fossils of preadamite whales fragments of their bones and skeletons have within thirty years past at various intervals been found at the base of the alps in lombardy in france in england in scotland and in the states of louisiana mississippi and alabama among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in the year was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp in napoleons time cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown leviathanic species but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year on the plantation of judge creagh in alabama the awestricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile and bestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus but some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to owen the english anatomist it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale though of a departed species a significant illustration of the fact again and again repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body so owen rechristened the monster zeuglodon and in his paper read before the london geological society pronounced it in substance one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons skulls tusks jaws ribs and vertebræ all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of seamonsters but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical leviathans their incalculable seniors i am by a flood borne back to that wondrous period ere time itself can be said to have begun for time began with man here saturns grey chaos rolls over me and i obtain dim shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics and in all the miles of this worlds circumference not an inhabitable hands breadth of land was visible then the whole world was the whales and king of creation he left his wake along the present lines of the andes and the himmalehs who can show a pedigree like leviathan ahabs harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaohs methuselah seems a schoolboy i look round to shake hands with shem i am horrorstruck at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale which having been before all time must needs exist after all humane ages are over but not alone has this leviathan left his preadamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust but upon egyptian tablets whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character we find the unmistakable print of his fin in an apartment of the great temple of denderah some fifty years ago there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere abounding in centaurs griffins and dolphins similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns gliding among them old leviathan swam as of yore was there swimming in that planisphere centuries before solomon was cradled nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale in his own osseous postdiluvian reality as set down by the venerable john leo the old barbary traveller not far from the seaside they have a temple the rafters and beams of which are made of whalebones for whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore the common people imagine that by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple no whale can pass it without immediate death but the truth of the matter is that on either side of the temple there are rocks that shoot two miles into the sea and wound the whales when they light upon em they keep a whales rib of an incredible length for a miracle which lying upon the ground with its convex part uppermost makes an arch the head of which cannot be reached by a man upon a camels back this rib says john leo is said to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it their historians affirm that a prophet who prophesyd of mahomet came from this temple and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jonas was cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple in this afric temple of the whale i leave you reader and if you be a nantucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship there chapter does the whales magnitude diminishwill he perish inasmuch then as this leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the headwaters of the eternities it may be fitly inquired whether in the long course of his generations he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires but upon investigation we find that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the tertiary system embracing a distinct geological period prior to man but of the whales found in that tertiary system those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones of all the preadamite whales yet exhumed by far the largest is the alabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton whereas we have already seen that the tapemeasure gives seventytwo feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale and i have heard on whalemens authority that sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture but may it not be that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods may it not be that since adams time they have degenerated assuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as pliny and the ancient naturalists generally for pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk and aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in lengthrope walks and thames tunnels of whales and even in the days of banks and solander cookes naturalists we find a danish member of the academy of sciences setting down certain iceland whales reydansiskur or wrinkled bellies at one hundred and twenty yards that is three hundred and sixty feet and lacépède the french naturalist in his elaborate history of whales in the very beginning of his work page sets down the right whale at one hundred metres three hundred and twentyeight feet and this work was published so late as ad but will any whaleman believe these stories no the whale of today is as big as his ancestors in plinys time and if ever i go where pliny is i a whaleman more than he was will make bold to tell him so because i cannot understand how it is that while the egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even pliny was born do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian in his socks and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest egyptian and nineveh tablets by the relative proportions in which they are drawn just as plainly prove that the highbred stallfed prize cattle of smithfield not only equal but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of pharaohs fat kine in the face of all this i will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated but still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the more recondite nantucketers whether owing to the almost omniscient lookouts at the mastheads of the whaleships now penetrating even through behrings straits and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts the moot point is whether leviathan can long endure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters and the last whale like the last man smoke his last pipe and then himself evaporate in the final puff comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo which not forty years ago overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of illinois and missouri and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunderclotted brows upon the sites of populous rivercapitals where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction but you must look at this matter in every light though so short a period agonot a good lifetimethe census of the buffalo in illinois exceeded the census of men now in london and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man yet the far different nature of the whalehunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the leviathan forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whales for fortyeight months think they have done extremely well and thank god if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish whereas in the days of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west when the far west in whose sunset suns still rise was a wilderness and a virgin the same number of moccasined men for the same number of months mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships would have slain not forty but forty thousand and more buffaloes a fact that if need were could be statistically stated nor considered aright does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the sperm whale for example that in former years the latter part of the last century say these leviathans in small pods were encountered much oftener than at present and in consequence the voyages were not so prolonged and were also much more remunerative because as has been elsewhere noticed those whales influenced by some views to safety now swim the seas in immense caravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokes and pods and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated unfrequent armies that is all and equally fallacious seems the conceit that because the socalled whalebone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them hence that species also is declining for they are only being driven from promontory to cape and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets then be sure some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle furthermore concerning these last mentioned leviathans they have two firm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remain impregnable and as upon the invasion of their valleys the frosty swiss have retreated to their mountains so hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas the whalebone whales can at last resort to their polar citadels and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmed circle of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man but as perhaps fifty of these whalebone whales are harpooned for one cachalot some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions but though for some time past a number of these whales not less than have been annually slain on the nor west coast by the americans alone yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe yet what shall we say to harto the historian of goa when he tells us that at one hunting the king of siam took elephants that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes and there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants which have now been hunted for thousands of years by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by all the successive monarchs of the eastif they still survive there in great numbers much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since he has a pasture to expatiate in which is precisely twice as large as all asia both americas europe and africa new holland and all the isles of the sea combined moreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity of whales their probably attaining the age of a century and more therefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generations must be contemporary and what that is we may soon gain some idea of by imagining all the graveyards cemeteries and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men women and children who were alive seventyfive years ago and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe wherefore for all these things we account the whale immortal in his species however perishable in his individuality he swam the seas before the continents broke water he once swam over the site of the tuileries and windsor castle and the kremlin in noahs flood he despised noahs ark and if ever the world is to be again flooded like the netherlands to kill off its rats then the eternal whale will still survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood spout his frothed defiance to the skies chapter ahabs leg the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel enderby of london had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a halfsplintering shock and when after gaining his own deck and his own pivothole there he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman it was as ever something about his not steering inflexibly enough then the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench that though it still remained entire and to all appearances lusty yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy and indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all his pervading mad recklessness ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood for it had not been very long prior to the pequods sailing from nantucket that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground and insensible by some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty his ivory limb having been so violently displaced that it had stakewise smitten and all but pierced his groin nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured nor at the time had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove so equally with every felicity all miserable events do naturally beget their like yea more than equally thought ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy for not to hint of this that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world but on the contrary shall be followed by the joychildlessness of all hells despair whereas some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing for thought ahab while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mystic significance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracingsout not belie the obvious deduction to trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods so that in the face of all the glad haymaking suns and soft cymballing round harvestmoons we must needs give in to this that the gods themselves are not for ever glad the ineffaceable sad birthmark in the brow of man is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers unwittingly here a secret has been divulged which perhaps might more properly in set way have been disclosed before with many other particulars concerning ahab always had it remained a mystery to some why it was that for a certain period both before and after the sailing of the pequod he had hidden himself away with such grandlamalike exclusiveness and for that one interval sought speechless refuge as it were among the marble senate of the dead captain pelegs bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate though indeed as touching all ahabs deeper part every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light but in the end it all came out this one matter did at least that direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness and not only this but to that evercontracting dropping circle ashore who for any reason possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him to that timid circle the above hinted casualtyremaining as it did moodily unaccounted for by ahabinvested itself with terrors not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails so that through their zeal for him they had all conspired so far as in them lay to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others and hence it was that not till a considerable interval had elapsed did it transpire upon the pequods decks but be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire have to do or not with earthly ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he took plain practical procedureshe called the carpenter and when that functionary appeared before him he bade him without delay set about making a new leg and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jawivory sperm whale which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a careful selection of the stoutest clearestgrained stuff might be secured this done the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night and to provide all the fittings for it independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use moreover the ships forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold and to accelerate the affair the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed chapter the carpenter seat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn and take high abstracted man alone and he seems a wonder a grandeur and a woe but from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates both contemporary and hereditary but most humble though he was and far from furnishing an example of the high humane abstraction the pequods carpenter was no duplicate hence he now comes in person on this stage like all seagoing ship carpenters and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels he was to a certain offhanded practical extent alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own the carpenters pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material but besides the application to him of the generic remark above this carpenter of the pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship upon a three or four years voyage in uncivilized and fardistant seas for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary dutiesrepairing stove boats sprung spars reforming the shape of clumsybladed oars inserting bulls eyes in the deck or new treenails in the side planks and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes both useful and capricious the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold was his vicebench a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices of different sizes and both of iron and of wood at all times except when whales were alongside this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the tryworks a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole the carpenter claps it into one of his everready vices and straightway files it smaller a lost landbird of strange plumage strays on board and is made a captive out of clean shaved rods of rightwhale bone and crossbeams of sperm whale ivory the carpenter makes a pagodalooking cage for it an oarsman sprains his wrist the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar screwing each oar in his big vice of wood the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation a sailor takes a fancy to wear sharkbone earrings the carpenter drills his ears another has the toothache the carpenter out pincers and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation whirling round the handle of his wooden vice the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth thus this carpenter was prepared at all points and alike indifferent and without respect in all teeth he accounted bits of ivory heads he deemed but topblocks men themselves he lightly held for capstans but while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence but not precisely so for nothing was this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were impersonal i say for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes still eternally holds its peace and ignores you though you dig foundations for cathedrals yet was this halfhorrible stolidity in him involving too as it appeared an allramifying heartlessnessyet was it oddly dashed at times with an old crutchlike antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noahs ark was it that this old carpenter had been a lifelong wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered no moss but what is more had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him he was a stript abstract an unfractioned integral uncompromised as a newborn babe living without premeditated reference to this world or the next you might almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence for in his numerous trades he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct or simply because he had been tutored to it or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process he was a pure manipulator his brain if he had ever had one must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers he was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful _multum in parvo_ sheffield contrivances assuming the exteriorthough a little swelledof a common pocket knife but containing not only blades of various sizes but also screwdrivers corkscrews tweezers awls pens rulers nailfilers countersinkers so if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screwdriver all they had to do was to open that part of him and the screw was fast or if for tweezers take him up by the legs and there they were yet as previously hinted this omnitooled openandshut carpenter was after all no mere machine of an automaton if he did not have a common soul in him he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty what that was whether essence of quicksilver or a few drops of hartshorn there is no telling but there it was and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more and this it was this same unaccountable cunning lifeprinciple in him this it was that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his body was a sentrybox and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the time to keep himself awake chapter ahab

that might puzzle a little but a mere shinbonewhy its easy as making hoppoles only i should like to put a good finish on time time if i but only had the time i could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever _sneezes_ scraped to a lady in a parlor those buckskin legs and calves of legs ive seen in shop windows wouldnt compare at all they soak water they do and of course get rheumatic and have to be doctored _sneezes_ with washes and lotions just like live legs there before i saw it off now i must call his old mogulship and see whether the length will be all right too short if anything i guess ha thats the heel we are in luck here he comes or its somebody else thats certain ahab _advancing_ _during the ensuing scene the carpenter continues sneezing at times_ well manmaker just in time sir if the captain pleases i will now mark the length let me measure sir measured for a leg good well its not the first time about it there keep thy finger on it this is a cogent vice thou hast here carpenter let me feel its grip once so so it does pinch some oh sir it will break bonesbeware beware no fear i like a good grip i like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold man whats prometheus about therethe blacksmith i meanwhats he about he must be forging the bucklescrew sir now right its a partnership he supplies the muscle part he makes a fierce red flame there aye sir he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work umm so he must i do deem it now a most meaning thing that that old greek prometheus who made men they say should have been a blacksmith and animated them with fire for whats made in fire must properly belong to fire and so hells probable how the soot flies this must be the remainder the greek made the africans of carpenter when hes through with that buckle tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulderblades theres a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack sir hold while prometheus is about it ill order a complete man after a desirable pattern

and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains and let me seeshall i order eyes to see outwards no but put a skylight on top of his head to illuminate inwards there take the order and away now whats he speaking about and whos he speaking to i should like to know shall i keep standing here _aside_ tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome heres one no no no i must have a lantern ho ho thats it hey here are two sir one will serve my turn what art thou thrusting that thiefcatcher into my face for man thrusted light is worse than presented pistols i thought sir that you spoke to carpenter carpenter why thatsbut noa very tidy and i may say an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here carpenteror wouldst thou rather work in clay sirclay clay sir thats mud we leave clay to ditchers sir the fellows impious what art thou sneezing about bone is rather dusty sir take the hint then and when thou art dead never bury thyself under living peoples noses siroh ahi guess soyesoh dear look ye carpenter i dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman eh well then will it speak thoroughly well for thy work if when i come to mount this leg thou makest i shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it that is carpenter my old lost leg the flesh and blood one i mean canst thou not drive that old adam away truly sir i begin to understand somewhat now yes i have heard something curious on that score sir how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar but it will be still pricking him at times may i humbly ask if it be really so sir it is man look put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was so now here is only one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the soul where thou feelest tingling life there exactly there there to a hair do i ist a riddle i should humbly call it a poser sir hist then how dost thou know that some entire living thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest aye and standing there in thy spite in thy most solitary hours then dost thou not fear eavesdroppers hold dont speak and if i still feel the smart of my crushed leg though it be now so long dissolved then why mayst not thou carpenter feel the fiery pains of hell for ever and without a body hah good lord truly sir if it comes to that i must calculate over again i think i didnt carry a small figure sir look ye puddingheads should never grant premiseshow long before the leg is done perhaps an hour sir bungle away at it then and bring it to me _turns to go_ oh life here i am proud as greek god and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on cursed be that mortal interindebtedness which will not do away with ledgers i would be free as air and im down in the whole worlds books i am so rich i could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest prætorians at the auction of the roman empire which was the worlds and yet i owe for the flesh in the tongue i brag with by heavens ill get a crucible and into it and dissolve myself down to one small compendious vertebra so carpenter _resuming his work_ well well

thats only haphazardlike then a short little old body like me should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall heronbuilt captains the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick and theres a great cry for lifeboats and heres the herons leg long and slim sure enough now for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime and that must be because they use them mercifully as a tenderhearted old lady uses her rolypoly old coachhorses but ahab oh hes a hard driver look driven one leg to death and spavined the other for life and now wears out bone legs by the cord halloa there you smut bear a hand there with those screws and lets finish it before the resurrection fellow comes acalling with his horn for all legs true or false as brewerymen go round collecting old beer barrels to fill em up again what a leg this is it looks like a real live leg filed down to nothing but the core hell be standing on this tomorrow hell be taking altitudes on it halloa i almost forgot the little oval slate smoothed ivory where he figures up the latitude so so chisel file and sandpaper now chapter ahab and starbuck in the cabin according to usage they were pumping the ship next morning and lo no inconsiderable oil came up with the water the casks below must have sprung a bad leak much concern was shown and starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair in spermwhalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench the casks with seawater which afterwards at varying intervals is removed by the ships pumps hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight while by the changed character of the withdrawn water the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo now from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosa and the bashee isles between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the china waters into the pacific and so starbuck found ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the japanese islandsniphon matsmai and sikoke with his snowwhite new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long pruninghook of a jackknife in his hand the wondrous old man with his back to the gangway door was wrinkling his brow and tracing his old courses again whos there hearing the footstep at the door but not turning round to it on deck begone captain ahab mistakes it is i the oil in the hold is leaking sir we must up burtons and break out up burtons and break out now that we are nearing japan heaveto here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year what we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving sir so it is so it is if we get it i was speaking of the oil in the hold sir and i was not speaking or thinking of that at all begone let it leak im all aleak myself aye leaks in leaks not only full of leaky casks but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship and thats a far worse plight than the pequods man yet i dont stop to plug my leak for who can find it in the deeploaded hull or how hope to plug it even if found in this lifes howling gale starbuck ill not have the burtons hoisted what will the owners say sir let the owners stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoons what cares ahab owners owners thou art always prating to me starbuck about those miserly owners as if the owners were my conscience but look ye the only real owner of anything is its commander and hark ye my conscience is in this ships keelon deck captain ahab said the reddening mate moving further into the cabin with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself a better man than i might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man aye and in a happier captain ahab devils dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of meon deck nay sir not yet i do entreat and i do dare sirto be forbearing shall we not understand each other better than hitherto captain ahab ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of most southseamens cabin furniture and pointing it towards starbuck exclaimed there is one god that is lord over the earth and one captain that is lord over the pequodon deck for an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate and his fiery cheeks you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube but mastering his emotion he half calmly rose and as he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said thou hast outraged not insulted me sir but for that i ask thee not to beware of starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of thyself old man he waxes brave but nevertheless obeys most careful bravery that murmured ahab as starbuck disappeared whats that he saidahab beware of ahabtheres something there then unconsciously using the musket for a staff with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed and returning the gun to the rack he went to the deck thou art but too good a fellow starbuck he said lowly to the mate then raising his voice to the crew furl the tgallantsails and closereef the topsails fore and aft back the mainyard up burton and break out in the mainhold it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was that as respecting starbuck ahab thus acted it may have been a flash of honesty in him or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection however transient in the important chief officer of his ship however it was his orders were executed and the burtons were hoisted chapter queequeg in his coffin upon searching it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound and that the leak must be further off so it being calm weather they broke out deeper and deeper disturbing the slumbers of the huge groundtier butts and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above so deep did they go and so ancient and corroded and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons that you almost looked next for some mouldy cornerstone cask containing coins of captain noah with copies of the posted placards vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood tierce after tierce too of water and bread and beef and shooks of staves and iron bundles of hoops were hoisted out till at last the piled decks were hard to get about and the hollow hull echoed under foot as if you were treading over empty catacombs and reeled and rolled in the sea like an airfreighted demijohn topheavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all aristotle in his head well was it that the typhoons did not visit them then now at this time it was that my poor pagan companion and fast bosomfriend queequeg was seized with a fever which brought him nigh to his endless end be it said that in this vocation of whaling sinecures are unknown dignity and danger go hand in hand till you get to be captain the higher you rise the harder you toil so with poor queequeg who as harpooneer must not only face all the rage of the living whale butas we have elsewhere seenmount his dead back in a rolling sea and finally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage to be short among whalemen the harpooneers are the holders so called poor queequeg when the ship was about half disembowelled you should have stooped over the hatchway and peered down upon him there where stripped to his woollen drawers the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well and a well or an icehouse it somehow proved to him poor pagan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweatings he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever and at last after some days suffering laid him in his hammock close to the very sill of the door of death how he wasted and wasted away in those few longlingering days till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing but as all else in him thinned and his cheekbones grew sharper his eyes nevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened and like circles on the water which as they grow fainter expand so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding like the rings of eternity an awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage and saw as strange things in his face as any beheld who were bystanders when zoroaster died for whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man never yet was put into words or books and the drawing near of death which alike levels all alike impresses all with a last revelation which only an author from the dead could adequately tell so thatlet us say it againno dying chaldee or greek had higher and holier thoughts than those whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor queequeg as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest and the oceans invisible floodtide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven not a man of the crew but gave him up and as for queequeg himself what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked he called one to him in the grey morning watch when the day was just breaking and taking his hand said that while in nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood like the rich warwood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had learned that all whalemen who died in nantucket were laid in those same dark canoes and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him for it was not unlike the custom of his own race who after embalming a dead warrior stretched him out in his canoe and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes for not only do they believe that the stars are isles but that far beyond all visible horizons their own mild uncontinented seas interflow with the blue heavens and so form the white breakers of the milky way he added that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual seacustom tossed like something vile to the deathdevouring sharks no he desired a canoe like those of nantucket all the more congenial to him being a whaleman that like a whaleboat these coffincanoes were without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering and much leeway adown the dim ages now when this strange circumstance was made known aft the carpenter was at once commanded to do queequegs bidding whatever it might include there was some heathenish coffincoloured old lumber aboard which upon a long previous voyage had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the lackaday islands and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made no sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order than taking his rule he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character proceeded into the forecastle and took queequegs measure with great accuracy regularly chalking queequegs person as he shifted the rule ah poor fellow hell have to die now ejaculated the long island sailor going to his vicebench the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities this done he marshalled the planks and his tools and to work when the last nail was driven and the lid duly planed and fitted he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction overhearing the indignant but halfhumorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away queequeg to every ones consternation commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him nor was there any denying him seeing that of all mortals some dying men are the most tyrannical and certainly since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore the poor fellows ought to be indulged leaning over in his hammock queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye he then called for his harpoon had the wooden stock drawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat all by his own request also biscuits were then ranged round the sides within a flask of fresh water was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot and a piece of sailcloth being rolled up for a pillow queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed that he might make trial of its comforts if any it had he lay without moving a few minutes then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god yojo then crossing his arms on his breast with yojo between he called for the coffin lid hatch he called it to be placed over him the head part turned over with a leather hinge and there lay queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view rarmai it will do it is easy he murmured at last and signed to be replaced in his hammock but ere this was done pip who had been slily hovering near by all this while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sobbings took him by the hand in the other holding his tambourine poor rover will ye never have done with all this weary roving where go ye now but if the currents carry ye to those sweet antilles where the beaches are only beat with waterlilies will ye do one little errand for me seek out one pip whos now been missing long i think hes in those far antilles if ye find him then comfort him for he must be very sad for look hes left his tambourine behindi found it rigadig dig dig now queequeg die and ill beat ye your dying march i have heard murmured starbuck gazing down the scuttle that in violent fevers men all ignorance have talked in ancient tongues and that when the mystery is probed it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars so to my fond faith poor pip in this strange sweetness of his lunacy brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes where learned he that but therehark he speaks again but more wildly now form two and two lets make a general of him ho wheres his harpoon lay it across hererigadig dig dig huzza oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow queequeg dies gamemind ye that queequeg dies gametake ye good heed of that queequeg dies game i say game game game but base little pip he died a coward died all ashiverout upon pip hark ye if ye find pip tell all the antilles hes a runaway a coward a coward a coward tell them he jumped from a whaleboat id never beat my tambourine over base pip and hail him general if he were once more dying here no no shame upon all cowardsshame upon them let em go drown like pip that jumped from a whaleboat shame shame during all this queequeg lay with closed eyes as if in a dream pip was led away and the sick man was replaced in his hammock but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death now that his coffin was proved a good fit queequeg suddenly rallied soon there seemed no need of the carpenters box and thereupon when some expressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that the cause of his sudden convalescence was thisat a critical moment he had just recalled a little duty ashore which he was leaving undone and therefore had changed his mind about dying he could not die yet he averred they asked him then whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure he answered certainly in a word it was queequegs conceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a gale or some violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort now there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized that while a sick civilized man may be six months convalescing generally speaking a sick savage is almost halfwell again in a day so in good time my queequeg gained strength and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days but eating with a vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet threw out his arms and legs gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon pronounced himself fit for a fight with a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a seachest and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order there many spare hours he spent in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings and it seemed that hereby he was striving in his rude way to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic marks had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth so that queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one volume but whose mysteries not even himself could read though his own live heart beat against them and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed and so be unsolved to the last and this thought it must have been which suggested to ahab that wild exclamation of his when one morning turning away from surveying poor queequegoh devilish tantalization of the gods chapter the pacific when gliding by the bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great south sea were it not for other things i could have greeted my dear pacific with uncounted thanks for now the long supplication of my youth was answered that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue there is one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath like those fabled undulations of the ephesian sod over the buried evangelist st john and meet it is that over these seapastures widerolling watery prairies and potters fields of all four continents the waves should rise and fall and ebb and flow unceasingly for here millions of mixed shades and shadows drowned dreams somnambulisms reveries all that we call lives and souls lie dreaming dreaming still tossing like slumberers in their beds the everrolling waves but made so by their restlessness to any meditative magian rover this serene pacific once beheld must ever after be the sea of his adoption it rolls the midmost waters of the world the indian ocean and atlantic being but its arms the same waves wash the moles of the newbuilt californian towns but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of asiatic lands older than abraham while all between float milkyways of coral isles and lowlying endless unknown archipelagoes and impenetrable japans thus this mysterious divine pacific zones the worlds whole bulk about makes all coasts one bay to it seems the tidebeating heart of earth lifted by those eternal swells you needs must own the seductive god bowing your head to pan but few thoughts of pan stirred ahabs brain as standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the bashee isles in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea that sea in which the hated white whale must even then be swimming launched at length upon these almost final waters and gliding towards the japanese cruisingground the old mans purpose intensified itself his firm lips met like the lips of a vice the delta of his foreheads veins swelled like overladen brooks in his very sleep his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull stern all the white whale spouts thick blood chapter the blacksmith availing himself of the mild summercool weather that now reigned in these latitudes and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated perth the begrimed blistered old blacksmith had not removed his portable forge to the hold again after concluding his contributory work for ahabs leg but still retained it on deck fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen and harpooneers and bowsmen to do some little job for them altering or repairing or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture often he would be surrounded by an eager circle all waiting to be served holding boatspades pikeheads harpoons and lances and jealously watching his every sooty movement as he toiled nevertheless this old mans was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm no murmur no impatience no petulance did come from him silent slow and solemn bowing over still further his chronically broken back he toiled away as if toil were life itself and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart and so it wasmost miserable a peculiar walk in this old man a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners and to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate belated and not innocently one bitter winters midnight on the road running between two country towns the blacksmith halfstupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him and sought refuge in a leaning dilapidated barn the issue was the loss of the extremities of both feet out of this revelation part by part at last came out the four acts of the gladness and the one long and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his lifes drama he was an old man who at the age of nearly sixty had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrows technicals called ruin he had been an artisan of famed excellence and with plenty to do owned a house and garden embraced a youthful daughterlike loving wife and three blithe ruddy children every sunday went to a cheerfullooking church planted in a grove but one night under cover of darkness and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement a desperate burglar slid into his happy home and robbed them all of everything and darker yet to tell the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his familys heart it was the bottle conjuror upon the opening of that fatal cork forth flew the fiend and shrivelled up his home now for prudent most wise and economic reasons the blacksmiths shop was in the basement of his dwelling but with a separate entrance to it so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness but with vigorous pleasure to the stout ringing of her youngarmed old husbands hammer whose reverberations muffled by passing through the floors and walls came up to her not unsweetly in her nursery and so to stout labors iron lullaby the blacksmiths infants were rocked to slumber oh woe on woe oh death why canst thou not sometimes be timely hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him then had the young widow had a delicious grief and her orphans a truly venerable legendary sire to dream of in their after years and all of them a carekilling competency but death plucked down some virtuous elder brother on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family and left the worse than useless old man standing till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest why tell the whole the blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between and each blow every day grew fainter than the last the wife sat frozen at the window with tearless eyes glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children the bellows fell the forge choked up with cinders the house was sold the mother dived down into the long churchyard grass her children twice followed her thither and the houseless familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape his every woe unreverenced his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this but death is only a launching into the region of the strange untried it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense remote the wild the watery the unshored therefore to the deathlonging eyes of such men who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide does the allcontributed and allreceptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable taking terrors and wonderful newlife adventures and from the hearts of infinite pacifics the thousand mermaids sing to themcome hither brokenhearted here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death here are wonders supernatural without dying for them come hither bury thyself in a life which to your now equally abhorred and abhorring landed world is more oblivious than death come hither put up _thy_ gravestone too within the churchyard and come hither till we marry thee hearkening to these voices east and west by early sunrise and by fall of eve the blacksmiths soul responded aye i come and so perth went awhaling chapter the forge with matted beard and swathed in a bristling sharkskin apron about midday perth was standing between his forge and anvil the latter placed upon an ironwood log with one hand holding a pikehead in the coals and with the other at his forges lungs when captain ahab came along carrying in his hand a small rustylooking leathern bag while yet a little distance from the forge moody ahab paused till at last perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammering it upon the anvilthe red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights some of which flew close to ahab are these thy mother careys chickens perth they are always flying in thy wake birds of good omen too but not to alllook here they burn but thouthou livst among them without a scorch because i am scorched all over captain ahab answered perth resting for a moment on his hammer i am past scorching not easily canst thou scorch a scar well well no more thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly sanely woeful to me in no paradise myself i am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad thou shouldst go mad blacksmith say why dost thou not go mad how canst thou endure without being mad do the heavens yet hate thee that thou canst not go madwhat wert thou making there welding an old pikehead sir there were seams and dents in it and canst thou make it all smooth again blacksmith after such hard usage as it had i think so sir and i suppose thou canst smoothe almost any seams and dents never mind how hard the metal blacksmith aye sir i think i can all seams and dents but one look ye here then cried ahab passionately advancing and leaning with both hands on perths shoulders look ye here_here_can ye smoothe out a seam like this blacksmith sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow if thou couldst blacksmith glad enough would i lay my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes answer canst thou smoothe this seam oh that is the one sir said i not all seams and dents but one aye blacksmith it is the one aye man it is unsmoothable for though thou only seest it here in my flesh it has worked down into the bone of my skull_that_ is all wrinkles but away with childs play no more gaffs and pikes today look ye here jingling the leathern bag as if it were full of gold coins i too want a harpoon made one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part perth something that will stick in a whale like his own finbone theres the stuff flinging the pouch upon the anvil look ye blacksmith these are the gathered nailstubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses horseshoe stubbs sir why captain ahab thou hast here then the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work i know it old man these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers quick forge me the harpoon and forge me first twelve rods for its shank then wind and twist and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a towline quick ill blow the fire when at last the twelve rods were made ahab tried them one by one by spiralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron bolt a flaw rejecting the last one work that over again perth this done perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one when ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron as then with regular gasping hems he hammered on the anvil perth passing to him the glowing rods one after the other and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame the parsee passed silently and bowing over his head towards the fire seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil but as ahab looked up he slid aside whats that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for muttered stubb looking on from the forecastle that parsee smells fire like a fusee and smells of it himself like a hot muskets powderpan at last the shank in one complete rod received its final heat and as perth to temper it plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by the scalding steam shot up into ahabs bent face wouldst thou brand me perth wincing for a moment with the pain have i been but forging my own brandingiron then pray god not that yet i fear something captain ahab is not this harpoon for the white whale for the white fiend but now for the barbs thou must make them thyself man here are my razorsthe best of steel here and make the barbs sharp as the needlesleet of the icy sea for a moment the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them take them man i have no need for them for i now neither shave sup nor pray tillbut hereto work fashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by perth to the shank the steel soon pointed the end of the iron and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat prior to tempering them he cried to ahab to place the watercask near no nono water for that i want it of the true deathtemper ahoy there tashtego queequeg daggoo what say ye pagans will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb holding it high up a cluster of dark nods replied yes three punctures were made in the heathen flesh and the white whales barbs were then tempered ego non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli deliriously howled ahab as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood now mustering the spare poles from below and selecting one of hickory with the bark still investing it ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron a coil of new towline was then unwound and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension pressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harpstring then eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandings ahab exclaimed good and now for the seizings at one extremity the rope was unstranded and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole was then driven hard up into the socket from the lower end the rope was traced halfway along the poles length and firmly secured so with intertwistings of twine this done pole iron and ropelike the three fatesremained inseparable and ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole both hollowly ringing along every plank but ere he entered his cabin light unnatural halfbantering yet most piteous sound was heard oh pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship and mocked it chapter the gilder penetrating further and further into the heart of the japanese cruising ground the pequod was soon all astir in the fishery often in mild pleasant weather for twelve fifteen eighteen and twenty hours on the stretch they were engaged in the boats steadily pulling or sailing or paddling after the whales or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising though with but small success for their pains at such times under an abated sun afloat all day upon smooth slow heaving swells seated in his boat light as a birch canoe and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves that like hearthstone cats they purr against the gunwale these are the times of dreamy quietude when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the oceans skin one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it and would not willingly remember that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang these are the times when in his whaleboat the rover softly feels a certain filial confident landlike feeling towards the sea that he regards it as so much flowery earth and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts seems struggling forward not through high rolling waves but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie as when the western emigrants horses only show their erected ears while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure the longdrawn virgin vales the mild blue hillsides as over these there steals the hush the hum you almost swear that playwearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes in some glad maytime when the flowers of the woods are plucked and all this mixes with your most mystic mood so that fact and fancy halfway meeting interpenetrate and form one seamless whole nor did such soothing scenes however temporary fail of at least as temporary an effect on ahab but if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing oh grassy glades oh ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul in yethough long parched by the dead drought of the earthy lifein ye men yet may roll like young horses in new morning clover and for some few fleeting moments feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them would to god these blessed calms would last but the mingled mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof calms crossed by storms a storm for every calm there is no steady unretracing progress in this life we do not advance through fixed gradations and at the last one pausethrough infancys unconscious spell boyhoods thoughtless faith adolescence doubt the common doom then scepticism then disbelief resting at last in manhoods pondering repose of if but once gone through we trace the round again and are infants boys and men and ifs eternally where lies the final harbor whence we unmoor no more in what rapt ether sails the world of which the weariest will never weary where is the foundlings father hidden our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them the secret of our paternity lies in their grave and we must there to learn it and that same day too gazing far down from his boats side into that same golden sea starbuck lowly murmured loveliness unfathomable as ever lover saw in his young brides eyetell me not of thy teethtiered sharks and thy kidnapping cannibal ways let faith oust fact let fancy oust memory i look deep down and do believe and stubb fishlike with sparkling scales leaped up in that same golden light i am stubb and stubb has his history but here stubb takes oaths that he has always been jolly chapter the pequod meets the bachelor and jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind some few weeks after ahabs harpoon had been welded it was a nantucket ship the bachelor which had just wedged in her last cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatches and now in glad holiday apparel was joyously though somewhat vaingloriously sailing round among the widelyseparated ships on the ground previous to pointing her prow for home the three men at her masthead wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats from the stern a whaleboat was suspended bottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain signals ensigns and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging on every side sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm above which in her topmast crosstrees you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp as was afterwards learned the bachelor had met with the most surprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for from the ships she had met and these were stowed along the deck and in the captains and officers staterooms even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindlingwood and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oilbutt lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece in the forecastle the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests and filled them it was humorously added that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler and filled it that the steward had plugged his spare coffeepot and filled it that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them that indeed everything was filled with sperm except the captains pantaloons pockets and those he reserved to thrust his hands into in selfcomplacent testimony of his entire satisfaction as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle and drawing still nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge trypots which covered with the parchmentlike _poke_ or stomach skin of the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew on the quarterdeck the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olivehued girls who had eloped with them from the polynesian isles while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast three long island negroes with glittering fiddlebows of whale ivory were presiding over the hilarious jig meanwhile others of the ships company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the tryworks from which the huge pots had been removed you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed bastille such wild cries they raised as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea lord and master over all this scene the captain stood erect on the ships elevated quarterdeck so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion and ahab he too was standing on his quarterdeck shaggy and black with a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each others wakesone all jubilations for things passed the other all forebodings as to things to cometheir two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene come aboard come aboard cried the gay bachelors commander lifting a glass and a bottle in the air hast seen the white whale gritted ahab in reply no only heard of him but dont believe in him at all said the other goodhumoredly come aboard thou art too damned jolly sail on hast lost any men not enough to speak oftwo islanders thats allbut come aboard old hearty come along ill soon take that black from your brow come along will ye merrys the play a full ship and homewardbound how wondrous familiar is a fool muttered ahab then aloud thou art a full ship and homeward bound thou sayst well then call me an empty ship and outwardbound so go thy ways and i will mine forward there set all sail and keep her to the wind and thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other stubbornly fought against it and so the two vessels parted the crew of the pequod looking with grave lingering glances towards the receding bachelor but the bachelors men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in and as ahab leaning over the taffrail eyed the homewardbound craft he took from his pocket a small vial of sand and then looking from the ship to the vial seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together for that vial was filled with nantucket soundings chapter the dying whale not seldom in this life when on the right side fortunes favourites sail close by us we though all adroop before catch somewhat of the rushing breeze and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out so seemed it with the pequod for next day after encountering the gay bachelor whales were seen and four were slain and one of them by ahab it was far down the afternoon and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun and whale both stilly died together then such a sweetness and such plaintiveness such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the manilla isles the spanish landbreeze wantonly turned sailor had gone to sea freighted with these vesper hymns soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom ahab who had sterned off from the whale sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat for that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dyingthe turning sunwards of the head and so expiringthat strange spectacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before he turns and turns him to ithow slowly but how steadfastly his homagerendering and invoking brow with his last dying motions he too worships fire most faithful broad baronial vassal of the sunoh that these toofavouring eyes should see these toofavouring sights look here far waterlocked beyond all hum of human weal or woe in these most candid and impartial seas where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets where for long chinese ages the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to as stars that shine upon the nigers unknown source here too life dies sunwards full of faith but see no sooner dead than death whirls round the corpse and it heads some other way oh thou dark hindoo half of nature who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas thou art an infidel thou queen and too truly speakest to me in the wideslaughtering typhoon and the hushed burial of its after calm nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head and then gone round again without a lesson to me oh trebly hooped and welded hip of power oh high aspiring rainbowed jetthat one strivest this one jettest all in vain in vain oh whale dost thou seek intercedings with yon allquickening sun that only calls forth life but gives it not again yet dost thou darker half rock me with a prouder if a darker faith all thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here i am buoyed by breaths of once living things exhaled as air but water now then hail for ever hail o sea in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds his only rest born of earth yet suckled by the sea though hill and valley mothered me ye billows are my fosterbrothers chapter the whale watch the four whales slain that evening had died wide apart one far to windward one less distant to leeward one ahead one astern these last three were brought alongside ere nightfall but the windward one could not be reached till morning and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night and that boat was ahabs the waifpole was thrust upright into the dead whales spouthole and the lantern hanging from its top cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight waves which gently chafed the whales broad flank like soft surf upon a beach ahab and all his boats crew seemed asleep but the parsee who crouching in the bow sat watching the sharks that spectrally played round the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails a sound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of gomorrah ran shuddering through the air started from his slumbers ahab face to face saw the parsee and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world i have dreamed it again said he of the hearses have i not said old man that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine and who are hearsed that die on the sea but i said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea the first not made by mortal hands and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in america aye aye a strange sight that parseea hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for the pallbearers ha such a sight we shall not soon see believe it or not thou canst not die till it be seen old man and what was that saying about thyself though it come to the last i shall still go before thee thy pilot and when thou art so gone beforeif that ever befallthen ere i can follow thou must still appear to me to pilot me stillwas it not so well then did i believe all ye say oh my pilot i have here two pledges that i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it take another pledge old man said the parsee as his eyes lighted up like fireflies in the gloomhemp only can kill thee the gallows ye meani am immortal then on land and on sea cried ahab with a laugh of derisionimmortal on land and on sea both were silent again as one man the grey dawn came on and the slumbering crew arose from the boats bottom and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship chapter the quadrant the season for the line at length drew near and every day when ahab coming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the ships prow for the equator in good time the order came it was hard upon high noon and ahab seated in the bows of his highhoisted boat was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude now in that japanese sea the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy oceans immeasurable burningglass the sky looks lacquered clouds there are none the horizon floats and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of gods throne well that ahabs quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses through which to take sight of that solar fire so swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship and with his astrologicallooking instrument placed to his eye he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian meantime while his whole attention was absorbed the parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ships deck and with face thrown up like ahabs was eyeing the same sun with him only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness at length the desired observation was taken and with his pencil upon his ivory leg ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant then falling into a moments revery he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself thou seamark thou high and mighty pilot thou tellest me truly where i _am_but canst thou cast the least hint where i _shall_ be or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living where is moby dick this instant thou must be eyeing him these eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him aye and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown thither side of thee thou sun then gazing at his quadrant and handling one after the other its numerous cabalistical contrivances he pondered again and muttered foolish toy babies plaything of haughty admirals and commodores and captains the world brags of thee of thy cunning and might but what after all canst thou do but tell the poor pitiful point where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet and the hand that holds thee no not one jot more thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be tomorrow noon and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun science curse thee thou vain toy and cursed be all the things that cast mans eyes aloft to that heaven whose live vividness but scorches him as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light o sun level by nature to this earths horizon are the glances of mans eyes not shot from the crown of his head as if god had meant him to gaze on his firmament curse thee thou quadrant dashing it to the deck no longer will i guide my earthly way by thee the level ships compass and the level deadreckoning by log and by line _these_ shall conduct me and show me my place on the sea aye lighting from the boat to the deck thus i trample on thee thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high thus i split and destroy thee as the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himselfthese passed over the mute motionless parsees face unobserved he rose and glided away while awestruck by the aspect of their commander the seamen clustered together on the forecastle till ahab troubledly pacing the deck shouted outto the braces up helmsquare in in an instant the yards swung round and as the ship halfwheeled upon her heel her three firmseated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long ribbed hull seemed as the three horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed standing between the knightheads starbuck watched the pequods tumultuous way and ahabs also as he went lurching along the deck i have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow full of its tormented flaming life and i have seen it wane at last down down to dumbest dust old man of oceans of all this fiery life of thine what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes aye cried stubb but seacoal ashesmind ye that mr starbuckseacoal not your common charcoal well well i heard ahab mutter here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine swears that i must play them and no others and damn me ahab but thou actest right live in the game and die in it chapter the candles warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs the tiger of bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders gorgeous cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands so too it is that in these resplendent japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms the typhoon it will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town towards evening of that day the pequod was torn of her canvas and barepoled was left to fight a typhoon which had struck her directly ahead when darkness came on sky and sea roared and split with the thunder and blazed with the lightning that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport holding by a shroud starbuck was standing on the quarterdeck at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there while stubb and flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats but all their pains seemed naught though lifted to the very top of the cranes the windward quarter boat ahabs did not escape a great rolling sea dashing high up against the reeling ships high teetering side stove in the boats bottom at the stern and left it again all dripping through like a sieve bad work bad work mr starbuck said stubb regarding the wreck but the sea will have its way stubb for one cant fight it you see mr starbuck a wave has such a great long start before it leaps all round the world it runs and then comes the spring but as for me all the start i have to meet it is just across the deck here but never mind its all in fun so the old song says_sings_ oh jolly is the gale and a joker is the whale a flourishin his tail such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hokypoky lad is the ocean oh the scud all a flyin thats his flip only foamin when he stirs in the spicin such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hokypoky lad is the ocean oh thunder splits the ships but he only smacks his lips a tastin of this flip such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hokypoky lad is the ocean oh avast stubb cried starbuck let the typhoon sing and strike his harp here in our rigging but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace but i am not a brave man never said i was a brave man i am a coward and i sing to keep up my spirits and i tell you what it is mr starbuck theres no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat and when thats done ten to one i sing ye the doxology for a windup madman look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own what how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else never mind how foolish here cried starbuck seizing stubb by the shoulder and pointing his hand towards the weather bow markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward the very course ahab is to run for moby dick the very course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is that stove in the sternsheets man where he is wont to standhis standpoint is stove man now jump overboard and sing away if thou must i dont half understand ye whats in the wind yes yes round the cape of good hope is the shortest way to nantucket soliloquized starbuck suddenly heedless of stubbs question the gale that now hammers at us to stave us we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home yonder to windward all is blackness of doom but to leeward homewardi see it lightens up there but not with the lightning at that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness following the flashes a voice was heard at his side and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead whos there old thunder said ahab groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivothole but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire now as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into the water but as this conductor must descend to considerable depth that its end may avoid all contact with the hull and as moreover if kept constantly towing there it would be liable to many mishaps besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging and more or less impeding the vessels way in the water because of all this the lower parts of a ships lightningrods are not always overboard but are generally made in long slender links so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside or thrown down into the sea as occasion may require the rods the rods cried starbuck to the crew suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux to light ahab to his post are they overboard drop them over fore and aft quick avast cried ahab lets have fair play here though we be the weaker side yet ill contribute to raise rods on the himmalehs and andes that all the world may be secured but out on privileges let them be sir look aloft cried starbuck the corpusants the corpusants all the yardarms were tipped with a pallid fire and touched at each tripointed lightningrodend with three tapering white flames each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar blast the boat let it go cried stubb at this instant as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft so that its gunwale violently jammed his hand as he was passing a lashing blast itbut slipping backward on the deck his uplifted eyes caught the flames and immediately shifting his tone he criedthe corpusants have mercy on us all to sailors oaths are household words they will swear in the trance of the calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecate curses from the topsailyardarms when most they teeter over to a seething sea but in all my voyagings seldom have i heard a common oath when gods burning finger has been laid on the ship when his mene mene tekel upharsin has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage while this pallidness was burning aloft few words were heard from the enchanted crew who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence like a far away constellation of stars relieved against the ghostly light the gigantic jet negro daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come the parted mouth of tashtego revealed his sharkwhite teeth which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up by the preternatural light queequegs tattooing burned like satanic blue flames on his body the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft and once more the pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall a moment or two passed when starbuck going forward pushed against some one it was stubb what thinkest thou now man i heard thy cry it was not the same in the song no no it wasnt i said the corpusants have mercy on us all and i hope they will still but do they only have mercy on long faceshave they no bowels for a laugh and look ye mr starbuckbut its too dark to look hear me then i take that masthead flame we saw for a sign of good luck for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a block with spermoil dye see and so all that sperm will work up into the masts like sap in a tree yes our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candlesthats the good promise we saw at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubbs face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight glancing upwards he cried see see and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor the corpusants have mercy on us all cried stubb again at the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and the flame the parsee was kneeling in ahabs front but with his head bowed away from him while near by from the arched and overhanging rigging where they had just been engaged securing a spar a number of the seamen arrested by the glare now cohered together and hung pendulous like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping orchard twig in various enchanted attitudes like the standing or stepping or running skeletons in herculaneum others remained rooted to the deck but all their eyes upcast aye aye men cried ahab look up at it mark it well the white flame but lights the way to the white whale hand me those mainmast links there i would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it blood against fire so then turningthe last link held fast in his left hand he put his foot upon the parsee and with fixed upward eye and highflung right arm he stood erect before the lofty tripointed trinity of flames oh thou clear spirit of clear fire whom on these seas i as persian once did worship till in the sacramental act so burned by thee that to this hour i bear the scar i now know thee thou clear spirit and i now know that thy right worship is defiance to neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind and een for hate thou canst but kill and all are killed no fearless fool now fronts thee i own thy speechless placeless power but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional unintegral mastery in me in the midst of the personified impersonal a personality stands here though but a point at best whencesoeer i came wheresoeer i go yet while i earthly live the queenly personality lives in me and feels her royal rights but war is pain and hate is woe come in thy lowest form of love and i will kneel and kiss thee but at thy highest come as mere supernal power and though thou launchest navies of fullfreighted worlds theres that in here that still remains indifferent oh thou clear spirit of thy fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire i breathe it back to thee _sudden repeated flashes of lightning the nine flames leap lengthwise to thrice their previous height ahab with the rest closes his eyes his right hand pressed hard upon them_ i own thy speechless placeless power said i not so nor was it wrung from me nor do i now drop these links thou canst blind but i can then grope thou canst consume but i can then be ashes take the homage of these poor eyes and shutterhands i would not take it the lightning flashes through my skull mine eyeballs ache and ache my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded and rolling on some stunning ground oh oh yet blindfold yet will i talk to thee light though thou be thou leapest out of darkness but i am darkness leaping out of light leaping out of thee the javelins cease open eyes see or not there burn the flames oh thou magnanimous now i do glory in my genealogy but thou art but my fiery father my sweet mother i know not oh cruel what hast thou done with her there lies my puzzle but thine is greater thou knowest not how came ye hence callest thyself unbegotten certainly knowest not thy beginning hence callest thyself unbegun i know that of me which thou knowest not of thyself oh thou omnipotent there is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee thou clear spirit to whom all thy eternity is but time all thy creativeness mechanical through thee thy flaming self my scorched eyes do dimly see it oh thou foundling fire thou hermit immemorial thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle thy unparticipated grief here again with haughty agony i read my sire leap leap up and lick the sky i leap with thee i burn with thee would fain be welded with thee defyingly i worship thee the boat the boat cried starbuck look at thy boat old man ahabs harpoon the one forged at perths fire remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyond his whaleboats bow but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale forked fire as the silent harpoon burned there like a serpents tongue starbuck grasped ahab by the armgod god is against thee old man forbear tis an ill voyage ill begun ill continued let me square the yards while we may old man and make a fair wind of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this overhearing starbuck the panicstricken crew instantly ran to the bracesthough not a sail was left aloft for the moment all the aghast mates thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half mutinous cry but dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck and snatching the burning harpoon ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a ropes end petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held the men fell back in dismay and ahab again spoke all your oaths to hunt the white whale are as binding as mine and heart soul and body lungs and life old ahab is bound and that ye may know to what tune this heart beats look ye here thus i blow out the last fear and with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame as in the hurricane that sweeps the plain men fly the neighborhood of some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts so at those last words of ahabs many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay chapter the deck towards the end of the first night watch _ahab standing by the helm starbuck approaching him_ we must send down the maintopsail yard sir the band is working loose and the lee lift is halfstranded shall i strike it sir strike nothing lash it if i had skysail poles id sway them up now sirin gods namesir well the anchors are working sir shall i get them inboard strike nothing and stir nothing but lash everything the wind rises but it has not got up to my tablelands yet quick and see to itby masts and keels he takes me for the hunchbacked skipper of some coasting smack send down my maintopsail yard ho gluepots loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds and this braintruck of mine now sails amid the cloudscud shall i strike that oh none but cowards send down their braintrucks in tempest time what a hooroosh aloft there i would een take it for sublime did i not know that the colic is a noisy malady oh take medicine take medicine chapter midnightthe forecastle bulwarks _stubb and flask mounted on them and passing additional lashings over the anchors there hanging_ no stubb you may pound that knot there as much as you please but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying and how long ago is it since you said the very contrary didnt you once say that whatever ship ahab sails in that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward stop now didnt you say so well suppose i did what then ive part changed my flesh since that time why not my mind besides supposing we _are_ loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this drenching spray here why my little man you have pretty red hair but you couldnt get afire now shake yourself youre aquarius or the waterbearer flask might fill pitchers at your coat collar dont you see then that for these extra risks the marine insurance companies have extra guarantees here are hydrants flask but hark again and ill answer ye the other thing first take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here though so i can pass the rope now listen whats the mighty difference between holding a masts lightningrod in the storm and standing close by a mast that hasnt got any lightningrod at all in a storm dont you see you timberhead that no harm can come to the holder of the rod unless the mast is first struck what are you talking about then not one ship in a hundred carries rods and ahabaye man and all of uswere in no more danger then in my poor opinion than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas why you kingpost you i suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small lightningrod running up the corner of his hat like a militia officers skewered feather and trailing behind like his sash why dont ye be sensible flask its easy to be sensible why dont ye then any man with half an eye can be sensible i dont know that stubb you sometimes find it rather hard yes when a fellows soaked through its hard to be sensible thats a fact and i am about drenched with this spray never mind catch the turn there and pass it seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again tying these two anchors here flask seems like tying a mans hands behind him and what big generous hands they are to be sure these are your iron fists hey what a hold they have too i wonder flask whether the world is anchored anywhere if she is she swings with an uncommon long cable though there hammer that knot down and weve done so next to touching land lighting on deck is the most satisfactory i say just wring out my jacket skirts will ye thank ye they laugh at longtogs so flask but seems to me a long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat the tails tapering down that way serve to carry off the water dye see same with cocked hats the cocks form gableend eavetroughs flask no more monkeyjackets and tarpaulins for me i must mount a swallowtail and drive down a beaver so halloa whew there goes my tarpaulin overboard lord lord that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly this is a nasty night lad chapter midnight aloftthunder and lightning _the maintopsail yard__tashtego passing new lashings around it_ um um um stop that thunder plenty too much thunder up here whats the use of thunder um um um we dont want thunder we want rum give us a glass of rum um um um chapter the musket during the most violent shocks of the typhoon the man at the pequods jawbone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions even though preventer tackles had been attached to itfor they were slackbecause some play to the tiller was indispensable in a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses at intervals go round and round it was thus with the pequods at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion some hours after midnight the typhoon abated so much that through the strenuous exertions of starbuck and stubbone engaged forward and the other aftthe shivered remnants of the jib and fore and maintopsails were cut adrift from the spars and went eddying away to leeward like the feathers of an albatross which sometimes are cast to the winds when that stormtossed bird is on the wing the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed and a stormtrysail was set further aft so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again and the coursefor the present eastsoutheastwhich he was to steer if practicable was once more given to the helmsman for during the violence of the gale he had only steered according to its vicissitudes but as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible watching the compass meanwhile lo a good sign the wind seemed coming round astern aye the foul breeze became fair instantly the yards were squared to the lively song of _ho the fair wind ohyeho cheerly men_ the crew singing for joy that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it in compliance with the standing order of his commanderto report immediately and at any one of the twentyfour hours any decided change in the affairs of the deckstarbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breezehowever reluctantly and gloomilythan he mechanically went below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance ere knocking at his stateroom he involuntarily paused before it a moment the cabin lamptaking long swings this way and thatwas burning fitfully and casting fitful shadows upon the old mans bolted doora thin one with fixed blinds inserted in place of upper panels the isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements the loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead starbuck was an honest upright man but out of starbucks heart at that instant when he saw the muskets there strangely evolved an evil thought but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself he would have shot me once he murmured yes theres the very musket that he pointed at methat one with the studded stock let me touch itlift it strange that i who have handled so many deadly lances strange that i should shake so now loaded i must see aye aye and powder in the panthats not good best spill itwait ill cure myself of this ill hold the musket boldly while i thinki come to report a fair wind to him but how fair fair for death and doom_thats_ fair for moby dick its a fair wind thats only fair for that accursed fishthe very tube he pointed at methe very one _this_ onei hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing i handle nowaye and he would fain kill all his crew does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant and in these same perilous seas gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the errorabounding log and in this very typhoon did he not swear that he would have no lightningrods but shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ships company down to doom with himyes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my soul swears this ship will if ahab have his way if then he were this instantput aside that crime would not be his ha is he muttering in his sleep yes just therein there hes sleeping sleeping aye but still alive and soon awake again i cant withstand thee then old man not reasoning not remonstrance not entreaty wilt thou hearken to all this thou scornest flat obedience to thy own flat commands this is all thou breathest aye and sayst the men have vowd thy vow sayst all of us are ahabs great god forbidbut is there no other way no lawful waymake him a prisoner to be taken home what hope to wrest this old mans living power from his own living hands only a fool would try it say he were pinioned even knotted all over with ropes and hawsers chained down to ringbolts on this cabin floor he would be more hideous than a caged tiger then i could not endure the sight could not possibly fly his howlings all comfort sleep itself inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage what then remains the land is hundreds of leagues away and locked japan the nearest i stand alone here upon an open sea with two oceans and a whole continent between me and lawaye aye tis sois heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a wouldbe murderer in his bed tindering sheets and skin togetherand would i be a murderer then ifand slowly stealthily and half sideways looking he placed the loaded muskets end against the door on this level ahabs hammock swings within his head this way a touch and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child againoh mary maryboy boy boybut if i wake thee not to death old man who can tell to what unsounded deeps starbucks body this day week may sink with all the crew great god where art thou shall i shall ithe wind has gone down and shifted sir the fore and main topsails are reefed and set she heads her course stern all oh moby dick i clutch thy heart at last such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old mans tormented sleep as if starbucks voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak the yet levelled musket shook like a drunkards arm against the panel starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel but turning from the door he placed the deathtube in its rack and left the place hes too sound asleep mr stubb go thou down and wake him and tell him i must see to the deck here thou knowst what to say chapter the needle next morning the notyetsubsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk and striving in the pequods gurgling track pushed her on like giants palms outspread the strong unstaggering breeze abounded so that sky

rays moved on in stacks emblazonings as of crowned babylonian kings and queens reigned over everything the sea was as a crucible of molten gold that bubblingly leaps with light and heat long maintaining an enchanted silence ahab stood apart and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright suns rays produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the suns rearward place and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake ha ha my ship thou mightest well be taken now for the seachariot of the sun ho ho all ye nations before my prow i bring the sun to ye yoke on the further billows hallo a tandem i drive the sea but suddenly reined back by some counter thought he hurried towards the helm huskily demanding how the ship was heading eastsoueast sir said the frightened steersman thou liest smiting him with his clenched fist heading east at this hour in the morning and the sun astern upon this every soul was confounded for the phenomenon just then observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause thrusting his head half way into the binnacle ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses his uplifted arm slowly fell for a moment he almost seemed to stagger standing behind him starbuck looked and lo the two compasses pointed east and the pequod was as infallibly going west but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed i have it it has happened before mr starbuck last nights thunder turned our compassesthats all thou hast before now heard of such a thing i take it aye but never before has it happened to me sir said the pale mate gloomily here it must needs be said that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms the magnetic energy as developed in the mariners needle is as all know essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much marvelled at that such things should be instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal all its loadstone virtue being annihilated so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wifes knitting needle but in either case the needle never again of itself recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost and if the binnacle compasses be affected the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed compasses the old man with the sharp of his extended hand now took the precise bearing of the sun and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted shouted out his orders for the ships course to be changed accordingly the yards were hard up and once more the pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her meanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts starbuck said nothing but quietly he issued all requisite orders while stubb and flaskwho in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelingslikewise unmurmuringly acquiesced as for the men though some of them lowly rumbled their fear of ahab was greater than their fear of fate but as ever before the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed or if impressed it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible ahabs for a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries but chancing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed copper sighttubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck thou poor proud heavengazer and suns pilot yesterday i wrecked thee and today the compasses would fain have wrecked me so so but ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet mr starbucka lance without a pole a topmaul and the smallest of the sailmakers needles quick accessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do were certain prudential motives whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses besides the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles though clumsily practicable was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors without some shudderings and evil portents men said he steadily turning upon the crew as the mate handed him the things he had demanded my men the thunder turned old ahabs needles but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own that will point as true as any abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors as this was said and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow but starbuck looked away with a blow from the topmaul ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade him hold it upright without its touching the deck then with the maul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly hammered that several times the mate still holding the rod as before then going through some small strange motions with itwhether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew is uncertainhe called for linen thread and moving to the binnacle slipped out the two reversed needles there and horizontally suspended the sailneedle by its middle over one of the compasscards at first the steel went round and round quivering and vibrating at either end but at last it settled to its place when ahab who had been intently watching for this result stepped frankly back from the binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimedlook ye for yourselves if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone the sun is east and that compass swears it one after another they peered in for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs and one after another they slunk away in his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph you then saw ahab in all his fatal pride chapter the log and line while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage the log and line had but very seldom been in use owing to a confident reliance upon other means of determining the vessels place some merchantmen and many whalemen especially when cruising wholly neglect to heave the log though at the same time and frequently more for forms sake than anything else regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship as well as the presumed average rate of progression every hour it had been thus with the pequod the wooden reel and angular log attached hung long untouched just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks rains and spray had damped it sun and wind had warped it all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly but heedless of all this his mood seized ahab as he happened to glance upon the reel not many hours after the magnet scene and he remembered how his quadrant was no more and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line the ship was sailing plungingly astern the billows rolled in riots forward there heave the log two seamen came the goldenhued tahitian and the grizzly manxman take the reel one of ye ill heave they went towards the extreme stern on the ships lee side where the deck with the oblique energy of the wind was now almost dipping into the creamy sidelongrushing sea the manxman took the reel and holding it high up by the projecting handleends of the spindle round which the spool of line revolved so stood with the angular log hanging downwards till ahab advanced to him ahab stood before him and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary handcoil to toss overboard when the old manxman who was intently eyeing both him and the line made bold to speak sir i mistrust it this line looks far gone long heat and wet have spoiled it twill hold old gentleman long heat and wet have they spoiled thee thou seemst to hold or truer perhaps life holds thee not thou it i hold the spool sir but just as my captain says with these grey hairs of mine tis not worth while disputing specially with a superior wholl neer confess whats that there nows a patched professor in queen natures granitefounded college but methinks hes too subservient where wert thou born in the little rocky isle of man sir excellent thoust hit the world by that i know not sir but i was born there in the isle of man hey well the other way its good heres a man from man a man born in once independent man and now unmanned of man which is sucked inby what up with the reel the dead blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last up with it so the log was heaved the loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern and then instantly the reel began to whirl in turn jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely hold hard snap the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon the tugging log was gone i crush the quadrant the thunder turns the needles and now the mad sea parts the logline but ahab can mend all haul in here tahitian reel up manxman and look ye let the carpenter make another log and mend thou the line see to it there he goes now to him nothings happened but to me the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world haul in haul in tahitian these lines run whole and whirling out come in broken and dragging slow ha pip come to help eh pip pip whom call ye pip pip jumped from the whaleboat pips missing lets see now if ye havent fished him up here fisherman it drags hard i guess hes holding on jerk him tahiti jerk him off we haul in no cowards here ho theres his arm just breaking water a hatchet a hatchet cut it offwe haul in no cowards here captain ahab sir sir heres pip trying to get on board again peace thou crazy loon cried the manxman seizing him by the arm away from the quarterdeck the greater idiot ever scolds the lesser muttered ahab advancing hands off from that holiness where sayest thou pip was boy astern there sir astern lo lo and who art thou boy i see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes oh god that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through who art thou boy bellboy sir shipscrier ding dong ding pip pip pip one hundred pounds of clay reward for pip five feet highlooks cowardlyquickest known by that ding dong ding whos seen pip the coward there can be no hearts above the snowline oh ye frozen heavens look down here ye did beget this luckless child and have abandoned him ye creative libertines here boy ahabs cabin shall be pips home henceforth while ahab lives thou touchest my inmost centre boy thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heartstrings come lets down whats this heres velvet sharkskin intently gazing at ahabs hand and feeling it ah now had poor pip but felt so kind a thing as this perhaps he had neer been lost this seems to me sir as a manrope something that weak souls may hold by oh sir let old perth now come and rivet these two hands together the black one with the white for i will not let this go oh boy nor will i thee unless i should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here come then to my cabin lo ye believers in gods all goodness and in man all ill lo you see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man and man though idiotic and knowing not what he does yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude come i feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand than though i grasped an emperors there go two daft ones now muttered the old manxman one daft with strength the other daft with weakness but heres the end of the rotten lineall dripping too mend it eh i think we had best have a new line altogether ill see mr stubb about it chapter the lifebuoy steering now southeastward by ahabs levelled steel and her progress solely determined by ahabs level log and line the pequod held on her path towards the equator making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere long sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds over waves monotonously mild all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene at last when the ship drew near to the outskirts as it were of the equatorial fishingground and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets the watchthen headed by flaskwas startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthlylike halfarticulated wailings of the ghosts of all herods murdered innocentsthat one and all they started from their reveries and for the space of some moments stood or sat or leaned all transfixedly listening like the carved roman slave while that wild cry remained within hearing the christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids and shuddered but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled yet the grey manxmanthe oldest mariner of alldeclared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea below in his hammock ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when he came to the deck it was then recounted to him by flask not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings he hollowly laughed and thus explained the wonder those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams or some dams that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail but this only the more affected some of them because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress but also from the human look of their round heads and semiintelligent faces seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside in the sea under certain circumstances seals have more than once been mistaken for men but the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning at sunrise this man went from his hammock to his masthead at the fore and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether it was thus with the man there is now no telling but be that as it may he had not been long at his perch when a cry was hearda cry and a rushingand looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air and looking down a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea the lifebuoya long slender caskwas dropped from the stern where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose to seize it and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken so that it slowly filled and that parched wood also filled at its every pore and the studded ironbound cask followed the sailor to the bottom as if to yield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard one and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the white whale on the white whales own peculiar ground that man was swallowed up in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at the time indeed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at least as a portent for they regarded it not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged they declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before but again the old manxman said nay the lost lifebuoy was now to be replaced starbuck was directed to see to it but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end whatever that might prove to be therefore they were going to leave the ships stern unprovided with a buoy when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin a lifebuoy of a coffin cried starbuck starting rather queer that i should say said stubb it will make a good enough one said flask the carpenter here can arrange it easily bring it up theres nothing else for it said starbuck after a melancholy pause rig it carpenter do not look at me sothe coffin i mean dost thou hear me rig it and shall i nail down the lid sir moving his hand as with a hammer aye and shall i caulk the seams sir moving his hand as with a caulkingiron aye and shall i then pay over the same with pitch sir moving his hand as with a pitchpot away what possesses thee to this make a lifebuoy of the coffin and no moremr stubb mr flask come forward with me he goes off in a huff the whole he can endure at the parts he baulks now i dont like this i make a leg for captain ahab and he wears it like a gentleman but i make a bandbox for queequeg and he wont put his head into it are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin and now im ordered to make a lifebuoy of it its like turning an old coat going to bring the flesh on the other side now i dont like this cobbling sort of businessi dont like it at all its undignified its not my place let tinkers brats do tinkerings we are their betters i like to take in hand none but clean virgin fairandsquare mathematical jobs something that regularly begins at the beginning and is at the middle when midway and comes to an end at the conclusion not a cobblers job thats at an end in the middle and at the beginning at the end its the old womans tricks to be giving cobbling jobs lord what an affection all old women have for tinkers i know an old woman of sixtyfive who ran away with a baldheaded young tinker once and thats the reason i never would work for lonely widow old women ashore when i kept my jobshop in the vineyard they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me but heighho there are no caps at sea but snowcaps let me see nail down the lid caulk the seams pay over the same with pitch batten them down tight and hang it with the snapspring over the ships stern were ever such things done before with a coffin some superstitious old carpenters now would be tied up in the rigging ere they would do the job but im made of knotty aroostook hemlock i dont budge cruppered with a coffin sailing about with a graveyard tray but never mind we workers in woods make bridalbedsteads and cardtables as well as coffins and hearses we work by the month or by the job or by the profit not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work unless it be too confounded cobbling and then we stash it if we can hem ill do the job now tenderly ill have melets seehow many in the ships company all told but ive forgotten any way ill have me thirty separate turksheaded lifelines each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin then if the hull go down therell be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin a sight not seen very often beneath the sun come hammer caulkingiron pitchpot and marlingspike lets to it chapter the deck _the coffin laid upon two linetubs between the vicebench and the open hatchway the carpenter caulking its seams the string of twisted oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frockahab comes slowly from the cabingangway and hears pip following him_ back lad i will be with ye again presently he goes not this hand complies with my humor more genially than that boymiddle aisle of a church whats here lifebuoy sir mr starbucks orders oh look sir beware the hatchway thank ye man thy coffin lies handy to the vault sir the hatchway oh so it does sir so it does art not thou the legmaker look did not this stump come from thy shop i believe it did sir does the ferrule stand sir well enough but art thou not also the undertaker aye sir i patched up this thing here as a coffin for queequeg but theyve set me now to turning it into something else then tell me art thou not an arrant allgrasping intermeddling monopolising heathenish old scamp to be one day making legs and the next day coffins to clap them in and yet again lifebuoys out of those same coffins thou art as unprincipled as the gods and as much of a jackofalltrades but i do not mean anything sir i do as i do the gods again hark ye dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin the titans they say hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes and the gravedigger in the play sings spade in hand dost thou never sing sir do i sing oh im indifferent enough sir for that but the reason why the gravedigger made music must have been because there was none in his spade sir but the caulking mallet is full of it hark to it aye and thats because the lid theres a soundingboard and what in all things makes the soundingboard is thistheres naught beneath and yet a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same carpenter hast thou ever helped carry a bier and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate going in faith sir ive faith whats that why faith sir its only a sort of exclamationlikethats all sir um um go on i was about to say sir that art thou a silkworm dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself look at thy bosom despatch and get these traps out of sight he goes aft that was sudden now but squalls come sudden in hot latitudes ive heard that the isle of albemarle one of the gallipagos is cut by the equator right in the middle seems to me some sort of equator cuts yon old man too right in his middle hes always under the linefiery hot i tell ye hes looking this waycome oakum quick here we go again this wooden mallet is the cork and im the professor of musical glassestap tap _ahab to himself_ theres a sight theres a sound the greyheaded woodpecker tapping the hollow tree blind and dumb might well be envied now see that thing rests on two linetubs full of towlines a most malicious wag that fellow rattat so mans seconds tick oh how immaterial are all materials what things real are there but imponderable thoughts here nows the very dreaded symbol of grim death by a mere hap made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life a lifebuoy of a coffin does it go further can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is after all but an immortalitypreserver ill think of that but no so far gone am i in the dark side of earth that its other side the theoretic bright one seems but uncertain twilight to me will ye never have done carpenter with that accursed sound i go below let me not see that thing here when i return again now then pip well talk this over i do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee chapter the pequod meets the rachel next day a large ship the rachel was descried bearing directly down upon the pequod all her spars thickly clustering with men at the time the pequod was making good speed through the water but as the broadwinged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst and all life fled from the smitten hull bad news she brings bad news muttered the old manxman but ere her commander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in his boat ere he could hopefully hail ahabs voice was heard hast seen the white whale aye yesterday have ye seen a whaleboat adrift throttling his joy ahab negatively answered this unexpected question and would then have fain boarded the stranger when the stranger captain himself having stopped his vessels way was seen descending her side a few keen pulls and his boathook soon clinched the pequods mainchains and he sprang to the deck immediately he was recognised by ahab for a nantucketer he knew but no formal salutation was exchanged where was henot killednot killed cried ahab closely advancing how was it it seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous while three of the strangers boats were engaged with a shoal of whales which had led them some four or five miles from the ship and while they were yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head of moby dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water not very far to leeward whereupon the fourth rigged boata reserved onehad been instantly lowered in chase after a keen sail before the wind this fourth boatthe swiftest keeled of allseemed to have succeeded in fasteningat least as well as the man at the masthead could tell anything about it in the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water and after that nothing more whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers as often happens there was some apprehension but no positive alarm as yet the recall signals were placed in the rigging darkness came on and forced to pick up her three far to windward boatsere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite directionthe ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight but for the time to increase her distance from it but the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard she crowded all sailstunsail on stunsailafter the missing boat kindling a fire in her trypots for a beacon and every other man aloft on the lookout but though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her and not finding anything had again dashed on again paused and lowered her boats and though she had thus continued doing till daylight yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen the story told the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the pequod he desired that ship to unite with his own in the search by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart on parallel lines and so sweeping a double horizon as it were i will wager something now whispered stubb to flask that some one in that missing boat wore off that captains best coat mayhap his watchhes so cursed anxious to get it back who ever heard of two pious whaleships cruising after one missing whaleboat in the height of the whaling season see flask only see how pale he lookspale in the very buttons of his eyeslookit wasnt the coatit must have been the my boy my own boy is among them for gods sakei beg i conjurehere exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab who thus far had but icily received his petition for eightandforty hours let me charter your shipi will gladly pay for it and roundly pay for itif there be no other wayfor eightandforty hours onlyonly thatyou must oh you must and you _shall_ do this thing his son cried stubb oh its his son hes lost i take back the coat and watchwhat says ahab we must save that boy hes drowned with the rest on em last night said the old manx sailor standing behind them i heard all of ye heard their spirits now as it shortly turned out what made this incident of the rachels the more melancholy was the circumstance that not only was one of the captains sons among the number of the missing boats crew but among the number of the other boats crews at the same time but on the other hand separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase there had been still another son as that for a time the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity which was only solved for him by his chief mates instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whaleship in such emergencies that is when placed between jeopardized but divided boats always to pick up the majority first but the captain for some unknown constitutional reason had refrained from mentioning all this and not till forced to it by ahabs iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy a little lad but twelve years old whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a nantucketers paternal love had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race nor does it unfrequently occur that nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them for a protracted three or four years voyage in some other ship than their own so that their first knowledge of a whalemans career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a fathers natural but untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern meantime now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahab and ahab still stood like an anvil receiving every shock but without the least quivering of his own i will not go said the stranger till you say _aye_ to me do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case for _you_ too have a boy captain ahabthough but a child and nestling safely at home nowa child of your old age tooyes yes you relent i see itrun run men now and stand by to square in the yards avast cried ahabtouch not a ropeyarn then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every wordcaptain gardiner i will not do it even now i lose time goodbye goodbye god bless ye man and may i forgive myself but i must go mr starbuck look at the binnacle watch and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers then brace forward again and let the ship sail as before hurriedly turning with averted face he descended into his cabin leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit but starting from his enchantment gardiner silently hurried to the side more fell than stepped into his boat and returned to his ship soon the two ships diverged their wakes and long as the strange vessel was in view she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot however small on the sea this way and that her yards were swung round starboard and larboard she continued to tack now she beat against a head sea and again it pushed her before it while all the while her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men as three tall cherry trees when the boys are cherrying among the boughs but by her still halting course and winding woeful way you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray still remained without comfort she was rachel weeping for her children because they were not chapter the cabin _ahab moving to go on deck pip catches him by the hand to follow_ lad lad i tell thee thou must not follow ahab now the hour is coming when ahab would not scare thee from him yet would not have thee by him there is that in thee poor lad which i feel too curing to my malady like cures like and for this hunt my malady becomes my most desired health do thou abide below here where they shall serve thee as if thou wert the captain aye lad thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair another screw to it thou must be no no no ye have not a whole body sir do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg only tread upon me sir i ask no more so i remain a part of ye oh spite of million villains this makes me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity of manand a black and crazybut methinks likecureslike applies to him too he grows so sane again they tell me sir that stubb did once desert poor little pip whose drowned bones now show white for all the blackness of his living skin but i will never desert ye sir as stubb did him sir i must go with ye if thou speakest thus to me much more ahabs purpose keels up in him i tell thee no it cannot be oh good master master master weep so and i will murder thee have a care for ahab too is mad listen and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck and still know that i am there and now i quit thee thy handmet true art thou lad as the circumference to its centre so god for ever bless thee and if it come to thatgod for ever save thee let what will befall _ahab goes pip steps one step forward_ here he this instant stood i stand in his airbut im alone now were even poor pip here i could endure it but hes missing pip pip ding dong ding whos seen pip he must be up here lets try the door what neither lock nor bolt nor bar and yet theres no opening it it must be the spell he told me to stay here aye and told me this screwed chair was mine here then ill seat me against the transom in the ships full middle all her keel and her three masts before me here our old sailors say in their black seventyfours great admirals sometimes sit at table and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants ha whats this epaulets epaulets the epaulets all come crowding pass round the decanters glad to see ye fill up monsieurs what an odd feeling now when a black boys host to white men with gold lace upon their coatsmonsieurs have ye seen one pipa little negro lad five feet high hangdog look and cowardly jumped from a whaleboat onceseen him no well then fill up again captains and lets drink shame upon all cowards i name no names shame upon them put one foot upon the table shame upon all cowardshist above there i hear ivoryoh master master i am indeed downhearted when you walk over me but here ill stay though this stern strikes rocks and they bulge through and oysters come to join me chapter the hat and now that at the proper time and place after so long and wide a preliminary cruise ahaball other whaling waters sweptseemed to have chased his foe into an oceanfold to slay him the more securely there now that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered moby dickand now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters whether sinning or sinned against now it was that there lurked a something in the old mans eyes which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see as the unsetting polar star which through the livelong arctic six months night sustains its piercing steady central gaze so ahabs purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew it domineered above them so that all their bodings doubts misgivings fears were fain to hide beneath their souls and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf in this foreshadowing interval too all humor forced or natural vanished stubb no more strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove to check one alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seemed ground to finest dust and powdered for the time in the clamped mortar of ahabs iron soul like machines they dumbly moved about the deck ever conscious that the old mans despot eye was on them but did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours when he thought no glance but one was on him then you would have seen that even as ahabs eyes so awed the crews the inscrutable parsees glance awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at times affected it such an added gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah now such ceaseless shudderings shook him that the men looked dubious at him half uncertain as it seemed whether indeed he were a mortal substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen beings body and that shadow was always hovering there for not by night even had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber or go below he would stand still for hours but never sat or leaned his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly saywe two watchmen never rest nor at any time by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck unless ahab was before them either standing in his pivothole or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limitsthe mainmast and the mizen or else they saw him standing in the cabinscuttlehis living foot advanced upon the deck as if to step his hat slouched heavily over his eyes so that however motionless he stood however the days and nights were added on that he had not swung in his hammock yet hidden beneath that slouching hat they could never tell unerringly whether for all this his eyes were really closed at times or whether he was still intently scanning them no matter though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded nightdamp gathered in beads of dew upon that stonecarved coat and hat the clothes that the night had wet the next days sunshine dried upon him and so day after day and night after night he went no more beneath the planks whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for he ate in the same open air that is his two only mealsbreakfast and dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard which darkly grew all gnarled as unearthed roots of trees blown over which still grow idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure but though his whole life was now become one watch on deck and though the parsees mystic watch was without intermission as his own yet these two never seemed to speakone man to the otherunless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain openly and to the awestruck crew they seemed polelike asunder if by day they chanced to speak one word by night dumb men were both so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange at times for longest hours without a single hail they stood far parted in the starlight ahab in his scuttle the parsee by the mainmast but still fixedly gazing upon each other as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow in ahab the parsee his abandoned substance and yet somehow did ahabin his own proper self as daily hourly and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinatesahab seemed an independent lord the parsee but his slave still again both seemed yoked together and an unseen tyrant driving them the lean shade siding the solid rib for be this parsee what he may all rib and keel was solid ahab at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn his iron voice was heard from aftman the mastheadsand all through the day till after sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of the helmsmans bell was heardwhat dye seesharp sharp but when three or four days had slided by after meeting the childrenseeking rachel and no spout had yet been seen the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crews fidelity at least of nearly all except the pagan harpooneers he seemed to doubt even whether stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought but if these suspicions were really his he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them however his actions might seem to hint them i will have the first sight of the whale myselfhe said aye ahab must have the doubloon and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines and sending a hand aloft with a single sheaved block to secure to the mainmast head he received the two ends of the downwardreeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end in order to fasten it at the rail this done with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round upon his crew sweeping from one to the other pausing his glance long upon daggoo queequeg tashtego but shunning fedallah and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate saidtake the rope siri give it into thy hands starbuck then arranging his person in the basket he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last and afterwards stood near it and thus with one hand clinging round the royal mast ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and milesahead astern this side and thatwithin the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging which chances to afford no foothold the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope under these circumstances its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it because in such a wilderness of running rigging whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck and when the deckends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings it would be but a natural fatality if unprovided with a constant watchman the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea so ahabs proceedings in this matter were not unusual the only strange thing about them seemed to be that starbuck almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decisionone of those too whose faithfulness on the lookout he had seemed to doubt somewhatit was strange that this was the very man he should select for his watchman freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted persons hands now the first time ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there ten minutes one of those redbilled savage seahawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mastheads of whalemen in these latitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air then spiralized downwards and went eddying again round his head but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight your hat your hat sir suddenly cried the sicilian seaman who being posted at the mizenmasthead stood directly behind ahab though somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing them but already the sable wing was before the old mans eyes the long hooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk darted away with his prize an eagle flew thrice round tarquins head removing his cap to replace it and thereupon tanaquil his wife declared that tarquin would be king of rome but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good ahabs hat was never restored the wild hawk flew on and on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot was dimly discerned falling from that vast height into the sea chapter the pequod meets the delight the intense pequod sailed on the rolling waves and days went by the lifebuoycoffin still lightly swung and another ship most miserably misnamed the delight was descried as she drew nigh all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams called shears which in some whalingships cross the quarterdeck at the height of eight or nine feet serving to carry the spare unrigged or disabled boats upon the strangers shears were beheld the shattered white ribs and some few splintered planks of what had once been a whaleboat but you now saw through this wreck as plainly as you see through the peeled halfunhinged and bleaching skeleton of a horse hast seen the white whale look replied the hollowcheeked captain from his taffrail and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck hast killed him the harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that answered the other sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together not forged and snatching perths levelled iron from the crotch ahab held it out exclaiminglook ye nantucketer here in this hand i hold his death tempered in blood and tempered by lightning are these barbs and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin where the white whale most feels his accursed life then god keep thee old manseest thou thatpointing to the hammocki bury but one of five stout men who were alive only yesterday but were dead ere night only _that_ one i bury the rest were buried before they died you sail upon their tomb then turning to his creware ye ready there place the plank then on the rail and lift the body so thenoh godadvancing towards the hammock with uplifted handsmay the resurrection and the life brace forward up helm cried ahab like lightning to his men but the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea not so quick indeed but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism as ahab now glided from the dejected delight the strange lifebuoy hanging at the pequods stern came into conspicuous relief ha yonder look yonder men cried a foreboding voice in her wake in vain oh ye strangers ye fly our sad burial ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin chapter the symphony it was a clear steelblue day the firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that allpervading azure only the pensive air was transparently pure and soft with a womans look and the robust and manlike sea heaved with long strong lingering swells as samsons chest in his sleep hither and thither on high glided the snowwhite wings of small unspeckled birds these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air but to and fro in the deeps far down in the bottomless blue rushed mighty leviathans swordfish and sharks and these were the strong troubled murderous thinkings of the masculine sea but though thus contrasting within the contrast was only in shades and shadows without those two seemed one it was only the sex as it were that distinguished them aloft like a royal czar and king the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom and at the girdling line of the horizon a soft and tremulous motionmost seen here at the equatordenoted the fond throbbing trust the loving alarms with which the poor bride gave her bosom away tied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with wrinkles haggardly firm and unyielding his eyes glowing like coals that still glow in the ashes of ruin untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girls forehead of heaven oh immortal infancy and innocency of the azure invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us sweet childhood of air and sky how oblivious were ye of old ahabs closecoiled woe but so have i seen little miriam and martha laughingeyed elves heedlessly gambol around their old sire sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burntout crater of his brain slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity but the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel for a moment the cankerous thing in his soul that glad happy air that winsome sky did at last stroke and caress him the stepmother world so long cruelforbiddingnow threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck and did seem to joyously sob over him as if over one that however wilful and erring she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into the sea nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop starbuck saw the old man saw him how he heavily leaned over the side and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around careful not to touch him or be noticed by him he yet drew near to him and stood there ahab turned starbuck sir oh starbuck it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky on such a dayvery much such a sweetness as thisi struck my first whalea boyharpooneer of eighteen fortyfortyforty years agoago forty years of continual whaling forty years of privation and peril and stormtime forty years on the pitiless sea for

captain study out the course and let us away see see the boys face from the window the boys hand on the hill but ahabs glance was averted like a blighted fruit tree he shook and cast his last cindered apple to the soil what is it what nameless inscrutable unearthly thing is it what cozening hidden lord and master and cruel remorseless emperor commands me that against all natural lovings and longings i so keep pushing and crowding and jamming myself on all the time recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper natural heart i durst not so much as dare is ahab ahab is it i god or who that lifts this arm but if the great sun move not of himself but is as an errandboy in heaven nor one single star can revolve but by some invisible power how then can this one small heart beat this one small brain think thoughts unless god does that beating does that thinking does that living and not i by heaven man we are turned round and round in this world like yonder windlass and fate

judge himself is dragged to the bar but it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky and the air smells now as if it blew from a faraway meadow they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the andes starbuck and the mowers are sleeping among the newmown hay sleeping aye toil we how we may we all sleep at last on the field sleep aye and rust amid greenness as last years scythes flung down and left in the halfcut swathsstarbuck but blanched to a corpses hue with despair the mate had stolen away ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side but started at two reflected fixed eyes in the water there fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail chapter the chasefirst day that night in the midwatch when the old manas his wont at intervalsstepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned and went to his pivothole he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ships dog will in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle he declared that a whale must be near soon that peculiar odor sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale was palpable to all the watch nor was any mariner surprised when after inspecting the compass and then the dogvane and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible ahab rapidly ordered the ships course to be slightly altered and the sail to be shortened the acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead smooth as oil and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it the polished metalliclike marks of some swift tiderip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream man the mastheads call all hands thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands what dye see cried ahab flattening his face to the sky nothing nothing sir was the sound hailing down in reply tgallant sailsstunsails alow and aloft and on both sides all sail being set he now cast loose the lifeline reserved for swaying him to the main royalmast head and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither when while but two thirds of the way aloft and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the maintopsail and topgallantsail he raised a gulllike cry in the air there she blowsthere she blows a hump like a snowhill it is moby dick fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three lookouts the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing ahab had now gained his final perch some feet above the other lookouts tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the topgallantmast so that the indians head was almost on a level with ahabs heel from this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air to the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans and did none of ye see it before cried ahab hailing the perched men all around him i saw him almost that same instant sir that captain ahab did and i cried out said tashtego not the same instant not the sameno the doubloon is mine fate reserved the doubloon for me _i_ only none of ye could have raised the white whale first there she blowsthere she blowsthere she blows there againthere again he cried in longdrawn lingering methodic tones attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whales visible jets hes going to sound in stunsails down topgallantsails stand by three boats mr starbuck remember stay on board and keep the ship helm there luff luff a point so steady man steady there go flukes no no only black water all ready the boats there stand by stand by lower me mr starbuck lower lowerquick quicker and he slid through the air to the deck he is heading straight to leeward sir cried stubb right away from us cannot have seen the ship yet be dumb man stand by the braces hard down the helmbrace up shiver hershiver herso well that boats boats soon all the boats but starbucks were dropped all the boatsails setall the paddles plying with rippling swiftness shooting to leeward and ahab heading the onset a pale deathglimmer lit up fedallahs sunken eyes a hideous motion gnawed his mouth like noiseless nautilus shells their light prows sped through the sea but only slowly they neared the foe as they neared him the ocean grew still more smooth seemed drawing a carpet over its waves seemed a noonmeadow so serenely it spread at length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing and continually set in a revolving ring of finest fleecy greenish foam he saw the vast involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond before it far out on the soft turkishrugged waters went the glistening white shadow from his broad milky forehead a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade and behind the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side but these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea alternate with their fitful flight and like to some flagstaff rising from the painted hull of an argosy the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whales back and at intervals one of the cloud of softtoed fowls hovering and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish silently perched and rocked on this pole the long tail feathers streaming like pennons a gentle joyousnessa mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invested the gliding whale not the white bull jupiter swimming away with ravished europa clinging to his graceful horns his lovely leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness rippling straight for the nuptial bower in crete not jove not that great majesty supreme did surpass the glorified white whale as he so divinely swam on each soft sidecoincident with the parted swell that but once leaving him then flowed so wide awayon each bright side the whale shed off enticings no wonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity had ventured to assail it but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes yet calm enticing calm oh whale thou glidest on to all who for the first time eye thee no matter how many in that same way thou mayst have bejuggled and destroyed before and thus through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea among waves whose handclappings were suspended by exceeding rapture moby dick moved on still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch like virginias natural bridge and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air the grand god revealed himself sounded and went out of sight hoveringly halting and dipping on the wing the white seafowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left with oars apeak and paddles down the sheets of their sails adrift the three boats now stilly floated awaiting moby dicks reappearance an hour said ahab standing rooted in his boats stern and he gazed beyond the whales place towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward it was only an instant for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle the breeze now freshened the sea began to swell the birdsthe birds cried tashtego in long indian file as when herons take wing the white birds were now all flying towards ahabs boat and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyous expectant cries their vision was keener than mans ahab could discover no sign in the sea but suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as it rose till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white glistening teeth floating up from the undiscoverable bottom it was moby dicks open mouth and scrolled jaw his vast shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea the glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an opendoored marble tomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition then calling upon fedallah to change places with him went forward to the bows and seizing perths harpoon commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern now by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis its bow by anticipation was made to face the whales head while yet under water but as if perceiving this stratagem moby dick with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplanted himself as it were in an instant shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat through and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for an instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air and one of the teeth caught in a rowlock the bluish pearlwhite of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahabs head and reached higher than that in this attitude the white whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse with unastonished eyes fedallah gazed and crossed his arms but the tigeryellow crew were tumbling over each others heads to gain the uttermost stern and now while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from his body being submerged beneath the boat he could not be darted at from the bows for the bows were almost inside of him as it were and while the other boats involuntarily paused as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand then it was that monomaniac ahab furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated frenzied with all this he seized the long bone with his naked hands and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe as now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the frail gunwales bent in collapsed and snapped as both jaws like an enormous shears sliding further aft bit the craft completely in twain and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between the two floating wrecks these floated aside the broken ends drooping the crew at the sternwreck clinging to the gunwales and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across at that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped ahab the first to perceive the whales intent by the crafty upraising of his head a movement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite but only slipping further into the whales mouth and tilting over sideways as it slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw spilled him out of it as he leaned to the push and so he fell flatfaced upon the sea ripplingly withdrawing from his prey moby dick now lay at a little distance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rosesome twenty or more feet out of the waterthe now rising swells with all their confluent waves dazzlingly broke against it vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air so in a gale the but half baffled channel billows only recoil from the base of the eddystone triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale it receives its designation pitchpoling from its being likened to that preliminary upanddown poise of the whalelance in the exercise called pitchpoling previously described by this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him but soon resuming his horizontal attitude moby dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before antiochuss elephants in the book of maccabees meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of the whales insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swimthough he could still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that helpless ahabs head was seen like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst from the boats fragmentary stern fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him the clinging crew at the other drifting end could not succor him more than enough was it for them to look to themselves for so revolvingly appalling was the white whales aspect and so planetarily swift the evercontracting circles he made that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them and though the other boats unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways ahab and all nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape with straining eyes then they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre had now become the old mans head meantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the ships mast heads and squaring her yards she had borne down upon the scene and was now so nigh that ahab in the water hailed hersail on thebut that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick and whelmed him for the time but struggling out of it again and chancing to rise on a towering crest he shoutedsail on the whaledrive him off the pequods prows were pointed and breaking up the charmed circle she effectually parted the white whale from his victim as he sullenly swam off the boats flew to the rescue dragged into stubbs boat with bloodshot blinded eyes the white brine caking in his wrinkles the long tension of ahabs bodily strength did crack and helplessly he yielded to his bodys doom for a time lying all crushed in the bottom of stubbs boat like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants far inland nameless wails came from him as desolate sounds from out ravines but this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it in an instants compass great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler mens whole lives and so such hearts though summary in each one suffering still if the gods decree it in their lifetime aggregate a whole age of woe wholly made up of instantaneous intensities for even in their pointless centres those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls the harpoon said ahab half way rising and draggingly leaning on one bended armis it safe aye sir for it was not darted this is it said stubb showing it lay it before meany missing men one two three four fivethere were five oars sir and here are five men thats goodhelp me man i wish to stand so so i see him there there going to leeward still what a leaping spouthands off from me the eternal sap runs up in ahabs bones again set the sail out oars the helm it is often the case that when a boat is stove its crew being picked up by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase is thus continued with what is called doublebanked oars it was thus now but the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale for he seemed to have treblebanked his every fin swimming with a velocity which plainly showed that if now under these circumstances pushed on the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged if not a hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long a period such an unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude the ship itself then as it sometimes happens offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase accordingly the boats now made for her and were soon swayed up to their cranesthe two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by herand then hoisting everything to her side and stacking her canvas high up and sideways outstretching it with stunsails like the doublejointed wings of an albatross the pequod bore down in the leeward wake of mobydick at the well known methodic intervals the whales glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mastheads and when he would be reported as just gone down ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck binnaclewatch in hand so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired his voice was heardwhose is the doubloon now dye see him and if the reply was no sir straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch in this way the day wore on ahab now aloft and motionless anon unrestingly pacing the planks as he was thus walking uttering no sound except to hail the men aloft or to bid them hoist a sail still higher or to spread one to a still greater breadththus to and fro pacing beneath his slouched hat at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been dropped upon the quarterdeck and lay there reversed broken bow to shattered stern at last he paused before it and as in an already overclouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across so over the old mans face there now stole some such added gloom as this stubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though to evince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place in his captains mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimedthe thistle the ass refused it pricked his mouth too keenly sir ha ha what soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck man man did i not know thee brave as fearless fire and as mechanical i could swear thou wert a poltroon groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck aye sir said starbuck drawing near tis a solemn sight an omen and an ill one omen omenthe dictionary if the gods think to speak outright to man they will honorably speak outright not shake their heads and give an old wives darkling hintbegone ye two are the opposite poles of one thing starbuck is stubb reversed and stubb is starbuck and ye two are all mankind and ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth nor gods nor men his neighbors cold coldi shiverhow now aloft there dye see him sing out for every spout though he spout ten times a second the day was nearly done only the hem of his golden robe was rustling soon it was almost dark but the lookout men still remained unset cant see the spout now sirtoo darkcried a voice from the air how heading when last seen as before sirstraight to leeward good he will travel slower now tis night down royals and topgallant stunsails mr starbuck we must not run over him before morning hes making a passage now and may heaveto a while helm there keep her full before the windaloft come downmr stubb send a fresh hand to the foremast head and see it manned till morningthen advancing towards the doubloon in the mainmastmen this gold is mine for i earned it but i shall let it abide here till the white whale is dead and then whosoever of ye first raises him upon the day he shall be killed this gold is that mans and if on that day i shall again raise him then ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye away nowthe deck is thine sir and so saying he placed himself half way within the scuttle and slouching his hat stood there till dawn except when at intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on chapter the chasesecond day at daybreak the three mastheads were punctually manned afresh dye see him cried ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread see nothing sir turn up all hands and make sail he travels faster than i thought forthe topgallant sailsaye they should have been kept on her all night but no mattertis but resting for the rush here be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale continued through day into night and through night into day is a thing by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery for such is the wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucket commanders that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried they will under certain given circumstances pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time while out of sight as well as his probable rate of progression during that period and in these cases somewhat as a pilot when about losing sight of a coast whose general trending he well knows and which he desires shortly to return to again but at some further point like as this pilot stands by his compass and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote unseen headland eventually to be visited so does the fisherman at his compass with the whale for after being chased and diligently marked through several hours of daylight then when night obscures the fish the creatures future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter as the pilots coast is to him so that to this hunters wondrous skill the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water a wake is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace that with watches in their hands men time his rate as doctors that of a babys pulse and lightly say of it the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an hour even so almost there are occasions when these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep according to the observed humor of his speed and say to themselves so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude but to render this acuteness at all successful in the end the wind and the sea must be the whalemans allies for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninetythree leagues and a quarter from his port inferable from these statements are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales the ship tore on leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannonball missent becomes a ploughshare and turns up the level field by salt and hemp cried stubb but this swift motion of the deck creeps up ones legs and tingles at the heart this ship and i are two brave fellowsha ha some one take me up and launch me spinewise on the seafor by liveoaks my spines a keel ha ha we go the gait that leaves no dust behind there she blowsshe blowsshe blowsright ahead was now the masthead cry aye aye cried stubb i knew itye cant escapeblow on and split your spout o whale the mad fiend himself is after ye blow your trumpblister your lungsahab will dam off your blood as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew the frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up like old wine worked anew whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of ahab but they were broken up and on all sides routed as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison the hand of fate had snatched all their souls and by the stirring perils of the previous day the rack of the past nights suspense the fixed unfearing blind reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark by all these things their hearts were bowled along the wind that made great bellies of their sails and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race they were one man not thirty for as the one ship that held them all though it was put together of all contrasting thingsoak and maple and pine wood iron and pitch and hempyet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull which shot on its way both balanced and directed by the long central keel even so all the individualities of the crew this mans valor that mans fear guilt and guiltiness all varieties were welded into oneness and were all directed to that fatal goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to the rigging lived the mastheads like the tops of tall palms were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs clinging to a spar with one hand some reached forth the other with impatient wavings others shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight sat far out on the rocking yards all the spars in full bearing of mortals ready and ripe for their fate ah how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them why sing ye not out for him if ye see him cried ahab when after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry no more had been heard sway me up men ye have been deceived not moby dick casts one odd jet that way and then disappears it was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some other thing for the whalespout as the event itself soon proved for hardly had ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck when he struck the keynote to an orchestra that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles the triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard asmuch nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile aheadmoby dick bodily burst into view for not by any calm and indolent spoutings not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did the white whale now reveal his vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more in those moments the torn enraged waves he shakes off seem his mane in some cases this breaching is his act of defiance there she breaches there she breaches was the cry as in his immeasurable bravadoes the white whale tossed himself salmonlike to heaven so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raised for the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale aye breach your last to the sun moby dick cried ahab thy hour and thy harpoon are at handdown down all of ye but one man at the fore the boatsstand by unmindful of the tedious ropeladders of the shrouds the men like shooting stars slid to the deck by the isolated backstays and halyards while ahab less dartingly but still rapidly was dropped from his perch lower away he cried so soon as he had reached his boata spare one rigged the afternoon previous mr starbuck the ship is thinekeep away from the boats but keep near them lower all as if to strike a quick terror into them by this time being the first assailant himself moby dick had turned and was now coming for the three crews ahabs boat was central and cheering his men he told them he would take the whale headandheadthat is pull straight up to his foreheada not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such a course excludes the coming onset from the whales sidelong vision but ere that close limit was gained and while yet all three boats were plain as the ships three masts to his eye the white whale churning himself into furious speed almost in an instant as it were rushing among the boats with open jaws and a lashing tail offered appalling battle on every side and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made but skilfully manœuvred incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field the boats for a while eluded him though at times but by a planks breadth while all the time ahabs unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds but at last in his untraceable evolutions the white whale so crossed and recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselves warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little as if to rally for a more tremendous charge seizing that opportunity ahab first paid out more line and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it againhoping that way to disencumber it of some snarlswhen loa sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks caught and twistedcorkscrewed in the mazes of the line loose harpoons and lances with all their bristling barbs and points came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahabs boat only one thing could be done seizing the boatknife he critically reached withinthroughand then withoutthe rays of steel dragged in the line beyond passed it inboard to the bowsman and then twice sundering the rope near the chocksdropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea and was all fast again that instant the white whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines by so doing irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and flask towards his flukes dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surfbeaten beach and then diving down into the sea disappeared in a boiling maelstrom in which for a space the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch while the two crews were yet circling in the waters reaching out after the revolving linetubs oars and other floating furniture while aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks and stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up and while the old mans linenow partingadmitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he couldin that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perilsahabs yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards heaven by invisible wiresas arrowlike shooting perpendicularly from the sea the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom and sent it turning over and over into the air till it fell againgunwale downwardsand ahab and his men struggled out from under it like seals from a seaside cave the first uprising momentum of the whalemodifying its direction as he struck the surfaceinvoluntarily launched him along it to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made and with his back to it he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin his tail swiftly drew back and came sideways smiting the sea but soon as if satisfied that his work for that time was done he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean and trailing after him the intertangled lines continued his leeward way at a travellers methodic pace as before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight again came bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up the floating mariners tubs oars and whatever else could be caught at and safely landed them on her decks some sprained shoulders wrists and ankles livid contusions wrenched harpoons and lances inextricable intricacies of rope shattered oars and planks all these were there but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one as with fedallah the day before so ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boats broken half which afforded a comparatively easy float nor did it so exhaust him as the previous days mishap but when he was helped to the deck all eyes were fastened upon him as instead of standing by himself he still halfhung upon the shoulder of starbuck who had thus far been the foremost to assist him his ivory leg had been snapped off leaving but one short sharp splinter aye aye starbuck tis sweet to lean sometimes be the leaner who he will and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he has the ferrule has not stood sir said the carpenter now coming up i put good work into that leg but no bones broken sir i hope said stubb with true concern aye and all splintered to pieces stubbdye see itbut even with a broken bone old ahab is untouched and i account no living bone of mine one jot more me than this dead one thats lost nor white whale nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being can any lead touch yonder floor any mast scrape yonder roofaloft there which way dead to leeward sir up helm then pile on the sail again ship keepers down the rest of the spare boats and rig themmr starbuck away and muster the boats crews let me first help thee towards the bulwarks sir oh oh oh how this splinter gores me now accursed fate that the unconquerable captain in

murderous fish till he swamps the last man shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea shall we be towed by him to the infernal world oh ohimpiety and blasphemy to hunt him more starbuck of late ive felt strangely moved to thee ever since that hour we both sawthou knowst what in one anothers eyes but in this matter of the whale be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this handa lipless unfeatured blank ahab is for ever ahab man this whole acts immutably decreed twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled fool i am the fates lieutenant i act under orders look thou underling that thou obeyest minestand round me men ye see an old man cut down to the stump leaning on a shivered lance propped up on a lonely foot tis ahabhis bodys part but ahabs souls a centipede that moves upon a hundred legs i feel strained half stranded as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale and i may look so but ere i break yell hear me crack and till ye hear _that_ know that ahabs hawser tows his purpose yet believe ye men in the things called omens then laugh aloud and cry encore for ere they drown drowning things will twice rise to the surface then rise again to sink for evermore so with moby dicktwo days hes floatedtomorrow will be the third aye men hell rise once morebut only to spout his last dye feel brave men brave as fearless fire cried stubb and as mechanical muttered ahab then as the men went forward he muttered on the things called omens and yesterday i talked the same to starbuck there concerning my broken boat oh how valiantly i seek to drive out of others hearts whats clinched so fast in minethe parseethe parseegone gone and he was to go beforebut still was to be seen again ere i could perishhows thattheres a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of judgeslike a hawks beak it pecks my brain _ill_ _ill_ solve it though when dusk descended the whale was still in sight to leeward so once more the sail was shortened and everything passed nearly as on the previous night only the sound of hammers and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow meantime of the broken keel of ahabs wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg while still as on the night before slouched ahab stood fixed within his scuttle his hid heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial sat due eastward for the earliest sun chapter the chasethird day the morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh and once more the solitary nightman at the foremasthead was relieved by crowds of the daylight lookouts who dotted every mast and almost every spar dye see him cried ahab but the whale was not yet in sight in his infallible wake though but follow that wake thats all helm there steady as thou goest and hast been going what a lovely day again were it a newmade world and made for a summerhouse to the angels and this morning the first of its throwing open to them a fairer day could not dawn upon that world heres food for thought had ahab time to think but ahab never thinks he only feels feels feels _thats_ tingling enough for mortal man to thinks audacity god only has that right and privilege thinking is or ought to be a coolness and a calmness and our poor hearts throb and our poor brains beat too much for that and yet ive sometimes thought my brain was very calmfrozen calm this old skull cracks so like a glass in which the contents turned to ice and shiver it and still this hair is growing now this moment growing and heat must breed it but no its like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy clefts of greenland ice or in vesuvius lava how the wild winds blow it they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to a vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells and wards of hospitals and ventilated them and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces out upon itits tainted were i the wind id blow no more on such a wicked miserable world id crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there and yet tis a noble and heroic thing the wind who ever conquered it in every fight it has the last and bitterest blow run tilting at it and you but run through it ha a coward wind that strikes stark naked men but will not stand to receive a single blow even ahab is a braver thinga nobler thing than _that_ would now the wind but had a body but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man all these things are bodiless but only bodiless as objects not as agents theres a most special a most cunning oh a most malicious difference and yet i say again and swear it now that theres something all glorious and gracious in the wind these warm trade winds at least that in the clear heavens blow straight on in strong and steadfast vigorous mildness and veer not from their mark however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack and mightiest mississippies of the land swift and swerve about uncertain where to go at last and by the eternal poles these same trades that so directly blow my good ship on these trades or something like themsomething so unchangeable and full as strong blow my keeled soul along to it aloft there what dye see nothing sir nothing and noon at hand the doubloon goes abegging see the sun aye aye it must be so ive oversailed him how got the start aye hes chasing _me_ now not i _him_thats bad i might have known it too fool the linesthe harpoons hes towing aye aye i have run him by last night about about come down all of ye but the regular look outs man the braces steering as she had done the wind had been somewhat on the pequods quarter so that now being pointed in the reverse direction the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake against the wind he now steers for the open jaw murmured starbuck to himself as he coiled the newhauled mainbrace upon the rail god keep us but already my bones feel damp within me and from the inside wet my flesh i misdoubt me that i disobey my god in obeying him stand by to sway me up cried ahab advancing to the hempen basket we should meet him soon aye aye sir and straightway starbuck did ahabs bidding and once more ahab swung on high a whole hour now passed goldbeaten out to ages time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense but at last some three points off the weather bow ahab descried the spout again and instantly from the three mastheads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it forehead to forehead i meet thee this third time moby dick on deck therebrace sharper up crowd her into the winds eye hes too far off to lower yet mr starbuck the sails shake stand over that helmsman with a topmaul so so he travels fast and i must down but let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea theres time for that an old old sight and yet somehow so young aye and not changed a wink since i first saw it a boy from the sandhills of nantucket the samethe samethe same to noah as to me theres a soft shower to leeward such lovely leewardings they must lead somewhereto something else than common land more palmy than the palms leeward the white whale goes that way look to windward then the better if the bitterer quarter but good bye good bye old masthead whats thisgreen aye tiny mosses in these warped cracks no such green weather stains on ahabs head theres the difference now between mans old age and matters but aye old mast we both grow old together sound in our hulls though are we not my ship aye minus a leg thats all by heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way i cant compare with it and ive known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers whats that he said he should still go before me my pilot and yet to be seen again but where will i have eyes at the bottom of the sea supposing i descend those endless stairs and all night ive been sailing from him wherever he did sink to aye aye like many more thou toldst direful truth as touching thyself o parsee but ahab there thy shot fell short goodbye mastheadkeep a good eye upon the whale the while im gone well talk tomorrow nay tonight when the white whale lies down there tied by head and tail he gave the word and still gazing round him was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck in due time the boats were lowered but as standing in his shallops stern ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent he waved to the matewho held one of the tackleropes on deckand bade him pause starbuck sir for the third time my souls ship starts upon this voyage starbuck aye sir thou wilt have it so some ships sail from their ports and ever afterwards are missing starbuck truth sir saddest truth some men die at ebb tide some at low water some at the full of the floodand i feel now like a billow thats all one crested comb starbuck i am oldshake hands with me man their hands met their eyes fastened starbucks tears the glue oh my captain my captainnoble heartgo notgo notsee its a brave man that weeps how great the agony of the persuasion then lower awaycried ahab tossing the mates arm from him stand by the crew in an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern the sharks the sharks cried a voice from the low cabinwindow there o master my master come back but ahab heard nothing for his own voice was highlifted then and the boat leaped on yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when numbers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars every time they dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whaleboats in those swarming seas the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east but these were the first sharks that had been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first descried and whether it was that ahabs crew were all such tigeryellow barbarians and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharksa matter sometimes well known to affect themhowever it was they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others heart of wrought steel murmured starbuck gazing over the side and following with his eyes the receding boatcanst thou yet ring boldly to that sightlowering thy keel among ravening sharks and followed by them openmouthed to the chase and this the critical third dayfor when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit be sure the first is the morning the second the noon and the third the evening and the end of that thingbe that end what it may oh my god what is this that shoots through me and leaves me so deadly calm yet expectantfixed at the top of a shudder future things swim before me as in empty outlines and skeletons all the past is somehow grown dim mary girl thou fadest in pale glories behind me boy i seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue strangest problems of life seem clearing but clouds sweep betweenis my journeys end coming my legs feel faint like his who has footed it all day feel thy heartbeats it yet stir thyself starbuckstave it offmove move speak aloudmasthead there see ye my boys hand on the hillcrazedaloft therekeep thy keenest eye upon the boatsmark well the whaleho againdrive off that hawk see he peckshe tears the vanepointing to the red flag flying at the maintruckha he soars away with itwheres the old man now seest thou that sight oh ahabshudder shudder the boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mastheadsa downward pointed arm ahab knew that the whale had sounded but intending to be near him at the next rising he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence as the headbeat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow drive drive in your nails oh ye waves to their uttermost heads drive them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coffin and no hearse can be mineand hemp only can kill me ha ha suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles then quickly upheaved as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice swiftly rising to the surface a low rumbling sound was heard a subterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggled with trailing ropes and harpoons and lances a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air and then fell swamping back into the deep crushed thirty feet upwards the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale give way cried ahab to the oarsmen and the boats darted forward to the attack but maddened by yesterdays fresh irons that corroded in him moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together as head on he came churning his tail among the boats and once more flailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows but leaving ahabs almost without a scar while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks and as the whale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up lashed round and round to the fishs back pinioned in the turns upon turns in which during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him the half torn body of the parsee was seen his sable raiment frayed to shreds his distended eyes turned full upon old ahab the harpoon dropped from his hand befooled befooleddrawing in a long lean breathaye parsee i see thee againaye and thou goest before and this _this_ then is the hearse that thou didst promise but i hold thee to the last letter of thy word where is the second hearse away mates to the ship those boats are useless now repair them if ye can in time and return to me if not ahab is enough to diedown men the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat i stand in that thing i harpoon ye are not other men but my arms and my legs and so obey mewheres the whale gone down again but he looked too nigh the boat for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage moby dick was now again steadily swimming forward and had almost passed the shipwhich thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him though for the present her headway had been stopped he seemed swimming with his utmost velocity and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea oh ahab cried starbuck not too late is it even now the third day to desist see moby dick seeks thee not it is thou thou that madly seekest him setting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward by both oars and canvas and at last when ahab was sliding by the vessel so near as plainly to distinguish starbucks face as he leaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the vessel about and follow him not too swiftly at a judicious interval glancing upwards he saw tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mounting to the three mastheads while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side and were busily at work in repairing them one after the other through the portholes as he sped he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances as he saw all this as he heard the hammers in the broken boats far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart but he rallied and now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the mainmasthead he shouted to tashtego who had just gained that perch to descend again for another flag and a hammer and nails and so nail it to the mast whether fagged by the three days running chase and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever was true the white whales way now began to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more though indeed the whales last start had not been so long a one as before and still as ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat and so continually bit at the plying oars that the blades became jagged and crunched and left small splinters in the sea at almost every dip heed them not those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars pull on tis the better rest the sharks jaw than the yielding water but at every bite sir the thin blades grow smaller and smaller they will last long enough pull onbut who can tellhe mutteredwhether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on ahabbut pull on aye all alive nowwe near him the helm take the helm let me passand so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat at length as the craft was cast to one side and ran ranging along with the white whales flank he seemed strangely oblivious of its advanceas the whale sometimes willand ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist which thrown off from the whales spout curled round his great monadnock hump he was even thus close to him when with body arched back and both arms lengthwise highlifted to the poise he darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale as both steel and curse sank to the socket as if sucked into a morass moby dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow and without staving a hole in it so suddenly canted the boat over that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea as it was three of the oarsmenwho foreknew not the precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for its effectsthese were flung out but so fell that in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again and rising to its level on a combing wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again the third man helplessly dropping astern but still afloat and swimming almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness the white whale darted through the weltering sea but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air what breaks in me some sinew crackstis whole again oars oars burst in upon him hearing the tremendous rush of the seacrashing boat the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay but in that evolution catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions bethinking itit may bea larger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing prow smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam ahab staggered his hand smote his forehead i grow blind hands stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way ist night the whale the ship cried the cringing oarsmen oars oars slope downwards to thy depths o sea that ere it be for ever too late ahab may slide this last last time upon his mark i see the ship the ship dash on my men will ye not save my ship but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledgehammering seas the before whalesmitten bowends of two planks burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves its halfwading splashing crew trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water meantime for that one beholding instant tashtegos masthead hammer remained suspended in his hand and the red flag halfwrapping him as with a plaid then streamed itself straight out from him as his own forwardflowing heart while starbuck and stubb standing upon the bowsprit beneath caught sight of the downcoming monster just as soon as he the whale the whale up helm up helm oh all ye sweet powers of air now hug me close let not starbuck die if die he must in a womans fainting fit up helm i sayye fools the jaw the jaw is this the end of all my bursting prayers all my lifelong fidelities oh ahab ahab lo thy work steady helmsman steady nay nay up helm again he turns to meet us oh his unappeasable brow drives on towards one whose duty tells him he cannot depart my god stand by me now stand not by me but stand under me whoever you are that will now help stubb for stubb too sticks here i grin at thee thou grinning whale who ever helped stubb or kept stubb awake but stubbs own unwinking eye and now poor stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft would it were stuffed with brushwood i grin at thee thou grinning whale look ye sun moon and stars i call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost for all that i would yet ring glasses with ye would ye but hand the cup oh oh oh oh thou grinning whale but therell be plenty of gulping soon why fly ye not o ahab for me off shoes and jacket to it let stubb die in his drawers a most mouldy and over salted death thoughcherries cherries cherries oh flask for one red cherry ere we die cherries i only wish that we were where they grow oh stubb i hope my poor mothers drawn my partpay ere this if not few coppers will now come to her for the voyage is up from the ships bows nearly all the seamen now hung inactive hammers bits of plank lances and harpoons mechanically retained in their hands just as they had darted from their various employments all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed retribution swift vengeance eternal malice were in his whole aspect and spite of all that mortal man could do the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ships starboard bow till men and timbers reeled some fell flat upon their faces like dislodged trucks the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bulllike necks through the breach they heard the waters pour as mountain torrents down a flume the ship the hearsethe second hearse cried ahab from the boat its wood could only be american diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along its keel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again far off the other bow but within a few yards of ahabs boat where for a time he lay quiescent i turn my body from the sun what ho tashtego let me hear thy hammer oh ye three unsurrendered spires of mine thou uncracked keel and only godbullied hull thou firm deck and haughty helm and polepointed prowdeathglorious ship must ye then perish and without me am i cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains oh lonely death on lonely life oh now i feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief ho ho from all your furthest bounds pour ye now in ye bold billows of my whole foregone life and top this one piled comber of my death towards thee i roll thou alldestroying but unconquering whale to the last i grapple with thee from hells heart i stab at thee for hates sake i spit my last breath at thee sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool and since neither can be mine let me then tow to pieces while still chasing thee though tied to thee thou damned whale _thus_ i give up the spear the harpoon was darted the stricken whale flew forward with igniting velocity the line ran through the groovesran foul ahab stooped to clear it he did clear it but the flying turn caught him round the neck and voicelessly as turkish mutes bowstring their victim he was shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he was gone next instant the heavy eyesplice in the ropes final end flew out of the starkempty tub knocked down an oarsman and smiting the sea disappeared in its depths for an instant the tranced boats crew stood still then turned the ship great god where is the ship soon they through dim bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom as in the gaseous fata morgana only the uppermost masts out of water while fixed by infatuation or fidelity or fate to their once lofty perches the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea and now concentric circles seized the lone boat itself and all its crew and each floating oar and every lancepole and spinning animate and inanimate all round and round in one vortex carried the smallest chip of the pequod out of sight but as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the indian at the mainmast leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible together with long streaming yards of the flag which calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over the destroying billows they almost touchedat that instant a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar a skyhawk that tauntingly had followed the maintruck downwards from its natural home among the stars pecking at the flag and incommoding tashtego there this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill the submerged savage beneath in his deathgasp kept his hammer frozen there and so the bird of heaven with archangelic shrieks and his imperial beak thrust upwards and his whole captive form folded in the flag of ahab went down with his ship which like satan would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her and helmeted herself with it now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides then all collapsed and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago epilogue and i only am escaped alone to tell thee job the dramas done why then here does any one step forthbecause one did survive the wreck it so chanced that after the parsees disappearance i was he whom the fates ordained to take the place of ahabs bowsman when that bowsman assumed the vacant post the same who when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat was dropped astern so floating on the margin of the ensuing scene and in full sight of it when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me i was then but slowly drawn towards the closing vortex when i reached it it had subsided to a creamy pool round and round then and ever contracting towards the buttonlike black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle like another ixion i did revolve till gaining that vital centre the black bubble upward burst and now liberated by reason of its cunning spring and owing to its great buoyancy rising with great force the coffin lifebuoy shot lengthwise from the sea fell over and floated by my side buoyed up by that coffin for almost one whole day and night i floated on a soft and dirgelike main the unharming sharks they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths the savage seahawks sailed with sheathed beaks on the second day a sail drew near nearer and picked me up at last

start of the project gutenberg ebook jack pumpkinhead of oz jack pumpkinhead of oz by ruth plumly thompson founded on and continuing the famous oz stories _by_ l frank baum royal historian of oz _illustrated by_ john r neill the reilly lee co chicago new york copyright _by_ the reilly lee co all rights reserved _this book is affectionately dedicated to my aunt joe_ _ruth plumly thompson_ dear boys and girls did you ever hear of the land of the barons of a red jinn or the city of scares well neither did i neither did jack pumpkinhead but there they were all the time and trouble brewing for everybody and speaking of jack pumpkinhead ive always suspected he was brighter than he appeared to be and had more in his head than pumpkin seeds and now im convinced of it why even when jack lost his head he kept on thinking and a chap who can serve his country after he is beheaded and use his head after he has been officially executed deserves a place with the greatest celebrities of the day so no wonder this book is about jack if it had not been for him ozma would be polishing the palace piano and dorothy and betsy washing the dinner dishes like as not and all of the other famous folk swinging mops brooms and dusters slaves of mogodore the mighty who descended from the land of the barons to capture the emerald city even now the mere mention of mogodore makes ozma shudder and the cowardly lion shake and right here i must put in a good word for peter the little boy from philadelphia peter wishing himself to oz dropped into the middle of the excitement was captured and imprisoned threatened and enchanted during his efforts to save the country from the wicked baron but seeing his old friends again and meeting the iffin made up for all the discomfort and danger and as i am anxious for you to meet this new merry monster ill stop writing so you can begin the story a whole year of happiness and fun ruth plumly thompson s farragut terrace west philadelphia penn may

beat heavily on the roof swirled down the side walks and made tumbling torrents of the gutters turning from the window in disgust peter dropped his baseball mitt on the library sofa and started glumly toward the stair no practice today doggone it why couldnt it rain on mondays and be clear on saturdays for a change how was he to have the team in trim for the big match if this sort of thing kept up kicking crossly at each step peter progressed toward the attic not to waste the day he resolved to have a look at his fishing tackle the thought of the fishing trip he was soon to take with his grandfather cheered him considerably and by the time he had switched on the attic light and dragged out the old chest where he kept his treasures he was whistling softly to himself on top of the chest lay two coarse sacks they were neatly folded in half and as peter lifted them off he gave an amused little chuckle i wonder whats happened in oz lately mused peter sitting down in front of the chest with the sacks on his lap i wonder whether ozma knows what i did with the pirates gold pieces and whether the gnome king has got into any more mischief and thinking of that enchanting and enchanted kingdom peter forgot all about his fishing tackle now many of you may have read or heard of the marvelous land of oz but peter had really been there had met the scarecrow and the wonderful wizard had kept the gnome king from conquering the emerald city and even discovered a pirate ship full of treasure the pirate who owned the ship had once been a real pirate so when ozma the little girl ruler of oz transported peter and the treasure back to philadelphia two of the bags of gold had been real gold and these bags had come with him these very sacks that peter held across his knees had once bulged with gold pieces and those of peters friends and relations who had sniffed at the story of his amazing journey to oz never had been able to explain them away peters grandfather with whom the little boy lived had not tried to explain them for peters grandfather was old enough to believe almost anything so he and peter had spent one bag of gold very gaily on a trip to the coast on motorcycles for peter and his best friends on a club house for the team on canoes and some more things too the other bag they had changed into united states dollars and put into the bank so that peter might go to college and other important places when he was grown and now with the rain drumming steadily on the roof peter fell to dreaming again of oz of its curious kings and castles its wizards and witches and magic transformations could it have been two years ago that he and the gnome king escaped from runaway island i wish sighed peter giving the top sack a little shake i wish i could go back to oz sometime hello whats this in the corner of the top sack he felt something hard and round and thrusting in his hand drew out a thin shiny piece of gold why heres one we didnt find chuckled peter holding it up to the light its not so large as the others i believe ill keep it for a lucky piece resting his head against a small trunk peter sank back and was soon lost in pleasant reveries geewhiz he breathed at last flipping the pirates coin into the air it certainly would be great to go to oz again i wish i were there right now as the gold piece dropped into peters palm peter himself dropped out of sight at least he was no longer in the attic or in philadelphia either for that matter he was to be perfectly truthful standing before a small yellow cottage in the middle of a pumpkin field and the whole trip reflected peter staring around a bit wildly had taken no longer than one puff and swallow a drop such as this was enough to make a body puff and swallow several times so he did then having regained a little of his composure he looked uncertainly at the yellow house it was shaped like an enormous hollowed out pumpkin but had several windows and a front door so peter walked boldly up the steps and knocked twice he could hear footsteps running about inside and presently a head was thrust out the second story window whos there asked the owner of the house staring down curiously illustration _whos there asked the owner of the house staring out curiously_ its me erer its i peter remembering his grammar corrected himself quickly at this the owner of the house in order to have a better look at his visitor leaned so far out the window that peter gave a sharp cry oh look out he called warningly for the mans head seemed ready to fall off was falling off in fact i am looking out it called cheerfully as it turned over and over in the air thats just the trouble catch my head will you and next minute peter found himself clasping a large pumpkin head in both arms did you say your name was cy asked the head staring up inquiringly well carry me indoors cy youll find my body around somewheres this must be oz choked peter with an excited little gasp and kicking open the door he hurried into the cottage a tall awkward body sprawled on the floor and there was certainly something familiar about the hollow eyes staring so pleasantly into his own my body has fallen down the stairs observed the pumpkin head calmly it should have waited for me for nobody should be without a head peter agreed heartily with this last statement and setting the head on the table he pulled the awkward figure to its feet and then standing on a chair pressed the head carefully on the wooden peg that served for a neck why its jack pumpkinhead he cried delightedly didnt i meet you in ozmas palace two years ago dont you remember me jack looked doubtfully down at the little boy im afraid that i dont he answered seriously you see i have had several new heads since then and am not very good at remembering never mind i remember you peter smiled kindly at the awkward fellow and squeezing his wooden fingers went on my name is peter and i thought you said your name was cy objected jack in a puzzled voice oh no i didnt explained peter a little vexed at the pumpkin heads stupidity i said its i at the door cy at the door and peter in the house how dreadfully confusing mumbled jack putting one hand to his head to see if it was on straight have you a different name for every place you go oh call me peter exclaimed the little boy impatiently and if youll just tell me the way to the emerald city ill not bother you any more im anxious to see ozma and dorothy again are you a friend of ozmas interrupted jack in high excitement well ill do anything for a friend of ozmas ozma is my father running to the door jack clattered down the steps beckoning for peter to follow him father cried peter with a little burst of laughter and then realizing one could not expect too much sense from a pumpkin head he hurried out of the cottage the pirates sack still hung over his arm and tossing it gaily over one shoulder peter stepped quickly after jack and clapped him on his shoulder by the way how did you reach oz picking his way carefully between the rows of pumpkins jack paused and turned his head with both hands so he could look back at peter briefly peter told him of finding the last coin in the pirates sack how he had wished to be in oz and suddenly found himself standing before the yellow cottage it must have been a magic coin muttered jack pumpkinhead starting on again i tell you he gave an excited skip that gold coin was a piece of change you wished to come to oz for a change and here you are yes agreed peter slowly but where is the gold piece you cant have the change and the gold piece too reproved jack wagging his wooden finger and youd rather have the change now wouldnt you peter nodded and glanced sharply at jack his head seemed to be working better jack returned peters look with a long steady stare do you know he said stepping deliberately over a high fence onto a gold paved highway you remind me more and more of my dear father your dear father exploded peter sitting down on the top rail of the fence i thought a while ago you told me that princess ozma was your father she is answered jack marching calmly along the highway but ozmas a girl shouted peter indignantly catching up with jack how could a girl be your father and how could i remind you of ozma ozma was not always a girl explained jack mysteriously once ozma was a boy like you i see you have never heard my strange story finished jack in a hurt voicelooking reproachfully down at peter though peter had met jack pumpkinhead at ozmas palace he had to admit that he knew nothing of his interesting history so as they sauntered slowly along the highway jack told how ozma as a baby had been stolen by mombi the witch and transformed into a boy named tip for nearly nine years tip had lived in mombis hut entirely ignorant of the fact that he was the real ruler of oz it was to scare mombi that tip had first manufactured the pumpkinhead man jacks wooden arms and legs had been skillfully carved from strong saplings his body made of a tough piece of bark was pinned together with wooden pegs a larger peg served jack for a neck and a carved pumpkin made his head with some old clothes he found in mombis attic tip had dressed the queer figure and stood him in the bend of the road to scare the old witch on her return from a visit to the crooked wizards well was mombi scared inquired peter looking admiringly at jacks jointed wrists and ankles and thinking what a smart boy ozma must have been at first admitted jack slowly at first then wishing to try out some of the magic she had traded with the wizard she sprinkled me with the powder of life and immediately i came to life and have been alive ever since he finished modestly but what happened to tip begged peter for he felt that the most exciting part of the story was to come well continued jack with a solemn shake of his head as mombi threatened to turn tip to a marble statue we both ran away that night taking the powder of life with us next morning tip found a sawhorse standing in a wood and sprinkling it with some of the powder brought it to life as mombi had done me on this strange steed we reached the emerald city and helped the scarecrow who was then emperor escape from jinjurs army of girls who had captured the capitol after many curious adventures we reached the palace of glinda the good sorceress of the south we begged her to help us restore the scarecrow to his throne but glinda by referring to her magic records discovered that ozma was the rightful ruler of the kingdom returning to the emerald city glinda forced mombi to disenchant tip tip became ozma and ozma as you well know has been our gracious little sovereign ever since what a shame breathed peter kicking at a stone i should think shed much rather have stayed a boy so should i agreed jack but as i am only a pumpkin head my opinion is probably of no value i certainly have no reason to complain he went on cheerfully ozma gave me the fine cottage which you saw this morning and i spend all my time growing new heads before one pumpkin spoils i quickly carve myself another and have had dozens of heads in my day which makes me a personage even in oz this head im now wearing will last quite a long time for its still a bit green well it looks all right said peter smiling up at jack do you think so jacks carved grin seemed to grow even broader at peters polite remark if it were not for my joints id be as good as anyone he confided tapping his chest proudly but walking wears out my joints so i never walk far at a time is it far to the emerald city shading his eyes peter blinked down the gay gold highway and then turned rather anxiously to his cheerful companion he certainly did not want good natured jack to wear out any joints on his account no distance at all retorted jack with a stiff wave ahead around that bend the houses and trees will be green for we will be on the outskirts of the capitol and from there it is but a step to the palace at jacks word peter gave a satisfied little sigh it was all coming backhis geozify oz how well he remembered that great oblong kingdom divided into four smaller kingdoms with the emerald city in the exact center in the eastern winkie country of oz the houses fences fruit and flowers were all yellow in the southern quadling country they were red in the northlands of the gillikens they were purple and in the western kingdom of the munchkins they were blue from the daffodils in all the fields and the round yellow farm houses peter knew they were in the winkie country but at the next turning they should find the green trees and parks surrounding the loveliest city in oz thinking of this enchanting spot its gay and jolly inhabitants and the welcome he was sure to find in the palace peter quickened his steps reaching the bend of the road far ahead of jack but instead of flowering gardens and green parkways the highway ended abruptly in a high red brick wall there was a small black door in the wall in red letters on this door were two wordsenter here peter was staring uncertainly at these directions when jack caught up with him well cy what now he demanded merrily see i remembered you were cy at the door ha ha ho ho ho oh do try to be sensible begged peter in an annoyed voice cant you see that this wall is red we must be in the quadling country jack youve come the wrong way and were lost now the question is whether to go back the way we came or go through this door and try to find a short cut to the emerald city i was afraid this head was not quite ripe enough mumbled jack in a worried voice perhaps if we go through this door and turn straight north well find the emerald city just as quickly as if we turn back perhaps echoed peter doubtfully then as he was beginning to feel an overpowering curiosity as to what might be on the other side of the wall he opened the black door and stepped through chapter the chimney villains now im santy claus mumbled jack feeling around for his head both he and peter had stepped off into space and tumbled together down a long dark passageway weve fallen down a chimney continued jack finding his head and settling it firmly on his shoulders i must say this is a great way to enter a city it is a grate said peter with a little groan for he was sitting astride a pair of iron fire dogs but how do you know its a city fortunately there was no fire burning in the grate and picking up the pirates sack peter stepped out into a large red square jack had to bend almost double to get out at all and as he straightened up a sign hanging on the outside of the chimney caught his attention please shut the grate after you directed the sign being an obliging fellow jack pulled the handle at the right and a sliding black screen completely closed off the opening dusting the soot from his frayed coat jack joined peter nothing but chimneys marvelled the little boy with a low whistle ive often seen houses without chimneys but never chimneys without houses the square was simply bristling with chimneys all red and of every shape size and description they seemed to sprout like queer flowers from the red flags that paved the square chimneys chimneys chimneys so close together there was scarcely space to walk who could possibly live here said peter with a scornful sniff whee wheeee we do a hundred high voices answered his question they seemed to issue from the chimneys themselves and as jack and peter peered anxiously upward strange smoky figures began to spiral out of the chimney tops and float in a dark mass over their heads they looked like evil genii or goblins who had long been imprisoned in magic bottles their shapes and faces changed constantly and as a whole horde of them dropped downward peter stepped closer to jack theyre only smoke he explained reassuringly yes dear peter quavered jack but smoke is most injurious to pumpkins oh my head my poor poor head peter had no time to sympathize with jack for at that moment a crowd of smokies surrounded them their eyes were spitered sparks and snatching at peter and jack with their long shadowy arms they began to hiss and puff threateningly can you curl demanded one snapping his eyes close to peter can you curl and do a double spiral can you make soot and smoulder no no no coughed peter snatching out his handkerchief and waving it wildly about his head go away go away youre making me all black ha ha ha shrieked a great smoky giant thats the color you should be this is chimneyville but wait till you see our soot sooty down below come to our sooty and see how black and beautiful you will become we wont cried jack pumpkinhead defiantly we wont come or become if this is chimneyville then you are chimneyvillains go away you black monsters we refuse to visit your old sooty go away go away youre smoking my beautiful head trying to cover his head with his arms jack backed against a chimney but his words only seemed to infuriate the smokies swelling with rage they surged forward smoke em up smoke em out throw em down the chimneys they sputtered now then boys all together while peter and jack struck out left and right the grim gray specters tried to lift them into the air but there was no strength in their vapory arms and with little shrieks and hisses they pressed closer and closer run panted peter who was almost suffocated the smoke did not affect jack and taking peters hand he tried to pull the little boy along but the air was now so thick with their pursuers they could hardly see at all and bumped and crashed into chimneys at every turn the last bump flung them headlong and for a moment they lay perfectly still while the chimneyvillains swept screaming overhead it was dark as midnight for the smokies had all run together into a great suffocating cloud even the tiny sparks that were their eyes had gone out and in utter and awful darkness peter finally stumbled to his feet coughing and sputtering and with tears pouring down both cheeks he felt in his pocket for another handkerchief and as he did his fingers closed over a small candle end immediately a bright idea struck peter and with a gasp he felt around for jacks head pulling the stout stem in the top he lifted out the piece jack had cut when he hollowed out the pumpkin striking a match he lit the candle end spilled in a few drops of candle grease and set the candle erect then replacing the top of jacks head he jerked him to his feet what have you done faltered the pumpkinhead in a faint voice my head feels very light dear peter but i seem to see much better so do i choked the little boy muffling his nose in his coat sleeve we can both see better come on youre lit up and my jack o lantern now the bobbing light in the pumpkins head seemed to puzzle their enemies but peter guided by the cheery glow pushed bravely through the clouds and crowds of them the smoke still stung his eyes and throat but he kept dodging chimney after chimney and finally pausing to rest against an especially broad one discovered a slide like the one they had come thru in the first place jerking it open peter pulled jack into the grate and closed the slide there was another slide at the back of the chimney place and as the smokies poured against the first slide peter opened the second and stepped out into a quiet little wood a great way in and a great way out observed jack following peter quickly and slamming the slide after him and a great way from everywhere puffed peter dropping down on the nearest tree stump and staring resentfully up at the red wall it looked the same from this side as from the other not a chimney showed nor one puff of smoke to warn luckless travellers of the disagreeable citizens of soot city it was so great a relief to breathe pure air again and find himself in real daylight that peter sat for several minutes drinking in the fresh forest breezes and freeing his lungs from the bitter smoke then standing up on the stump he called jack and blew out the candle in his pumpkin head you certainly saved my life that time said peter feelingly if you had not lighted me out of there id have been a smoked herring by this time how do you feel yourself dear jack a little light headed confessed jack earnestly but on the whole i rather liked it it seems to me i felt brighter you mean you could think better asked peter staring hard at jack and trying not to laugh yes jack nodded gravely so please light me up again dear peter it might not be good for you said the little boy doubtfully it might make you light headed and giddy besides pumpkins are only lit at night or in the dark and its quite light out here oh are they jack looked terribly disappointed well any time you need a lantern just light me up shall we go on to the emerald city now well we might try to answered peter looking around with lively interest can you walk a little farther do your joints feel all right although jack was much taller than he peter felt somehow responsible for the flimsy fellow it rather flattered him to have jack so obedient to his wishes and so dependent upon his advice after examining his joints carefully jack decided he might go a bit further so peter washed his face in a little stream and at the same time removed the soot from jacks and they prepared to continue their journey to the capitol taking his direction from the sun peter started north through the little wood from the cardinals and robins from the red beech and holly trees he knew he must still be in the quadling country and when he saw a small red cottage in a clearing just ahead he was sure of it goody shop announced a sign swinging from the crooked roof hurrah shouted peter breaking into a run maybe i can buy something to eat here it must be nearly lunch time and im starved oh do be careful warned jack holding on to his head with both hands as he dashed hurriedly after peter they may not be the kind of goodies you expect the shop was dim and dark and behind the red counter sat a prim little old lady in a ruffled gown good morning puffed peter with a polite bow our good morning is all gone said the old lady rising stiffly from her tall stool but we have a very good afternoon would you care for that she squinted anxiously at peter and will you take it with you or have it sent have it sent advised jack in a hollow voice for he did not relish the old ladys expression i wanted to buy something good explained peter hastily well why didnt you say so in the beginning snapped the shop keeper testily one minute its good morning and now its goodbye what kind of a goodbye do you want long short fond or sorrowful at this strange question jack turned his head with both hands and simply stared at the old lady and peter himself began to feel terribly confused what kind of goods do you sell here he demanded anxiously all the goods answered the old lady proudly but dry goods mostly waving toward the shelves she folded her arms and looked suspiciously at her two customers while jack and peter curiously surveyed her wares good news good advice good intentions good days good night good excuses good riddance cried peter reading out the labels on the bottles and boxes how odd good ideas good tempers good notions good times come come muttered the old lady tapping her foot impatiently on the floor make up your minds you may each choose one she decided finally as neither peter nor jack seemed able to decide why dont you take a good excuse she suggested turning to peter boys are always needing good excuses and a fresh batch has just come ingood ones too i think ill take some good advice announced jack in a timid voice im not very bright and it might be useful but havent you anything good to eat sighed peter a good lunch or dinner even a breakfast would do with an impatient flounce the old lady reached up on a top shelf and handed peter a small red box then giving jack a red envelope she shooed them out of her goody shop i wish id taken some good excuses murmured peter as they walked slowly down the crooked path this box is too small to hold a good meal of any kind what does it say asked jack inquisitively a good breakfast answered peter reading the red label well even if its only a biscuit or just one sausage ill eat it eagerly peter raised the lid why its bird seed he exclaimed angrily flinging the box with all his force into a redberry bush what a cheat ive a good notion to go right back and tell her what i think of her but she didnt charge you anything observed jack mildly and youll have to admit it is a good breakfast a good breakfast roared peter glaring indignantly at his loosejointed companion well it is a good breakfast finished jack pumpkinhead apologetically for a bird peter looked closely at jack to see whether he was poking fun at him but quite soberly jack was opening his good advice what does yours say crowding closer peter read the words on the thin slip of paper and then began to hop up and down with glee keep your mouth shut advised the red paper briefly call that good advice sputtered jack pumpkinhead tearing the paper into tiny pieces how can i keep my mouth shut when its carved open of all the silly nonsense but youll have to admit that keeping your mouth shut is good advice teased peter completely restored to good humor by this joke on jack then why dont you take it asked jack stalking stiffly ahead take it and welcome smothering another chuckle peter hurried after jack reflecting to himself that this pumpkinhead man was not nearly so foolish as he appeared to be chapter what the green tree said wont dorothy and ozma be surprised when we turn up at the palace taking a running jump peter cleared a tree and then hurried back to help jack pumpkinhead across ill be surprised myself said jack stepping solemnly over the log here we are at the end of this wood and no signs of the emerald city at all do you see anything green peter peter shook his head for as far as the eye could reach there was nothing but rocks and sand tinged with the rusty red of the quadling country i see red nothing but red sighed the little boy in a depressed voice wait theres one green tree thougha fir tree why its running straight for us hey look what youre doing get off my foot giving the tree a quick shove peter sprang backward but the tree leaned a little further over and resting its lower branches on his shoulders began to sob heavily im very tired it panted in a weak whisper very tired it spoke through a hollow in the center of its trunk and its knot eyes stared mournfully into peters own well you cant lean on me exclaimed peter crossly giving it another push im tired too why i never heard of such a thing he continued in an indignant voice what are you doing where are you going why dont you act like a regular tree wrenching the branches from his shoulders peter stepped off and eyed it angrily you dont belong in this country anyway put in jack accusingly youre green and you know it hush muttered the tree putting a lower branch over its mouth im a christmas tree looking for last years ornaments there were a few gay colored balls still clinging to the top and as peter too astonished to make any reply continued to stare the tree drew closer are you a christmas present it asked hoarsely are you an ornament oh go away laughed the little boy giving it another shove do i look like a christmas present and cant you see were not ornaments with a little chuckle he waved at his companion i could use his head murmured the tree squinting through its branches at jack its not at all pretty but it would light up and look real merry here you with a sudden pounce the tree made for jack give me your pumpkin head and no nonsense either as jack and peter both jumped back together a simply astonishing thing happened from the end of each branch on the christmas tree a hand shot out and with each hand extended it dashed after them see i trim myself it yelled snapping its fingers hilariously come here you provoking boy ill wager you have plenty of stuff in your pockets i could use for presents have you a watch or a gold pen knife at each question it made greedy snatches at peter let me pick your pockets give me your head you great jumpingjack ten of its hands just grazed jacks coattails at first peter had been rather amused by the christmas tree but now thoroughly alarmed he clutched jacks hand and ran so fast that jack had all he could do to hold on to his head and keep from stumbling as they continued to elude it the determined little tree grew very angry hopping up and down its roots it seized the ornaments from its top branches and hurled them one after another at the fleeing pair three balls and a candy cane crashed to bits on peters head and as he dodged in between two big boulders a silver dinner bell tied with red ribbon hit him sharply between the eyes geewhiz spluttered the little boy clapping his hand to his forehead this is no fun pulling jack after him he squeezed into a narrow crevice between the rocks but before he did jack leaned down picked up the bell and slipped it into his pocket as the christmas tree attempted to push its way between the rocks peter and jack pressed against a rough wall at the back now it happened that in this wall there was a swinging rock door and as they both leaned hard against it the door swung inward and spilled them abruptly into a narrow stone corridor next instant the door slammed to leaving them sitting in surprise and consternation on the rocky floor they could hear the tree pounding with all its fists against the panels but a bolt had dropped into place as the door closed so there seemed little danger of further pursuit i wish wed stop this falling about complained peter picking himself up a bit wearily were always doing something we dont expect thats because were in oz answered jack cheerfully and at any rate we have saved my head from the christmas tree peter felt inclined to remark that saving jacks head was not so very important but thinking better of it he went on in an exasperated tone christmas trees in our country dont chase people nor throw things at them they stay where theyre put yes said jack pumpkinhead blandly i suppose they do but oz christmas trees are more progressive more upandcoming taking out the silver bell the christmas tree had thrown at peter jack held it close to his ear and then swung it slowly to and fro at its first silver ring peter thinking it would rouse the owner of the cave rushed over to stop jack only to collide violently with a tiny black slave who had apparently sprung up from nowhere he wore a simply enormous turban and carried an immense silver tray regaining his balance with great composure the little black slave set the tray on the floor folded his arms and with a deep bow melted into thin air its a dinner shouted peter dropping on the floor and hungrily snatching off the white napkin that covered the tray well of all things unexpected things you mean corrected jack slyly and i notice you dont object to this one let me see that bell puffed peter reaching across the tray it was not very light in the cavern but even so he could read the inscription on the shining silver surface the red djinns dinner bell said the carved letters mysteriously a magic dinner bell exclaimed peter delightedly this certainly makes up for the bird seed and did you see that boy dissolve into nothing right before our eyes jack nodded better eat that dinner before it does the same thing he advised calmly as this seemed not at all improbable peter made short work of the roast duck mashed potatoes hot rolls and apple sauce he had just finished the last roll when tray dishes and silverware vanished suddenly shall i ring the bell again inquired jack as peter stared dazedly at the spot where the tray had been although jack was not constructed for eating he had thoroughly enjoyed watching peter no decided the little boy with a satisfied nod ive had enough and it was good but i wonder how that christmas tree got hold of the red djinns dinner bell stole it probably answered jack rubbing the bell on his sleeve maybe the old djinn didnt run fast enough anyway its a regular christmas present for you peter whenever youre hungry well just ring it with a pleased chuckle jack slipped the bell back into his pocket it certainly will be useful sighed peter patting his stomach with a contented little sigh now that his hunger was satisfied he felt quite cheerful and adventurous again lets see where this passageway leads he added peering round the dark corner at the end of the little corridor why dont you throw that old sack away inquired jack pumpkinhead as they walked slowly along the strange hallway what good is it i dont know answered peter swinging the pirates sack carelessly to and fro i had it when i landed here and it might come in handy to carry things in what kind of things asked jack stupidly peter did not bother to answer for they had come suddenly upon a great scowling goblinhead lantern under the lantern hung a flashing red sign trembledirected the sign in big red letters i dont see why we should tremble said peter squinting defiantly up at the goblin lantern at peters words the lantern went out and whistling through the dark windy corridor came such a succession of wails sighs and horrid screeches that peters heart stood still are you trembling quavered jack as the hair raising noise died away not exactly stuttered peter leaning against the wall to steady himself as the lantern flashed on again he peered anxiously all around but there was no one in sight so putting back his shoulders and taking a deep breath peter marched bravely forward theres nothing to be frightened about he called reassuringly over his shoulder well nothing certainly made enough noise murmured jack straightening his head which had spun round and round at the horrible outcrys i wish we were safely out of this dear peter peter did not say so but he heartily echoed jacks wish as they progressed along the strange corridor the goblin lanterns became more numerous and ugly and the last turn brought them to a high red spiked gate on every spike there was a frowning scare head and as the two travellers paused uncertainly each head stuck out its tongue boooo shrieked the heads all together so loud and so shrilly that peter almost took to his heels and jack without meaning to at all sat down as the little boy hurriedly tugged him to his feet the red gates swung open welcome to scare city boomed a horrid voice quake shake pale and tremble chapter scary times in scare city on the other side of the spiked gate rose a curious cliff city there was a great court in the center surrounded by a mass of jagged rocks and from the rocks narrow cliff dwellings had been crudely hewn and cut crooked carved steps led down into the courtyard and every rock and inch of wall space was covered with roughly drawn heads and frowning faces while set on stone poles at regular intervals were hundreds of goblin lanterns a bluish green smoke hung in the air and every minute or so it would rise and form into the words scare city scare city scare city so that altogether the whole effect was exceedingly grim and unpleasant so much so in fact that peter and jack turned to flee but the arm that had pulled them through the gate held them fast pause commanded a harsh voice pause pale and behold the chief scarer swallowing hard peter took an unwilling look at the gate keeper he was about six feet tall and his head seemed to be face all round with eyes on every side and noses that stuck out like spikes in every direction as peter with a little shiver turned away he began to speak again you rumbled the chief scarer pointing a skinny finger at jack are a perfect fright but you contemptuously he looked peter up and down you would not even scare a baby how dare you come here with that soft white pudding face now peter as you can well imagine was thoroughly frightened but the words of the gate keeper made him angry and anger made him bold stamping his foot and drawing his face into a terrible scowl peter stuck out his tongue is this better he demanded furiously a little a little sighed the chief scarer leaning thoughtfully on his staff could you cross your eyes dont you do it peter begged jack they might stay that way well suit yourself yawned the scarer indifferently i doubt whether either of you will pass the tests anyway and if you dont youll be turned into fraid cats or scared stiff youre supposed to tremble in the presence of the king you know and if you run youll turn to fraid cats and if you scream youll be scared stiff remember now i warned you lifting a red whistle to his lips the chief scarer blew three sharp blasts and then stepped back into his niche in the rocks whos afraid muttered peter in a defiant voice they cant scare us can they jack before jack could answer a perfect horde of scares rushed out of the rock dwellings and began to tumble and leap down the steps into the court halfway down they paused and one with a particularly frightful face bawled impressively tuhremble for you are in the presence of the king jack and peter had no trouble at all in trembling jacks knees knocked together so hard that one of the pegs fell out of his joints and his pumpkin head bounced up and down upon its peg peter twisted his hands behind him and gritted his teeth to keep from screaming he felt exactly as he had when he was a small boy and a rough crowd of halloween ghosts and goblins pounced suddenly upon him in his own front yard theyre no worse than masqueraders said peter pluckily dont run dont scream jack no matter what happens what i dont see wont frighten me answered jack and reaching up with both hands he turned his head so that the back was toward the scares each scare was different but each one was dreadful some had blue faces some red faces and others green faces but they all had dozens of noses and the result was more than terrifying scurrying here and there in between the feet of the scares were the fraid cats meouwing piteously when anyone trod on them instead of tails these singular beasts had two heads one at each end so that it was impossible to tell whether they were coming or going swallowing nervously peter resolved that whatever happened he would not run and turn into one of these twoheaded tom cats when the scares almost reached the spot where the two travellers stood trembling the one they called king stepped out on a high flat rock he had a horn for a nose a lions mane pig eyes donkey ears and billy goat whiskers three groans for harum scarum the seventh shouted his subjects and proceeded to groan most lustily while harum scarum waving both arms addressed peter and jack in words so long and frightening that the air fairly quivered and bits of rock loosened from the walls rattled down like hail stones what is he saying panted jack who still had his head turned theyre trying to scare us with big words shouted peter above the awful din dont move jack whatever you do dont move but suppose they run over us wailed jack pumpkinhead dolefully peter had thought of this himself and as the scares evidently disappointed at not making them run stopped shouting and prepared to attack he seized jacks hand and whispered frantically here they come here they come what shall we do what _shall_ we do how jack with only a pumpkin head ever thought of the magic dinner bell peter often wondered afterward but he did think of it and before the scares had advanced a foot he snatched out the bell and shook it furiously instantly the little slave appeared set a tray before peter and vanished and peter without delay seized the silver dishes full of food and hurled them at the oncoming foe the astonishment of harum scarum and his band was comical to behold hit by flying forks spoons tumblers bowls of chicken and mashed potatoes and finally by the silver tray itself they paused in utmost confusion before they could pick up the flying missiles they had disappeared and when with yells and shouts they started forward again jack rang the jinns bell a second time and a third time and a fourth time and with never a pause peter flung dinners and dishes at their heads but when jack rang the bell a fifth time the little slave appeared and looking reproachfully at peter set down only one small bowl of soup five dinners in less than five minutes was too much for even a magic dinner bell with a gasp of dismay peter flung the bowl at harum scarum and then snatching the pirate sack from his shoulder swung it defiantly round his head nothing could save them now but at least decided peter he would go down fighting jack too seemed to realize the hopelessness of their situation and turning his head boldly confronted the scares doubling up his wooden fists prepared to struggle till he fell with noodle soup in his goats beard and fury in his pig eyes harum scarum rushed at peter as he did the pirate sack jerked out of the little boys hand the strings had been loosened by peters wild swings and now the mouth was open wide sailing through the air like a small zeppelin it scooped up harum scarum then the ten scares behind him then the ten scares behind them snapping and swallowing snapping and swallowing till not a scare nor a fraid cat remained in the courtyard then swiftly the sack returned to peter and quietly collapsed at his feet there was not a sound in that whole strange city nor a single scare in the sack why didnt you tell me you had a grab bag stuttered jack tie it up quick do you want it to grab us with trembling hands and stiff fingers peter pulled the cords in the top of the sack and sinking down in a tired heap leaned his head against the stones the battle with the scares and the strange behaviour of the pirates sack had almost been too much for him where in pete had the scares gone and how could the sack be empty jack equally agitated took several jerky steps up and down and then paused in front of peter what now asked jack pumpkinhead inquiringly what now lets get out of here exclaimed peter and taking a long breath he jumped to his feet are we going to take that fearfully jack pointed to the pirates sack of course said peter trying to speak in a matter of fact voice it might help us out again do you wish to be helped out of sight wheezed jack sarcastically why it may swallow us any minute that our backs are turned not if we keep it tied answered peter with more confidence than he felt we really ought to take it to the emerald city to show the wizard i dont believe even the wizard has seen a sack like this its a trained sack i suppose that pirate taught it to swallow his enemies and now it will swallow ours all right bring it if you must but dont swing it near me straightening his head resignedly jack began looking around for the peg that had fallen out of his knee joint when peter had found and replaced the little wooden piece they hurried quickly to the entrance of the city the gate keeper had been swallowed with the rest of the scares and though jack and peter pulled and pushed and tugged they could not budge the iron bolts maybe theres another way puffed peter finally giving up the attempt turning from the entrance they walked round and round the courtyard and climbed wearily up and down the rocks but could find no break in the wall nor any way out of the grim city the dead silence now that the scares were gone was dreadfully depressing thoroughly discouraged peter and jack sat down on a block of granite leaning his head against a red pillar peter took a last despairing look around as his eye travelled slowly over the court a red stone griffin or what peter had supposed to be a red stone griffin rose majestically from the base of a pillar with a terrific stretch and yawn it opened its eyes blinked in surprise at peter and jack then raising one claw called gently who what whither why chapter peter meets the iffin boy pumpkin emerald city because answered jack who was extremely literal if everyone would answer me as sensibly as he does said the griffin id talk all day so you say youre leaving this place because because we hate it said peter looking steadily at the strange speaker so many things had happened in the last hour that peter felt only a slight twinge of surprise at the creatures curious appearance and conversation are you a griffin peter asked rubbing his forehead wearily it looked not unlike pictures he had seen of this rare and fabulous monsterbeing sandy red in color with a huge lions body and dragons claws its head instead of being the usual eagle head was of rather a doggish nature with a standup mane and inquisitive pointed ears you must be a griffin repeated peter noting the powerful wings starting from the monsters shoulders i am a griffin without the grrr answered the animal sitting dolefully back on its haunches i used to be a real griffin but since my capture and imprisonment here ive completely lost my grrr which makes me by the process of simple subtraction an iffin to while away the hours of my captivity it went on patiently i acquired the habit of thought i thought and i thought and thinking brought on iffing i began to if about this and that till i became a philosopher what is a philosopher asked jack suspiciously a philosopher is an iffin too rumbled the singular beast scratching his ear reflectively he thinks practically all the time and he says to himself if this and that are really so then so are that and this that being so tis best to go so far then one cant miss everything hinges on the if he finished brightly see im afraid i dont said jack shaking his head stupidly do you peter well i understand about the if answered the little boy who could not help grinning at jacks puzzled expression if the iffin will just show us the way out of scare city well go and not miss a single thing if it were not for the scares i would wheezed the big beast peering nervously up at the rocks but its no use theyll only turn you to fraid cats or statues besides im chained he lifted one paw to which a heavy chain and padlock were attached the other end of the chain was fastened to the base of the pillar say you must be a sound sleeper marvelled jack didnt you hear the big battle this boy and i have conquered the whole city and harum scarum and the scares are gonevanished done for gone cried the iffin lashing its tail in astonishment how when where jack pointed silently to the sack which peter still had over one shoulder and peter quickly told of their exciting encounter with the citizens of scare city of the great usefulness of the red jinns dinner bell and the way the pirate sack had finally swallowed down the whole company of horrors at peters recital the iffins eyes grew rounder and rounder and as he finished it put up both wings and with short agitated jumps shrieked the scares are gone then what scare we the scares are gone were free were free loose this chain it panted tugging impatiently away from the post as peter now as excited as the iffin looked hurriedly around for a bar or stone to break the padlock jack stepped forward and warningly held up his hand just what do you eat asked jack pumpkinhead in an anxious voice are you carniverous if an iffin were carniverous would he relish red geraniums i live on flowers solely so please get that through your craniums what did you think i ate little boys finished the iffin sulkily well you never can tell murmured jack with a worried glance at peter i just wanted to be sure peter chuckled to himself and while looking for a spike discovered a gold key suspended from a nail on one of the red pillars taking the key he fitted it into the rusty padlock and after several unsuccessful attempts it turned and the heavy chain fell with a loud clank to the red paving stones do you really eat geraniums asked peter as the iffin sprang away from the post and rushed in crazy circles around the court yard of course it snorted boisterously of course then spreading its wide red wings it soared majestically into the airup up and out of sight why its gone shouted jack pumpkinhead indignantly theres gratitude for you gone and left us without even a claw shake or thank you maybe it will come back kicking aside the chain peter strained his eyes to catch a glimpse of the flying monster but not one speck showed in the murky sky overhead if jack and peter had been blue before they were navy blue now with their only means of escape removed they looked blankly at one another while the goblin lanterns glowed and smoked and the sulphurous air of the cliff city grew more dry and unbearable if id only made it promise to help us before i turned the key sighed peter regretfully hah so youre an iffin too peering around a pillar the bright red eyes of the sandy colored beast winked merrily into peters just trying out my wings it explained gruffly and theyre wonderful if you dont think so listen to them swirl and whirl and swish climb on my back ill carry you to any place you wish will you really cried peter falling joyfully on the iffins neck can you take us to the emerald city if you want me to answered the iffin wagging its tail bashfully have you a name inquired jack pumpkinhead getting stiffly off the granite block well said the iffin slowly ive been here so long i forgot my real name but the scares called me snif im not sure i know the way to the emerald city but i will fly over the wall into the land of the barons and there we can surely find some one to direct us since you have freed me from my captors i will serve you faithfully for seven years hurrah shouted peter hugging jack im not sure i can stay in oz that long but im certainly glad we fell into this city meeting you was worth all the trouble in reply the iffin chortled if you hadnt come id be here yet so im glad as a gluckbird that we met whats a gluckbird asked jack straightening his head and looking rather severely at the irrepressible monster if i knew id tell you confided the iffin coming close to whisper in jacks ear lets make ourselves scarce around here he called boisterously in the next breath oh lets agreed peter swinging up the pirates sack you mount first jack and be sure to hold fast to your head and be sure that bags shut added the iffin wiggling his nose rapidly ive never travelled with a magic sack and though i fly im no swallow is the dinner bell all right asked peter tightening the cord of the pirates sack and helping jack climb on snifs back there was just room for the pumpkinhead to sit astride in front of the iffins wings and peter settled himself comfortably back of jack between the mighty pinions with one last scornful look at the red city the iffin rose into air mounting higher till the goblin lights of scare city were no larger than fire flys twinkling below were you a prisoner long asked peter as snif flew swiftly over a bright red forest five years bellowed the big beast looking over its shoulder flying seemed no effort at all and it talked quite easily as it flew the first year it explained sadly i struggled and growled so hard in my efforts to escape that i completely lost my gurrr see clearing its throat the iffin attempted a growl but succeeded in producing only a faint squeak after i lost my gurr it went on in a melancholy voice i amused myself making up iffish verses a habit i fear i shall never recover from i like it said peter after a short pause it reminds me of scraps shes a live patchwork girl who lives in the emerald city scraps talks in verses all the time if the patchwork girl can talk in rhyme she must be most as smart as im smiled snif with a wink at jack pumpkinhead she is laughed peter with a reminiscent chuckle i say there must have been a lot of travellers from the number of fraid cats in scare city why did they have two heads so theyd be forced to look at scares which ever way they turned sighed the iffin every scare had his cave full of statues of people who had come to scare city by mistake and been frightened stiff you were lucky to escape well admitted peter with pardonable pride its pretty hard to scare the captain of a baseball team and jack is not easily frightened either so i see ersaw observed the iffin politely when we reach the emerald city ozma will find a way to release all of these prisoners wherever they are said peter confidently but how did they capture you i dropped into the city at night said the iffin and before i saw how bad it was they overpowered and chained me up they wanted me to stay and devour all travellers and even when i refused they kept me as a curiosity and thats all ill be from now on it wheezed heavily ill never get the taste of sulphur out of my throat the picture of the scares out of my mind or be able to growl again im quite all wrong you seem all right to me said peter with a little sigh of content wait till you see the emerald city youll forget all about the scares and never ever want to leave again will he jack never answered jack with a solemn nod i have heard the capitol is very lovely mused the iffin but my home is beautiful too where do you live inquired peter jack was too busy holding on his head to join in the conversation in the land of the barons among these hills pausing in mid air the iffin pointed with its claw to the rolling hillside below here and there above the trees and on the hill tops lordly castles reared their round red towers flags fluttered from every turret and peter had to admit that the land of the barons looked extremely interesting and gay are these barons pleasant fellows he asked putting a steadying arm around jack pumpkinhead the iffin answered in verse if theyre good theyre good as pie but some are bad and make things flyeven me you mean there are all kinds mused peter yes said the iffin and theyre always fighting but i dont mind battles i just fly around till theyre over and theyre quite interesting to watch i hope we dont land in the middle of a battle sighed peter and i hope the first baron we meet is a good fellow and knows the way to the emerald city if he is and if he does well be as gay as never was and if hes not and if he dont well find a way swumped if we wont you use such funny words sniffed peter as the monster circled lower and lower but the iffin made no answer this time for he was looking for a good place to land presently he found one and next instant they dropped gently down into a peaceful valley as peter and jack tumbled off in great excitement snif folded his wings and blinking selfconsciously murmured well here we are do you like it chapter the bearded baron appears after scare city almost any place would have looked beautiful to jack and peter and this quiet valley overgrown with vines and sweet smelling flowers seemed lovely indeed youre a whiz snif exclaimed the little boy looking around appreciatively why you travel faster than an aeroplane youre even better than one for you can walk and talk as well as fly swim too grunted the iffin panting a little from the exertion of the journey now if youll excuse me i think ill run along and find some geraniums they grow wild around here and im wild about em dont get lost begged jack pumpkinhead for this accommodating new steed seemed almost too precious to let out of their sight shall i go with him he whispered hurriedly to peter it might hurt his feelings said peter dropping luxuriously into the long fine grass lets rest till he comes back and then we can hunt up one of these barons and inquire the way to the emerald city rolling over on his back and looking up at the drifting summer clouds peter gave a long sigh of content why this is almost as interesting as my last trip to oz jacktravelling around with you this way and meeting an iffin and everything no matter what happens were not so badly off for we have a sack to swallow our enemies a magic dinner bell to supply us with food and an enchanted steed to carry us wherever we wish to go gee i wish some of the fellows were along i wish my grandfather had been with us in scare city you were great jack to think of that dinner bell was i leaning against a tall young beech jack beamed down at peter you were great too he insisted generously i never saw anyone throw so straight and so hard playing baseball does that explained peter clasping his arms behind his head well have to have a game when we reach the capitol say look here are some wild strawberries scooping them up by the handful peter began to eat hungrily did you ever see such large ones the quadling country is noted for its red fruits answered jack proudly its strawberries apples cherries and red bananas sometimes i wish i were made to enjoy eating he finished looking rather wistfully at peter you do miss a lot agreed the little boy sympathetically but then on the other hand you never suffer from hunger and could never starve to death but here comes snif swallowing the last of the strawberries peter ran to meet the iffin several geraniums still drooped from the corners of his mouth and he was loping along humming cheerfully to himself all aboard for the emerald city he called merrily as he came closer that ought to please your long legged friend there hes all board from his neck down anyway smiling at snifs little joke peter picked up the pirates sack helped jack to mount and sprang nimbly up behind him are we going to fly or walk he asked curiously waddle puffed the iffin with a droll wink im so full of geraniums id simply sink if i tried to fly so if youre all ready well waddle along im afraid waddling wont be at all good for my head objected jack as the iffin started off with swinging uneven strides peter laughed as jack continued to protest against waddling but the iffin was too busy practising gurrs to pay any attention to the pumpkinhead its funny it muttered between its teeth i can say gurr but i cant growl it and until i can growl im no griffin oh what do you care said peter any old grouch can growl but not many can fly swim waddle and make verses like you do id rather be an iffin than a griffin any day thats because you never were either sighed the big monster with a little shake of his head and quickening his pace he galloped along so swiftly that peter and jack had all they could do to hang on once out of the valley the country spread before them like a gay and enchanting map little patches of shadow lay on the velvety hills small wooded parks dotted the hollows and many castles were visible in the distance beyond a huge range of red mountains lifted their craggy heads to the sky well stop at the first castle decided the iffin jumping without effort a tall timber fence that enclosed one of the parks red deer scattered right and left as the huge monster rushed by and they were progressing finely when from the center of the park where the trees were thickest came a sharp shrill wail perhaps wed better try the second castle panted the iffin flattening back his ears if that looks like it sounds i prefer not to look its either a snort or a sort of gazook before jack could inquire what a snort or gazook might be before the iffin could even turn steps came pattering toward them and out through the trees rushed a tall trembling old man in a red cloak i am a mess i am a mess i am a mess he croaked flinging out both arms desperately tut tut reproved the iffin putting up his ears if you dont shout it so loud maybe no one will find you out keep it quiet i beg of you i am a mess i am a mess a miserable mesmerizer insisted the old man drawing his hand wearily across his brow and leaning heavily against a tree its against the law to mes to mesi mean to mesmerize said jack staring severely at the strange apparition ozma has forbidden the practise of magic in oz dont you know that i know no law but the law of belfaygor of bourne said the old man haughtily and who is belfaygor inquired peter standing up on the iffins back to get a better view of this curious person lord of these lands and my illustrious master alas alas what have i done unhappy him unhappy i unhappy us i am a mess i am a mess a most miserable mesmerizer burying his face in his hands the old man rushed blindly past them and long after he had gone his piercing groans came echoing back to them now what do you suppose he did do asked peter settling himself thoughtfully between the iffins wings belfaygor belfaygor mused snif repeating the name over several times i remember nowhes one of the good barons lets go on to his castle and see what has happened to him but they did not have to wait till they reached the castle to find out for halfway through the park they came upon the baron himself his ruby crown magnificent red boots richly embroidered cape proclaimed his rank at once but it was his beard that peter saw first and never forgot afterwarda red beard that flashed and flowed down his breast and swirled around his feet in an angry red tide with his head thrown back a pair of shears in each hand belfaygor was clipping desperately at the shining waves that seemed to pour in a steady torrent from his chin at each clip he groaned and at each groan he clipped my beard choked the baron my bride and my beard and so engrossed and distressed was the unhappy gentleman that he neither saw nor heard the iffins approach so this is what comes of mesmerizing snorted snif stopping so suddenly he almost unseated his riders his beard is running away with him what can we do about it can we be of any help called peter more practically is there anything we can do mr baron at peters question belfaygor gave a great start then blinking up half seeingly at the strange company gloomily shook his head nothing can help me moaned the baron clipping furiously for nothing can stop this beard from growing and thats not the worst mogodore the mighty has stolen the princess i was to marry and each time i try to run to rescue her my beard trips me up woe woe woe was ever a man so unhappyso unlucky as i illustration miserable mesmerizer repeated the baron dully where are your men asked snif wrinkling up his nose anxiously gone said the baron dully frightened off by my beard they have deserted me down to the smallest train bearer you dont need a train bearer what you need is a beard bearer puffed jack pumpkinhead dismounting stiffly and stepping as close as he dared to the baron if you throw your beard over your shoulder it will grow the other way he suggested amiably for a moment belfaygor stared slowly at jack then flinging the red beard over one shoulder he extended both arms thats the only sensible thing ive heard since i was mesmerized he shouted hoarsely i hereby appoint you royal bearer of the beard thanks murmured jack looking doubtfully at peter who are you demanded the baron in growing excitement and appreciation this griffin i have seen before but you my good fellow are most odd and curious he is a pumpkinhead magically brought to life volunteered peter and some pumpkins he finished with a wink at the iffin no only one corrected jack modestly i am a subject of ozma of oz and this boy is from america as we are all on our way to the emerald city i cannot bear your beard neither can i mourned the baron dropping his arms wearily oh oh who will save poor little shirley sunshine the baron looked so tired and dejected that peter felt sorry for him is shirley sunshine the princess you are to marry he asked curiously who is this mogodore why not tell us the whole story maybe we can help you if wings will help and a magic sack youll soon have your little princess back promised the iffin sitting on his haunches beside peter speak he urged raising his claw imperiously speak for we are all attention chapter belfaygors strange story with a gusty sigh the red baron looked from one to another and then fixing his eyes sadly on peter he began to speak since the extremely sensible suggestion of jack pumpkinhead his beard no longer poured round his ankles but sweeping over his shoulder disappeared in a red streak between the trees every little while he would cut it off and the steady snipsnip of the shears ran like a sharp punctuation all through the strange story of his misfortune this morning confided belfaygor in a mournful voice this morning i was the happiest lord in the land for my marriage with shirley sunshine whose father lives on the next hillside had been satisfactorily arranged my palace had been redecorated to please the princess and all my retainers newly outfitted for the wedding everything in fact was in readiness to receive her and i myself was about to start for her fathers castle when i became suddenly dissatisfied with my appearance overcome by his feelings the baron paused for a full moment and peter stood up on snifs back to see how far the red beard had grown since the last clip with a little gasp he saw it shoot through the branches of a tall tulip tree and as he sat down belfaygor tearfully continued his recital so i sent for my chief mesmerizer he said sorrowfully a good old man and exceedingly well versed in necromancy i asked him if it would be possible to grow a beard as i felt that a fine long beard would greatly improve my appearance there was not time to grow one naturally so this mesmerizer this miserable mesmerizer corrected the iffin switching his tail furiously miserable mesmerizer repeated the baron dully caused a long red beard to grow upon my chin snipping off a silky length of the offending whiskers he tossed the ends over one shoulder and with a deep sigh proceeded when the beard had grown to my waist i bade the mesmerizer stop it but in spite of all his incantations and magic powders it continued to grow it grew and grew till it filled the throne room ran down the stairs into the pantry shot up the stairs into the bed rooms and finally filled every room in the palace in real danger of suffocation my knights and servants took to their heels and my mesmerizer after forcing these shears upon me and bidding me cut for dear life ran off and left me also then how did you get out of the castle asked peter lurching forward while jack leaned over so far his head fell off and had to be replaced by the iffin jumped out a window explained the baron with a little shudder the beard kept me from breaking any bones cutting myself loose from the terrible tangle i ran into the middle of the road and called loudly for help as i did a commotion on the next hillside attracted my attention a band of armed riders were galloping toward me as they drew nearer i recognized the plumed hats and golden spears of mogodores retainers and as they came nearer still i saw that mogodore himself was carrying off my bride who lay unconscious across his saddle bow i tried to scream but the red beard enveloped me i tried to run it tripped me at every step without even seeing me the cavalcade thundered by as they disappeared i heard two of the riders boasting that mogodore would marry shirley sunshine tomorrow morning when was that where did he take her gasped peter how long ago was it this morning choked belfaygor he has carried her to his castle in baffleburg you mean to say all of your men ran off and never came back exclaimed peter springing up indignantly well dont you care were here now and im sure ozma would want us to help you well just fly on snifs back to baffleburg and snatch her away from this bandit im afraid you have never heard of mogodore interrupted the baron shaking his head despairingly no one has ever entered the city of baffleburg or returned alive from mogodores mountain if that is so well be the first to tame this wretch or know the worst roared the iffin coming to his feet with a bound i guess you never heard of peter said jack pumpkinhead rising with great dignity this boyhe waved impressively in peters directionhas just conquered the entire city of scares and the last time he was in oz he saved the emerald city from the gnome king while belfaygor looked incredulously at the little boy jack told of their mornings experiences in chimneyville and scare city have you still got the pirates sack asked belfaygor forgetting to clip his beard in his extreme interest and astonishment that magic dinner bellwhat is it do you suppose you could carry us all to baffleburg eagerly he turned to snif the iffin raised both of his powerful wings and shook his head confidently while jack held up the dinner bell and peter showed the famous sack well be there in no time cried peter and with all this magic i dont see how mogodore can conquer us do you belfaygor was so cheered and encouraged by this little speech that he dropped both pairs of shears and embraced peter upon the spot you shall be knighted for this my boy he promised you too he added pressing jacks wooden fingers earnestly what about me inquired snif raising a claw solemnly if this keeps up well all be knighted sir jack sir pete why am i slighted youre not promised belfaygor quickly picking up his shears and beginning to snip furiously youll be knighted too well if you insist murmured the iffin in a mollified tone but i wont wear armor come on knights he called gaily for night is coming on and if were to reach baffleburg before dark wed better start now the very name of baffleburg gave peter a thrill more interested and excited than he had been since his arrival in oz he helped jack to mount the iffins back and hurriedly seated himself behind him belfaygor came next with his back to peter so his beard would not blow in the little boys face and after a glance back to see that his riders were safe and comfortable snif spread his great wings and soared aloft flying straight toward the red mountains peter had seen in the distance as they rose higher and higher belfaygor found it no longer necessary to ply his shears and his bright red beard streamed like a waving banner behind them the poor baron was glad indeed for this rest for he had been clipping steadily since early morning and already had blisters on both thumbs now and then when his beard seemed in danger of catching in a tree or winding about a castle tower he would snip it off short again and peter and jack would watch it float away like some strange red cloud flying was such an exhilarating experience that peter forgot all about the dangerous adventure that lay ahead and the forbidding aspect of mogodores mountain did not trouble him at all as they drew closer he could see the city of baffleburg its turreted forts and its castle and strong houses seeming to spring from the rock itself stretching round the mountain there was a yawning chasm and at the foot was a towered fortress and drawbridge over which mogodore and his men crossed the chasm when they made war on the barons below red capped warriors stood in each embrasure of the fort and guards marched stiffly to and fro upon the city walls the grim red castle clung to the rocks halfway up the mountain and gave mogodore a splendid view of the whole valley beneath if i fly too near a golden spear may interrupt our flight so lets descend and mix a little stratagem with might muttered the iffin coasting cautiously downward stratagems a big word sighed jack pumpkinhead what does it mean a plan to confuse the enemy explained peter as the iffins feet touched the rocky ground on the other side of the chasm we must find the best place to drop into the city the best way to use the pirates sack and the quickest plan for finding the princess belfaygor was the first to dismount throwing his beard impatiently over his shoulder he frowned gloomily up at mogodores mountain now that they were really before the city of baffleburg the cheerful plans and hopes of peter and the iffin seemed wild and impractical the longer he looked the more impossible they seemed and resting his hand heavily on peters shoulder he begged the little boy to continue his journey to the emerald city and leave him to deal with the wicked mountain chief the iffin can carry me into the city sighed belfaygor but i cannot let you share in the awful perils of this undertaking if peter had not been in oz or addressing a baron he might have answered applesauce but feeling that such a word would only puzzle this dignified nobleman he seated himself on the nearest rock and looked curiously across the chasm i should think mused peter that the best plan would be to fly into the city under cover of darkness and drop into the castle courtyard once inside i will open the pirates sack and when it has swallowed mogodore and all the fighting men we can safely search for the princess and escape how do you know the sack wont swallow her too questioned belfaygor uneasily because said peter looking up at the tallest tower in the castle i believe shes locked up there they always lock the princess up in the tower he finished confidently you think of everything jack pumpkinhead stared down at the little boy admiringly and snif who had been scouting around for a stray geranium waved an approving claw at peter if thats the plan lets have a bite and quietly stay here till night but what shall we eat said belfaygor clipping at his whiskers despondently jack chuckled at this and drawing out the red jinns bell rang it imperiously at once the little black slave bearing his silver tray appeared before them placing the tray on peters knees he faded out of sight so suddenly that belfaygor dropped his shears with a clatter though he had heard about the magic dinner bell the unexpected appearance of the dinner quite upset him you take this one said peter generously and if you sit with your back to the chasm and throw your beard over your shoulder it will grow down into the opening and let you eat in peace how can i ever thank you exclaimed the baron seating himself as the little boy suggested odds pasties this looks most tempting with a long tremulous sigh belfaygor fell upon the appetizing repast of roast beef and plum pudding then jack rang the bell again and the slave appeared with a tray for peter he was about to ring up another dinner for snif but the iffin shook his head ive had enough for one day he told them firmly and if peter will give me that bunch of violets everything will be perfectly perk as an extra touch a small bunch of violets had been placed beside peters dinner plate tossing them gaily to the iffin and thinking as he did so how curious it was for so huge a beast to dine upon flowers peter started in on his own dinner with both hands clasped behind him jack watched the sun sink down behind the grim red mountain and peter and belfaygor were so hungry that neither spoke till all the plates on their trays were empty then with a satisfied sigh peter stood up and as the trays disappeared began looking around for snif but there was no sign of the iffin anywhere oh gasped peter anxiously forgetting for the moment that snif could fly he must have fallen into the chasm calling to jack and the baron he started to run along the edge of the ravine striking impatiently at a small creature that kept beating its wings in his face he thought he had brushed it aside when with an angry screech it fastened its claws in his shoulder if you hit me again ill bite your ear attention pause stop look and hear at the familiar verses peter did stop and glancing down he saw a creature no bigger than a squirrel perched on his shoulder its me wailed a desperate voice as the tiny beast leaned over and rubbed its head against his cheek those violets it choked bitterly those violets were shrinking violets peter look at me ive shrunk i might just as well throw myself away dont gulped peter as the iffin started to hurl itself from his shoulder i like you little well i like him big announced jack unfeelingly and whos to carry us over the chasm now may i ask oh groaned belfaygor tripping over his whiskers after one horrified look at the little monster everything is over everything is over now sos your old beard mumbled jack in an annoyed voice picking up the shears belfaygor had dropped he cut length after length from the enchanted red beard while the baron continued to wring his hands and groan and peter tried in vain to comfort the iffin chapter a way to cross the chasm ill wager that old jinn did this on purpose declared jack indignantly ill ring that dumbbell again and the boys neck too it wasnt his fault put in peter lifting snif from his shoulder and thoughtfully stroking the small red head i dont suppose those violets were meant to be eaten if i only hadnt eaten them wailed the iffin as two tears rolled down his cheeks youve no idea how it feels to shrink boys why did i eat those violets i feel so sil and small im just an elf im not myself im just no one at all oh yes you are peter reassured him hastily why look youll fit right in my pocket and ill carry you for a change and when we reach the emerald city the wizard of oz will soon make you large again are we to reach the emerald city inquired jack looking up from snipping belfaygors beard and how do you know you wont shrink yourself peter turned a little pale at jacks question the baron and i didnt eat any violets he answered swallowing hastily yes but how are we to cross the chasm belfaygor taking the shears from jack rolled his eyes sadly at peter well just have to think of some other way said peter staring off at mogodores mountain lets all think i can only think of poor little shirley sunshine locked up in that dismal tower retorted belfaygor despondently i can only think how far it must be to the bottom of this crevice muttered jack looking sadly down into the ravine it looks to me as if wed have to do all the thinking for this party murmured snif flying up on peters shoulder never mind i still can think even if i am little if i do a little thinking and i think a little bit if theres any way to cross it why ill surely think of it im glad you can still make verses said peter with a sigh it helps and makes things seem a little less awful yes said the iffin resting his cheek against peters the sun had dropped down behind the red castle and in the gray light of early evening the grim city on the rocks looked more forbidding than ever great black crows circled about the towers and turrets and their hoarse crys drifted like threatening jeers across the chasm if we had an ax said peter gloomily we might chop down a tree on the edge of the chasm so it would fall across he was just wondering whether the ravine was narrow enough to jump at any point when snif gave a little bounce and flying off his shoulder announced shrilly i have thought of a way well cross on the barons beard you mean grow across asked jack pumpkinhead doubtfully impossible roared belfaygor throwing up his shears and hands indignantly wouldst jerk out my whiskers besides they grow down and not up pause holding up one claw the iffin looked solemnly from one to the other first explained snif quietly belfaygor must walk three times around a tree that will make his beard fast and keep it from pulling then i will take the end of the beard in my claws fly across the chasm and fasten it to a tree on the other side then when peter and jack have crossed the baron can snip off the beard close to his chin and cross himself in safety what think you of that my brave comrades why thats a perfectly splendid idea cried peter jumping up enthusiastically how ever did you think of it well snif reminded him gaily for five years i did nothing but thinkso thinking comes easy to me how about it baron will you lend us your beard yes answered belfaygor readily enough now that he had heard the iffins plan even if it hurts i will do it ill do anything to save shirley sunshine from that villainous bandit then everythings settled cried peter who hated delay or inactivity of any kind lets start not now said the iffin shaking his little head seriously we must wait till morning peter as i cannot carry you all up to the castle itself you will have to climb over the rocks and cliffs to the city gates this will be bad enough by daylight but impossible at night thats so agreed peter regretfully and whats to become of us when we reach the city gates quavered jack in a hollow voice will not these baffleburghers impale us upon their spears oh i hope not muttered the iffin settling down on peters shoulder but well have to take a chance on it my guess is that the guards will seize and carry you to mogodore once in mogodores presence peter can open the sack and after the sack swallows everyone well find the princess and return to the capitol on foot what about my beard asked belfaygor nervously if they make us prisoners and take away my shears well all be smothered well so will they snif reminded him philosophically and that will be some comfort already snif seemed to have forgotten his dreadful mishap and to have recovered his former good spirits and under the influence of the merry little monster the whole party grew quite cheerful and gay come along he called flying on ahead lets find some place to sleep is that a cave i see over there back among the rocks at the foot of a tall cliff there was a cave sure enough and peter after a little exploring decided it would be just the place in which to spend the night lengths cut from belfaygors beard and piled on the floor made splendid mattresses and as jack pumpkinhead required no rest he offered to stand guard at the entrance the baron himself lay with his head just outside the cave and the obliging pumpkinhead promised to cut his beard from time to time and see that it did not choke up the opening nor suffocate the sleepers so much had happened since peter fell into the pumpkin field he was weary as a walrus and glad enough to rest by the time the moon had climbed to the top of mogodores mountain he was fast asleep the iffin curled cozily in the bend of his arm and soon only the snores of belfaygor and the snip of jacks shears broke the deep dark silence of the night chapter the forbidden flagon while peter and his friends rested in their hidden cave the lights in the castle across the chasm burned far into the night as the baron of baffleburg sat in converse with wagarag his chief steward and major domo biggen and little the barons body guards dozed stiffly at their posts behind his chair while the huge hunting dogs snored upon the hearthstones flaring torches set in stone holders in the wall flung a flickering light into the dim corners of the great stone hall bear rugs were strewn about the flagged floor swords daggers and glittering armor hung upon the walls and the furniture the carved chests tables and chairs were big and clumsy like the owner of the castle himself with his chin resting in the palm of his hand mogodore stared moodily into the fire but wagarag a thin anxious little baffleburgher moved about restlessly straightening a tapestry here a table cover there and never still for a moment if i only knew what was in that miserable flagon muttered the baron for about the fiftieth time if i only knew why must it be hidden why is it forbidden what would happen if i broke the seal buttered billygoats spluttered wagarag impatiently on the very eve of your wedding must you still worry about that wretched flask can you think of nothing but that miserable flagon flicking at a bit of gold dust on the mantel wagarag paused in exasperation before his master if your father and grandfather before you were able to guard and keep it safely why cannot you let it rest where no one will discover its secret is it not written in the book of baffleburg that if aught disturbs the seal on the forbidden flagon or one drop of the contents spills a dreadful disaster will befall are you not mogodore the mighty slayer of an hundred bears subduer of an hundred barons and lord of this mountain have you not stolen for your bride the loveliest princess in the valley pray dismiss this mischievous flagon from your mind think of something else begged wagarag earnestly something pleasant this princess for instance wagarag clasped his hands and rolled his eyes upward a beauteous damsel if i may be permitted to say so but she refuses to marry me growled mogodore crossing his legs irritably what difference does that make sniffed wagarag poking the fire energetically your word is law in baffleburg marry her anyway but i cant understand it breathed mogodore taking up a mirror that lay on the arm of his chair and surveying himself long and earnestly the reflection in the mirror stared as earnestly back but mogodore could see nothing amiss with the red face bristling black whiskers and hair small blue eyes great nose and crooked mouth that confronted him no it cannot be my looks grunted the baron setting down the mirror what does this precious princess want he demanded fretfully why not ask her suggested wagarag prodding biggen and little vigorously in the ribs here you lazy rogues fetch down the princess from the tower mayhap the princess sleepeth mumbled biggen rubbing his eyes and yawning terrifically then wakeneth her and bringeneth her thither commanded wagarag giving biggen a push and little a poke but the princess as you may well imagine was far from sleeping pacing restlessly up and down the small tower room she was trying to think of some way to escape and when biggen and little thumped on the door and explained that her presence was desired below she went readily enough hoping it might give her another chance to plead with the baron for her liberty or wheedle the guards into releasing her but biggen and little paid small attention to her entreaties roughly thrusting back the ruby necklace she offered if they would help her slip out of the castle they picked her up bodily and carried her down to their master well exclaimed mogodore as shirley sunshine drew herself up proudly against one of the great stone pillars do you still refuse to marry me of course answered the little princess haughtily release me at once or my father and belfaygor will come and destroy you utterly destroy me roared the baron with an evil wink at wagarag do you not know that i am mogodore the mighty boldest of all the barons and lord of this mountain only one mountain said the princess shaking back her long brown curls scornfully if you are as mighty as you pretend i should think youd conquer several there are no more mountains worth conquering stormed mogodore thumping the arm of his chair with his fist and you know that well enough yes but there are other countries said the princess haughtily seeing the baron give a surprised start and realizing that he was as vain as he was cruel shirley decided to flatter her villainous conqueror and delay the wedding by any trick or plan she could manage if i had your strength and fighting ability id conquer and keep on conquering until i was a king said the princess with an imperious gesture would you like me better if i were a king asked mogodore leaning forward eagerly the princess nodded so emphatically that her curls danced briskly to and fro and with a cry that shook the very rafters mogodore leaped out of his chair then ill be a king he shouted exuberantly ill march across the red mountains capture the emerald city depose this foolish little fairy ozma and proclaim myself king of oz better let well enough alone cautioned wagarag running anxiously after his master who was striding excitedly up and down the hearth there is a wizard in the emerald city who is exceedingly powerful and ozma herself is a practiced magician puff on their magic cried mogodore snapping his fingers contemptuously how can ozma who is small and weak overcome a big fellow like me nayargue not ill conquer the emerald city and be a king king mogodore the first of oz i wonder i never thought of it myself youre going to be a great help to me my dear pausing before the princess mogodore patted her clumsily on the head and whats more you shall accompany me to the capitol see this capturing done be married in the emerald city and crowned with ozmas crown he promised recklessly but now you must have some rest for well start tomorrow morning see that im called early he blustered shaking his finger at wagarag see that my fighting men are roused at daybreak he roared knocking the heads of biggen and little smartly together when im king of oz i can open that forbidden flagon he confided hoarsely leaning down to whisper in wagarags ear no more of this wretched wondering what will baffleburg matter when im king of the realm ill put an end to this unbearable mystery this princess has brought me luck come kiss me little one but shirley sunshine with a horrified glance at the boisterous baron picked up her skirts and fled from the room see that she does not escape rumbled mogodore indulgently and biggen and little clattering after the princess locked her securely in the tower alone in the comfortless room the captive princess leaned against the barred windows and fixing her eyes upon one steadfast star wondered how long it would be before belfaygor or her father came to rescue her her heart sank at the thought of this cruel baron marching upon the emerald city laying waste its parks and palaces and enslaving all of its gay and gentle inhabitants terrified by the frightful forces she had set in motion the tired little princess threw herself upon the hard bed and cried herself to sleep below in the castle hall wagarag endeavored to turn the baron from his audacious purpose listen not to this mischievous maiden begged the steward stay here where you are known and powerful it is better to be a ruler among fools than a fool among rulers many have attempted to conquer the kingdom of oznot one has succeeded then i will be the first boasted mogodore and snatching a broad sword from the wall he swung it expertly round his head shine up your shin guards waggy old lad for youre going with me and i hereby appoint you royal chancellor of oz keeper of the kings custard and imperial purveyor of puddings laughing uproariously mogodore brought the flat of his sword down with a resounding thwack upon the thin shoulders of his disapproving steward come to bed dunce he cried good naturedly you mean well but know nothing at least i know my place muttered wagarag shaking his head gloomily we both belong on this mountain and no good will come of this expedition you forget the flagon exulted mogodore i shall at last know the secret of the forbidden flagon have it your own way sighed wagarag with a resigned shrug but dont blame me if were all turned to sticks by the wizard of oz and thrown into the fire ha ha shouted mogodore more amused than frightened by this terrible threat youll make a splendid stick old fellow laughing noisily the bad bold baron tramped cheerfully off to bed chapter the city of baffleburg a strange shrill squeaking wakened peter next morning and starting up he saw that it was the iffin sitting on a flat stone the tiny monster was practising his grrrs if only i could growl again i wouldnt mind my size mourned snif looking sadly up at peter cant fight cant growl a fine fix for a fabulous monster but you can think answered peter cheerfully and youre free just wait till weve conquered this silly old baron and come to the emerald city youll be a sureenough griffin then but i kinda like you little he added loyally and i should think it would be rather an interesting experience well acknowledged the iffin scratching his ear reflectively with his third hind claw at least it will be something to tell my grandchildren if i ever have any grandchildren raising his voice to a tiny roar he rushed to the front of the cave calling loudly what ho without i do not see a hoe of any kind answered jack pumpkinhead blandly but the sun is up and the wind is changing and unless we move away from here well be buried in whiskers stepping outside peter saw a red mound as huge as ten hay stacks rolled into one all night jack had faithfully cut belfaygors beard and raked the cut lengths neatly together but now the wind was whirling the top off the stack and filling the air with a blinding tangle of red strands hastily waking the baron the four adventurers hurried to the other side of the cliff and watched the great red cloud sweep into the chasm and now to beard this baron in his den proposed snif swinging himself gaily back and forward on the branches of a small tree yes let us be off at once sighed belfaygor taking the shears from jack and starting in on his weary work of clipping lets have breakfast suggested peter who was always hungriest in the morning ring the old bell jack then goodbye quavered snif flying into the air ill be back when those trays have disappeared and not before no more magic repasts for me while peter and belfaygor breakfasted royally on beef steak and fried potatoes snif nibbled daintily at the red honeysuckle that clung to the rocks and muttered little iffish verses to himself have you ever been to baffleburg asked peter after the trays had vanished and snif came back to perch upon his shoulder is it so very dangerous i have flown over mogodores mountain many times said snif thoughtfully and from what i have seen it must be pretty bad but if we stick together and most bravely persevere this mountains dangers well surmount and tweak yon bandits ears no tweaking advised jack pumpkinhead nervously let us just sack the city and leave all right agreed snif good naturedly but we cant leave till we start so lets get started he looked inquiringly at belfaygor and belfaygor after a nervous glance across the chasm stepped to a tree on the edge of the ravine and walked solemnly three times round till his beard was securely fastened now that the time for action had come the adventurers said little belfaygor stood proudly erect waiting for his beard to grow long enough to stretch across the chasm and soon it did and snif taking the ends in his claws flew over the deep ravine and fastened the beard tightly to a tree on the other side now all was ready and peter dropping boldly over the edge swung himself skillfully across on the swinging red cable he dared not look down and once safely over watched uneasily while jack pulled himself across whatever you do dont lose your head breathed peter leaning forward nervously halfway over jacks wooden fingers almost lost their hold and his pumpkin head spun about upon its peg but snif flying valiantly to the rescue held it in place and when at last jack came near enough for peter to reach he clutched both wooden arms and dragged jack thankfully to safety belfaygor now clipped off his beard close to the chin and crossed himself without mishap or difficulty illustration _belfaygor clipped off his beard and crossed himself without mishap or difficulty_ the first step of the dangerous undertaking had been made in safety but straight ahead was a steep wall of rock if it had not been for belfaygors beard they would never have been able to scale this dreadful precipice but snif taking the beard in his claws flew up till he found a boulder or sturdy sapling then winding the beard several times round he would signal to belfaygor who would immediately snip off his end of the beard and climb expertly up the swinging rope peter hoisting himself up after him could not help but think what a splendid alpine guide the baron would make but jack tremblingly following peter resolved that if ever he reached the emerald city again he would stay peaceably at home for the rest of his unnatural life in this interesting but perilous fashion they finally reached the top of the cliff only to find the gates of the city still farther up a rocky opening into a narrow tunnel apparently led directly to baffleburg and with many misgivings the travellers entered the tunnel although it was dark and clammy inside and exceedingly rough underfoot they reached the end without trouble in the dim murky light peter saw a wooden door with an iron ring in the center he was about to grasp the ring when the tunnel without any warning tipped downward and shot them headlong from the opening snatching at a tree just in time peter saved himself from pitching over the precipice belfaygors beard catching on a jagged rock saved him and fortunately the baron had hold of jack his head did bounce off but by some miracle rolled into a hollow in the rocks snif went over the edge of the cliff but spreading his wings flew back to safety something else to tell my grandchildren grumbled the iffin shaking himself angrily while peter hastily recovered jacks pumpkin head and put it back where it belonged ill pay him up for that slide come on boys lets try it again can a trick tunnel hold us back now peter looked inquiringly at belfaygor and belfaygor clipping a length from his beard looked doubtfully at peter but jack holding his head with both hands expressed in no uncertain terms his complete unwillingness to ever enter the treacherous tunnel again but we must go on said snif stubbornly if we will just consider well find some simple way to tread this tipsy tunnel and well try it come what may well im not may and i think the way we came was simple enough complained jack i never felt more simple in my life and look at the dent in my head maybe if we run through as fast as we can and get hold of the iron ring in the door before the tunnel tilts we wont spill out suggested peter examining a long scratch on his knee ill go first he volunteered gamely and all of you can hold on to me snif and belfaygor immediately approved of this plan and jack finally not desiring to be left consented to go first peter put snif in his pocket then belfaygor caught hold of peters coattails and jack caught hold of belfaygors taking a long breath peter dashed into the tunnel and never even when he was making a home run had he sprinted along any faster jack and the baron clattering along as best they could behind him just as peter reached the tunnel end and grasped the iron ring the tunnel tipped a second time but peter hung on to the ring and the others hung on to peter several coat seams ripped but when the tunnel finally righted itself they were still inside before it could tilt again peter turned the ring opened the wooden door and stepped into a large cobblestone courtyard straight ahead rose the grim gray walls and buttressed towers of baffleburg as they tiptoed nearer they could hear the sharp ring of horses hoofs on the other side of the wall shall i fly over and see whats going on asked snif fluttering excitedly out of peters pocket no no begged the little boy hurriedly lets all stay together ill ring that bell over the city gates and when the guards carry us to mogodore well open the sack as we planned running forward peter seized the chain attached to a huge bell over the gates and gave it a tremendous pull it was impossible to see into baffleburg as the gates were backed with panels of wood and the walls themselves were high as sky scrapers as the wild clanging of the bell died away the four adventurers drew closer together but nothing at all happened again peter jerked the iron chain but still no one came to open the gates they refuse to admit us puffed belfaygor with a furious clip at his whiskers what now before they had time to decide upon any plan four towers rising from the citys walls suddenly tilted downward and shooting from their tops came a perfect shower of golden spears throwing themselves flat upon the cobbles peter and his companions managed to escape injury time and again the tilting towers rose and fell spraying the courtyard with spears by crawling close to the walls and lying perfectly flat the four adventurers were able to keep out of their way but as peter reflected gloomily they could not lie under the wall forever he was considering whether or not to open the pirates sack and see if it would swallow the spears when belfaygor touched him on the shoulder when the tower nearest me tilts again i shall jump in the window whispered the baron you and jack must follow by keeping directly under the tower you will avoid the spears wait gasped peter horrified at belfaygors daring scheme but belfaygor shaking his head determinedly leaped to his feet and as the tower came tilting down he plunged headfirst into the window nearest to the ground hookamaroosters choked the iffin how did he do that how are we to do it panted peter as all four towers shot up into place again motionless and terrified they waited for them to descend but the baffleburghers evidently deciding that their visitors were utterly routed had turned off the machinery and all four towers stopped tilting there was no possible way into the city now and completely baffled peter stared angrily up at the thick gray walls now ill have to fly over muttered snif nervously maybe i can open the gates a signal called jack suddenly a signal squash and turnip tops its belfaygors beard looking where jack pointed peter and the iffin saw belfaygor himself outlined in the window of the nearest tower and pouring over the sill and growing steadily downward were the wonderful and ever dependable red whiskers we can climb his beard cried peter excitedly come on its almost long enough this was evidently what belfaygor intended for when they looked again they could see him twining his beard round a huge spike on the sill then he waved his hand and peter tightening his belt climbed boldly aloft looking back now and then to call encouragement to jack pumpkinhead in less than a minute they were all safely inside the tower for the iffin had flown up with no trouble at all the tower room was cheerless and without furniture a spiral stairway in the center led downward at the thought of conquering another city peters impatience and excitement grew if only some of the boys could be along or his grandfather he tried to picture belfaygors amazement when the pirates sack should come into action and seizing the barons arm fairly dragged him to the stair i suppose if we go down these steps well come out in the courtyard for this certainly is the fort puffed peter clattering ahead all we do is climb up and down groaned jack pumpkinhead ill bet its a million steps to the bottom oh not that many grinned peter looking down at snif who was comfortably seated on his shoulder quietly cutting his beard belfaygor stepped after peter and jack resignedly brought up at the end of the procession chapter in the castle of mogodore now to get ourselves captured whispered peter eagerly as they finally reached the bottom of the stair it should not be difficult answered snif who had flown ahead and now come back to rest on peters shoulder behold be bold look gaze and tremble stepping out of the dim tower into the courtyard of the fort peter gave a little whistle of consternation and surprise drawn up in glittering rows were a thousand mounted men in armor each holding a golden spear somethings afoot here muttered belfaygor behind his waving whiskers you mean ahorse dont you corrected jack straightening his head and dusting a cobweb off his chin is that sack quite ready peter peter nodded and as one of the armored riders caught sight of the intruders and galloped furiously forward he called boldly conduct us to your chief we have important tidings to impart impart them to me ordered the horseman lifting his visor and frowning down at the little boy impart them to me or ill prick ye over yon wall if you so much as raise your spear ill bite your nose ill chew your ear youll vanish melt and disappear were all magicians do you hear shrieked the iffin flying in dizzy circles about the riders head avaunt varlet rasped belfaygor tossing his beard over his shoulder with a lordly gesture our business is with your master the circling little iffin the strange appearance of jack pumpkinhead and the wildly waving whiskers of belfaygor all tended to bewilder the horseman for a moment he hesitated then galloping back conferred anxiously with one of his companions after much head shaking and arm waving they both rode forward and beckoning for the travellers to follow them trotted briskly under a stone archway that led up to the town itself that was easy chuckled peter trudging gaily after the mailed riders they think were magicians snif well have to be to get out of here muttered the little monster uneasily be careful boy be carefuller than careful every step brings us nearer to the princess said belfaygor tripping over his beard and fixing his eyes hopefully on the castle tower but it was many weary steps to the palace and the one cobbled street of baffleburg was both steep and narrow red stone cottages perched on the cliffs at either side and now and then a curious head was stuck out as the little procession went pounding by but at last they came to the red gates of the castle itself and after a short parley with the guards were admitted leaving their horses in the courtyard the two warriors hustled their charges into the baronial hall of the mountain chief looking around the great hall peter decided that it was just the kind of castle he had always dreamed of owning his eyes shone as they rested on the jewelled swords and armor that decorated the walls but he was quickly brought back to the dangerous business in hand by the stern voice of their guide magicians with an important message to impart announced the first man dipping his spear in a salute to mogodore in full fighting regalia the baron of baffleburg sat at a long table in the center of the hall poring over an old map of oz and trying to decide at what point to attack the capitol back of him stood wagarag in a hastily assembled armor of iron pots and sauce pans next to wagarag lounged bragga captain of the guard and smerker chief scorner of the realm magicians rumbled mogodore looking up impatiently that accounts for them getting into the city magicians eh well they look like a pack of peddlars scorn them he ordered contemptuously jerking his thumb at smerker now peter had never been scorned in his life and wanted to see how it was done so instead of immediately opening the pirates sack he stood staring curiously at smerker leaning forward the chief scorner seized a keylike handle that seemed to be attached to his nose and turned it straight upward at the same time he curled back his lips in a truly astonishing manner ho ha ha roared snif holding on to peter with both claws if this be scorning we are scorned with what a nose he is adorned peter felt like laughing himself but the chief scorner paying no attention at all to the iffin now snatched a sauce box from his sleeve and opening it with a quick jerk held it out toward the travellers immediately the sauce box began to scold and berate them in the most harsh and abusive terms making more noise than a dozen radios and filling the air with such a horrid racket that peter covered his ears and the others without meaning to backed toward the door satisfied that his chief scorner had subdued the intruders mogodore motioned for smerker to close the sauce box now throw them out he barked with a wave at bragga ive wasted too much time already but as bragga stepped forward to obey this command belfaygor snipping a long piece from his beard stepped boldly up to the baron and thumping his fist on the table demanded in a loud voice what have you done with my princess where is shirley sunshine boldened by this spirited action jack pumpkinhead stepped up beside him release this maiden at once you rude rash robber youyou princess snapper he cried have the sack ready quick whispered snif to peter as mogodore stared angrily at the strange pair so thats it grunted the baron of baffleburg i see now that you are belfaygor of bourne hiding like a coward behind false whiskers well you shall not marry this princess for she is to marry memogodore the mighty mighty what inquired jack pumpkinhead curiously mighty mighty you impertinent fool mighty important you ridiculous pumpkin head smite him bellowed the baron with a wrathful wave at jack remove this whiskered pest he roared in the next breath with another wave at belfaygor so youre mogodore the smitey well dont you dare smite me challenged jack shaking his wooden fist under mogodores nose there stands peter the pitcher from philadelphia on his shoulder sits a fabulous monster who may devour you any minute as mogodore rather startled by this long rigamarole half rose in his chair jack vigorously rang the red jinns bell and down upon the table flashed the little black slave set down his tray and vanished mogodores retainers screamed with fright and the baron himself blinked with astonishment but when jack rang the bell a second time biggen and little sprang forward and seized the little slave by the wrists in a twinkling the slave disappeared biggen and little also disappeared you see quavered jack in a slightly unsteady voice i am a great magician then bring back my guards yelled mogodore stamping his foot furiously give back my princess retorted belfaygor just as furiously thinking it about time to put an end to this dangerous discussion peter pulled the pirates sack from his shoulders and was about to unfasten the cord when he was seized suddenly from behind and both arms pinioned closely to his sides this pitchers trying some more magic tricks panted the spearman indignantly he had crept up quietly behind peter and in spite of the little boys struggles mogodores big soldier held him fast we hang pitchers on the wall here boomed mogodore glaring fiercely at peter i regret to say the big baron did not know the difference between picture and pitcher hold that pitcherseize that whiskered rascal and behead that pumpkinheaded dunce enough of this nonsense when i return from the emerald city ill make them produce biggen and little and behead them all promised mogodore striding up and down with a great clash and clatter of armor is princess shirley ready i wait for no man and precious few women i will see your highness touching the iron pot he was wearing for a helmet wagarag hurried from the hall and while peter in helpless rage looked on bragga seized belfaygor the other spearman caught jack and flung him across the center table and unfeelingly struck off his head such was the force of the blow jacks pumpkin bounced to the floor rolled through a tapestrycurtained door and disappeared at this dreadful turn of affairs peter gave a groan and snif almost succeeded in growling but being unable to open the pirates sack they were completely at the mercy of mogodore and his men lock them up on the north tower till my return and know that i will return a king boasted mogodore placing his hand proudly upon the hilt of his sword we march upon the emerald city this very morning ill marry shirley sunshine in the capitol and be crowned king of oz before night fall what gasped peter scarcely believing his ears youll be sorry for this bawled belfaygor slashing with his shears at the captain of the guard poor jack said nothing for without a head what could he say threatening and struggling peter and belfaygor were dragged off to the dungeons in the north tower snif doing what he could to release them by biting and scratching the hands and faces of the guards but he was too little to help much and both were securely locked up in his struggle with the spearman peter had dropped the pirate sack and exhausted and discouraged he sank down on the stone bench in his dark little dungeon the window was high above his head and let in only a feeble ray of light and the stone cell so small he could touch both sides by extending his arms snif had come with him but belfaygor had been locked in a dungeon higher up in the tower things certainly had not gone as plannedin fact they were in worse plight than anyone could have imagined isnt this doggone groaned peter glumly jacks lost his head ive lost the sack and belfaygor will probably smother in whiskers if someone doesnt warn ozma the emerald city will be taken in no time theres only one knight and one soldier in the palace and the soldier cant fight at all if ozma doesnt know mogodore is coming so that she and the wizard can start up their magic theyll all be captured and the whole city destroyed i wonder whatever put the notion of conquering oz in mogodores head darn doggone i wish i could get out of here doubling up his fists peter pounded on the dungeon door maybe i can squeeze through the bars and fly off to warn ozma of this villains coming said the iffin but the bars were so close together that even snif could not slip through and in great discouragement the two prisoners sat side by side on the hard stone bench presently ten shrill blasts from the bugles and the clatter of hoofs on the cobbles below told that mogodore had really started for the emerald city now ill never have any grandchildren choked the iffin a tear trickling off the end of his nose and ill never get back to philadelphia or be an air mail pilot sighed peter clasping his hands behind his head and staring gloomily at the wall and i am sure each of you would have felt gloomy if you had been in peters plight chapter the escape from baffleburg as the rattle of hoofs and sound of bugles died away peter looking down at snif noticed that his eyes were growing larger and larger stop breathed peter nervously edging away and brushing his hand cross his forehead stop what grunted the iffin crossly im not doing anything but your eyes screamed peter edging still further away and your ears why your ears are as big as you are help help look out are you going to explode before snif could touch his ear with his claw or wonder what peter was yelling about he expanded like a balloon filling the entire dungeon and squeezing peter flat against the wall the effect of the shrinking violets had worn off at last and with the iffin rapidly reaching his former size and strength there was not room in the boxlike cell to keep from crushing peter he pressed against the bars of the dungeon the force with which he shot up to his full and former size tore the door from its hinges and bent out the bars like wax while snif stood terrified and trembling with surprise peter with great presence of mind pressed past him slipped through the bent bars and unlocked the dungeon door were free gasped the little boy as snif tumbled head first from their cell were free and youre big and strong again we can fly to the emerald city right away and save ozma and everybody ifievergetmybreath you mean wheezed snif leaning against the wall and puffing like a porpoise whew growing up is almost as bad as shrinking down did it hurt asked peter eyeing his friend with lively curiosity well not exactly explained the iffin raising first one foot and then the other but ive had lots more pleasant experiences did i hurt you not much said peter feeling a bruise on his elbow where he had been pressed against the wall say its great to have you a monster again dont ever eat another violet as long as you live i never will shuddered the iffin shaking his head solemnly out of my way lump pushing over a startled jailer who had run out to see what was the matter snif rushed along the corridor first well find belfaygor then well hunt jacks head and the pirates sack and next well fly to the capitol and put an end to mogodores mischief i can outfly a thousand horses without even trying boasted snif pushing over another guard who darted out to intercept them if id only opened that pirates sack right away puffed peter running to catch up with snif if i only had all this would never have happened goodness whats this good news to me chuckled snif galloping along gaily it is belfaygors beard and will lead us straight to his dungeon snif was right trailing the flowing red whiskers of the baron they came to the topmost cell in the tower out from the dungeon bars poured the enchanted beard of belfaygor belfaygor himself was leaning against the door too discouraged and unhappy to even clip them once but when peter called him by name and he saw snif grown to full size and power again he snapped his shears joyfully and in a trembling voice demanded to know how they had come there we burst our bars cried peter exuberantly at least snif did while the iffin brushed the torrent of whiskers aside the little boy unlocked the dungeon door and after a hearty embrace told the baron all that had happened overjoyed at his release belfaygor followed them down the grim tower corridors each jailer who appeared was scornfully pushed aside by snif and when they came to the bottom belfaygor and peter seated themselves on his back and snif rushed into the great stone hall of the castle the few guards who had been left behind took to their heels as the iffin flew screaming over their heads and with no one to bother them the three began a systematic search for jacks head jacks body still sprawled over the center table the top of his peg neck had been chopped off with his head but whittling another point on the end peter gently dragged the headless figure to a chair and sat him down snif soon found the famous sack behind a screen and remembering jacks pumpkin had rolled through the door peter pushed aside the hanging and tiptoed into a long dim entry it slanted slightly and peter hurried along looking anxiously to the right and left but the pumpkin head was nowhere to be seen the hallway was growing narrower every minute curving round and round like a spiral slideway and leading continuously downward peter was about to go back and call the others when the moist nose of snif appeared round one of the curves back of him whats this demanded the iffin and whither doth it lead i dont know said peter but jacks head must have rolled down here and be lying somewhere at the bottom then let us join it by all means chuckled the iffin sitting down and sliding calmly after peter look out here i come and take this pirates sack will you it makes me positively shudder peter reached back and relieved snif of the sack above they could hear belfaygor treading cautiously down the hallway but the curved passage soon grew so steep peter and snif began to slip roll and finally coast like children on a playground slide now youve done it coughed the iffin as they finally somersaulted into a dark cellarway lit by one feeble lantern out of one dungeon into another but theres jacks head cried peter picking himself up joyfully the sudden arrival of belfaygor immediately knocked him down again but while the baron mumbled apologies peter sprang to his feet and hurrying over to the corner of the cellar pounced upon jacks pumpkin oh jack weve been so worried about you said the little boy holding the head tightly in both arms but now well soon fix you up and fly to the emerald city for snif has grown big again and weve all escaped from the tower so i see observed jack as peter held his head toward the others and im very glad they chopped off my head and not yours peter for yours would not so easily be put back and its lucky they did chop it off too for otherwise i would never have learned of the forbidden flagon forbidden flagon exclaimed peter sitting down on an overturned keg and staring earnestly down at jacks head what has that to do with us everything confided jack mysteriously has mogodore started for the emerald city peter nodded and snif and belfaygor both drew nearer while the little boy explained how they had escaped and how they were now about to fly to the capitol to warn ozma of mogodores wicked intentions but we must not go without that flagon insisted jack after listening attentively to peters recital listen as i was lying here a while ago hoping that no rats would come to gnaw my fine features or make a nest in my head an armed guard came creeping up that ladder you see over in the darkest corner as he did another came sliding down from above and stopping under the lantern they began to converse what a bitter waste of time it is guarding this foolish flagon fumed the guard who had climbed the ladder who ever could find their way to the enchanted cavern through the lost labyrinth anyway only one as knows the tricks grinned the fellow who had come down to relieve him left turn left and always left and as for the enchanted cavern itself bah what a joke but have you heard the latest news doab mogodore has gone to capture the emerald city and make himself a king a king roared the second ha ha tis well those foolish folk at the capitol know nothing of this flask one tip of that forbidden flagon and what demanded peter who had been listening breathlessly to jacks story well admitted the pumpkinhead regretfully he didnt say but from the nudge he gave his comrade i imagine theres something in that flask to destroy mogodores power but we have the sack and the wizard and ozma have plenty of magic objected peter impatiently i dont think wed better stop to hunt for it jack we had better go on to the emerald city just as fast as we can we had the sack before and mogodore captured us dont forget that sighed the pumpkinhead gloomily whats happened before may easily happen again it will not take longer than an hour to fly to the capitol and mogodore riding at his best speed cannot reach there until afternoon perhaps we had better find this flagon peter and make sure of victory this time murmured snif thoughtfully and as belfaygor sided with the iffin peter rather reluctantly agreed to descend into the enchanted cavern we may lose our way in the labyrinth said peter looking down the ladder without much enthusiasm not while i have my whiskers smiled belfaygor stroking his famous beard well let them grow along with us and then well follow them back if it werent for those whiskers wed never be here hurrah for your beard three hurrahs and a cheer roared snif saluting the baron with his front paw not so loud not so loud begged belfaygor looking around nervously someone might hear you do you want to come with us asked peter looking doubtfully at the pumpkinhead better leave me here advised jack seriously youll need both hands to fight the guard now dont forget when you are in the labyrinth turn left and keep turning left and youre sure youll be all right asked peter placing jacks head gently on the cellar floor i certainly cannot be all right if im left but id rather be left than right this time muttered jack to himself as his three friends disappeared down the ladder into the labyrinth chapter the enchanted cavern this is about as exciting as rice pudding without any raisins said peter treading closely after snif for five minutes they had been trudging solemnly through the labyrinth at the foot of the ladder every few rods the chilly tunnel would branch off into three or more tunnels but belfaygor always taking the left turn marched hopefully onward his red beard trailing like a long and lively vine behind him are you sure weve been turning left all the time asked peter after five more minutes of this weary winding we dont seem to be getting anywhere at all belfaygor nodded emphatically and taking another left turn gave a sharp exclamation of surprise and dismay coming quickly around the bend peter and snif saw that they had reached the enchanted cavern itself horrors shuddered peter catching hold of snifs mane youre right wheezed the iffin rearing up on his hind legs open the sack open the sack these are worse than scares the enchanted cavern was small and dim and lit only by a flickering red light but ranged around the walls was such a company of ugly muglies that peters fingers fumbling with the strings of the pirates sack shook so he could hardly untie the knots he finally did get the cord unfastened and opening the sack he advanced a step into the cave as he did the ugly muglies advanced a step toward him and in a panic peter realized that the sack was not going to swallow them belfaygor turning to run tripped over his whiskers and fell flat peter looked round desperately for a rock or stone to fight with but snif muttering dreadful denunciations in the grif language hurled himself bodily at the enemy there was a dull thud as snif met the enemy and next instant he lay stretched on the floor peter was almost afraid to look but forced himself to move forward come away begged the little boy in a hoarse whisper trying at the same time to tug the iffin to his feet hurry hurry here they come again again moaned snif opening one eye they were never there at all but i see them insisted peter what knocked you down instead of answering snif lurched to his feet myself panted the iffin planting his claw in the middle of a red monsters nose the walls of this cave are mirrors boy magic mirrors they multiplied us fifty times and in fifty frightful ways theres nobody here but us rubbing his eyes peter looked again then tiptoeing forward touched the walls of the cavern just as snif said they were mirrors and remembering how he had often laughed at his distorted reflection in the mirror maze at willow grove peter began to laugh now no wonder the sack wouldnt work said peter jerking the cords tight and tossing the sack over his shoulder but its a pretty good trick at that look at me im enough to frighten my own grandfather oh come on grumbled belfaygor who was vexed to think he had been so easily scared lets find this miserable flagon and begone its stifling in here the scowling reflections cast by the mirrors were so confusing they had to go slowly and carefully but after circling the cavern several times they discovered an opening into a still smaller cave peter went first and poking his head under the arch between the caves saw the guard jack had mentioned asleep beside a fountain of fire the fire fountain jetted up from the center of a deep green grotto and in the middle of the fountain peter could just make out a small black flagon with a little cry of triumph he darted into the rocky room youll burn yourself puffed belfaygor as peter leaned forward to snatch the flagon from the flames at his cry of warning the guard awakened and with spear upraised sprang to his feet but belfaygor was ready for him seizing his spear belfaygor ran round and round the startled soldier till he was wound up like a mummy in the barons red beard calmly cutting off his end of the whiskers belfaygor dragged the helpless guard out of the way let us get this flagon and depart cried the baron maybe this fire isnt real suggested peter maybe its a trick like the mirrors taking a piece of paper from his pocket peter tossed it into the fountain but it caught fire at once and burned up with such a snap and crackle the three friends jumped back in a hurry i dont mind singeing a few feathers for the cause said snif as peter and belfaygor looked longingly at the strange black flask no you dont said peter firmly youve done your share with a little smile he touched the lump snif had raised on his head when he ran into the walls of the cave you discovered the mirrors belfaygor captured the guard now its my turn while snif grumbled his disapproval and the baron stroked his beard uneasily peter gazed into the sparkling fountain of fire then with a sudden snap of his fingers he seized belfaygors shears and clipped a long piece from the barons red and ever ready whiskers now said peter you take one end and ill take the other looking much mystified belfaygor did as he was told they were standing back of the fire fountain and one on each side at a signal from peter both rushed forward the barons beard passing through the flames knocked the flagon from its stand before it went up in smoke and the flagon itself rolled into a dark corner of the green grotto wait till it cools off warned peter as snif made a pounce at the flask illustration _the flagon rolled into a dark corner of the grotto_ gee i do wonder whats in it and why its hidden down here impatiently they looked down at the smoking black bottle and after what seemed to be hours peter covering his hand with his handkerchief ventured to pick it up it was still smoking hot but by changing hands frequently peter managed to hold it and read aloud the curious legend on the red label the forbidden flagon to be guarded by each successive baron of baffleburg who breaks the seal upon this flask or spills its contents red brings woe to baffleburg and dire disaster on his head now thats nice said the iffin wiggling his nose very fast we break the flask to subdue mogodore and bring a disaster on our own heads dont drop it lad whatever you do dont drop it id like to have a few more geraniums and see a few more sunsets before a disaster hits me it is my place to break the seal announced belfaygor in a determined voice give me the flagon what care i for disaster if shirley sunshine is saved peter was really alarmed at the threatening tone of the red verses not now belfaygor wait till we reach the emerald city and then maybe we wont have to break it at all thats the talk said snif waving his tail gently to and fro come lets start back peter tucked the flagon into his pocket well go right away he said leaving the guard still swathed in whiskers the three friends stepped from the small cavern into the large cavern and from the large cavern into the labyrinth going back they turned right and kept turning right but it was slow and tedious and seemed much longer than before at last dusty and weary they came to the end and climbed the ladder into the cellarway thank the stars youre here cried jacks pumpkinhead not the stars wheezed snif heaving himself up the ladder and dropping heavily on the cellar floor not stars whiskers they lead us down they lead us back they tied the guard up fast they pulled the flagon from the flames long may they wave and last they have been pretty useful admitted belfaygor giving his beard a thoughtful stroke before he cut it off short useful rumbled the iffin raising one claw theyre wonderful im positively attached to them not half so much as i am smiled the baron with another quick clip so you found the flagon said jack as peter picked up his head and started up the long steep slideway peter nodded and with what breath he had left told jack all about the enchanted cavern and the inscription on the magic flask there was a rail beside the slide and by holding on to this they managed to pull themselves up without slipping backward but they were now so impatient to be off that the slide seemed simply endless finally they reached the top and hurried down the hallway leading into mogodores room of state heres somebody youll be glad to see chuckled peter pointing to the stiff figure seated in the chair some body exclaimed jacks head as peter held it up why its mine reunite us at once my boy oh how i have missed me it was the matter of but a moment to place the pumpkin head back on its peg at once jack arose to his feet and executed a lively jig in which the iffin with more gusto than grace joined him while peter and the baron looked amusedly on the search for the flagon had taken just an hour and feeling well repaid for their trouble the four valorous rescuers prepared to leave the palace jack took out the famous dinner bell to see that it was safe belfaygor gave his beard a last cheerful clip snif ate the tops of a pot of geraniums and peter putting the flagon in his pocket and tightening his hold on the pirates sack felt ready for any adventure but as he prepared to jump upon snifs back there came a sudden splutter screech and roar stop screamed a threatening voice stop or you shall be boiled like eggs stewed like prunes fried like fish snif swallowed a geranium whole jacks knees knocked together and bent outward and in spite of himself peter clutched at a chair for support who speaks boomed belfaygor snatching a sword from the wall and swinging about like a teetootum die thundered the voice again die you knaves trembling a little peter looked all around but could see no one as the dreadful threats kept up belfaygor went to look behind a screen but one of mogodores hunting dogs rising from its place by the fire moved majestically across the floor picked up a small red box in its teeth and with an impatient grunt dropped it at peters feet then with a satisfied yawn the great dog rubbed against his knee and returning to its post immediately dozed off again its the sauce box cried peter with a gasp of relief closing the lid he smiled cheerfully at the iffin id like to smash its lid grunted snif vindictively i nearly choked on that geranium dont do that advised jack leaning down to straighten his knee joints take it along what frightened us may easily frighten others thats so laughed peter helping jack to mount snifs back well we surely have enough magic now a dinner bell a forbidden flagon a magic sack and a sauce box dont forget belfaygors beard said snif slyly as peter climbed up behind jack i wish i could forget it sighed the baron seating himself next to peter oh well peter reminded him cheerfully it wont be very long now belfaygor no not if he keeps cutting it said jack calmly i mean it wont be long before we reach the emerald city laughed peter as the iffin raised his mighty wings and swooped out the wide open castle doors here we go chapter high times in swing city as soon as we see mogodore ill open the pirates sack no fooling declared peter looking down at the whirling red landscape like tiny toys under a christmas tree the villages and towns spread out below and some country people dancing about a may pole looked no larger than dolls swallowings too good for him objected belfaygor stroking the sword he had taken from the castle hall let me have one good swing at himone good thrust before you open that sack if we trust to a thrust we may all be undone tis better to sack him than whack him my son called snif looking over his shoulder to wink at peter much better approved jack pumpkinhead let us open the sack break the forbidden flagon and throw the sauce box at his head yes and bring a dire disaster on our own said peter remembering the warning on the magic flask well give the flagon to ozma and let the wizard of oz decide what is to be done with it well i hope he can do something with my beard groaned belfaygor looking ruefully at the blisters on his thumbs i cannot keep on cutting it forever besides it will frighten the princess hell fix it promised peter confidently the wizard of oz can fix anything oh boy i can hardly wait to see them all again is scraps as funny as ever and has kuma party visited the emerald city since i left he lent ozma a hand just the other day said jack throwing both arms around snifs neck as he made a sudden dive through a cloud she was having trouble with the hammerheads and needed a strong hand to subdue them peter had met kuma party on his first journey to oz this singular gentleman can really send his hands feet head or body wheresoever he wishes belfaygor listened politely as peter told how kumas hand had guided him to the kingdom of patch helped him escape and how it had afterward arrived at the emerald city in time to catch the gnome king if we had it now we could send it down for some apples sighed the little boy peering hungrily over the iffins wing snif was flying low to be sure not to miss mogodore and the orchards laden with rosy red fruit looked tempting indeed why not order lunch asked jack as peter continued to gaze longingly at the apples eat as you fly why not chuckled belfaygor slipping his shears into the pocket of his coat i could make some food fly right now as peter was wondering just how they would manage the trays jack rang and up beside the iffin flashed the faithful slave of the bell but he did not carry the tray this time it was borne by biggen mogodores bodyguard and the great fellow trod clumsily through the air his eyes rolling with fright and fury at a haughty gesture from the slave he set the tray on peters lap then raising his fist he was about to pound peter on the head when the little black seized him by the coattails and both disappeared whew whistled peter ducking his head what do you think of that look out here comes the other one as jack rang the bell again little just as angry as biggen came hurling toward them with the barons dinner the slave winked mischievously at peter as the enraged bodyguard placed the tray on belfaygors knees then catching the surly fellow by the ear he vanished before little could do any harm good enough roared snif who had witnessed the whole proceeding over his shoulder what sweet little sprites they do make if mogodore could see them skipping lightly through the sky hed shiver in his great red boots and shake like custard pie thats what we have for dessert said peter lifting the cover off his tray say its too bad you dont eat pie snif or roast guinea murmured belfaygor between rapturous bites ill give you three horses and a couple of hunting dogs for that bell peter peter smiled to himself for he could not help thinking how crowded three horses and a dog would make the small back yard at home but he tactfully said nothing for he had decided to present the magic dinner bell to ozma enjoying the red jinns delicious dinner looking dreamily down at the lovely mountain scenery beneath peter concluded that this was even more exciting and interesting than eating on the train i shall think nothing of airplane trips after this mused the little boy sipping his chocolate complacently i dont believe anything could ever surprise or frighten me again not even a highwayman finishing off his pie peter closed his eyes and was fighting an imaginary duel with a mexican bandit when he was suddenly seized by the shoulders jerked from the iffins back and hurled like a ball through the air his first thought was that biggen returning for the magic tray had taken this means of revenge but there was no sign of either bodyguard in spite of his recent boast peters heart beat with dreadful thumps as he turned over and over in the air but just as he gave himself up for lost he was skillfully caught by the ankles howdedo called a pleasant voice and looking up peter saw a jolly fellow in silk tights swinging by his heels from a high trapeze he wore a crown which was held in place by ribbons tied beneath his chin now hanging head down if you are not accustomed to it is terribly upsetting and peter was too upset to say a word welcome to swing city said this strange sovereign in his high jolly voice i am the king and the highest swinger here in fact hiswingers my name he coughed selfconsciously but you must meet the queen tip toppsy the tenth as he said meet the queen hiswinger flung peter carelessly downward any desire peter had ever had to do circus stunts he lost in that second dizzy drop through space fortunately he did meet the queen somewhere in mid air like the king she was hanging head down from another swing and grasping both of peters wrists swung him gently to and fro isnt he perfectly precious cooed her highness smiling amiably down at the little boy i hope hell stay with us always what lovely hair what sweet red cheeks hell make a perfectly splendid swinger highty now if there was one thing peter detested it was being fussed over and the queens speech made him squirm with embarrassment and rage but before he could do more than mutter tip toppsy swung him back to her husband shall we dress him in pink or blue she called anxiously blue answered the king catching peter and drawing him up close so he could look into his eyes but my dear see whats coming now who is this pomiferous person throwing peter carelessly aside the king caught jack pumpkinhead who had just been tossed up by someone below peter himself was seized by a smiling trapezist some twenty feet beneath before the fellow could throw him further peter pulled himself desperately up on the trapeze and holding tight to the side rope stared dizzily around over his head and under his feet pink and blue clad figures swooped and darted like birds with lightning speed they shot from swing to swing skipped recklessly across spidery ropes and balanced perilously on swaying cords trapleased to meet you murmured the owner of the trapeze swinging up beside peter hang around a while youll like it tis an easy life we leadtrapeasy he added with a sly wink have you met the queen yes yes shuddered peter moving as far from the tumbler as he could im looking for my friends is that one of them inquired the acrobat pointing off toward the left ha ha ha the tight rope walkers will never let that fellow go they are great cutups you know great cutups why look at his beard its growing longer every minute they can cut rope after tight rope from it ha ha ha rope after rope no they cant shouted peter angrily and youd better be careful were wizards and will destroy you like that letting go of the side rope with one hand peter snapped his fingers sharply will you said the trapezist in an interested voice then that means a battle an acrobattle hello its begun already look at that old nibblywog down there come on were missing all the fun jerking peter from the swing the acrobat hurled him to the next trapeze and the next and the next until everything turned topsyturvy peter could no more have opened the pirates sack than he could have counted the somersaults he took in the air jack had long since lost his head and peter could see the acrobats tossing it about like a ball below that a troupe of tightrope walkers were dancing merrily on belfaygors beard which had been stretched between two swings the baron himself was held fast by a dozen swing citizens and snif trying to help first peter then belfaygor was buffetted and banged with the hard fists of the aerialists how dare you hold us up in this high handed manner roared the iffin nearly beside himself with rage and indignation there is no telling how long peter and his friends would have been tossed about had not a sudden shake dislodged mogodores sauce box from the little boys pocket opening as it fell it immediately filled the air with such a thunder of screams threats and brazen screeches several swing citizens lost their hold upon the swings and fell trembling through space magic squealed hiswinger clutching his crown with both hands drop them drop them at once so peter and his companions were dropped as suddenly as they had been taken up by these fickle folk of the air and with sickening speed went whizzing downward peter was too dizzy to realize he was falling again and snif trying to catch all of them at once succeeded only in rescuing jacks head as it whirled past but he need not have worried for under this strange city a great net was suspended and into this net they all landed with a bounce that promptly sent them skyward again score one for the sauce box panted peter as he fell back geewhizi never want to see another swing as long as i live neither do i muttered belfaygor unwinding himself from his long red whiskers and feeling for his shears snif said nothing for he was trying to hold jacks body steady and place his pumpkin back on its peg peter hastened to assist him and soon jack was himself again ups and downs he mused sadly nothing but ups and downs and how are we to get out of this net may i ask ill cut a hole in the net and well drop through said belfaygor promptly its not far to the ground another fall groaned jack holding his head with both hands oh think of something else if we stay here said the iffin the swingers will probably come back and if we dont hurry well miss that rascally baron and hell capture the emerald city before we catch him ill fall quavered jack crawling toward the opening belfaygor was cutting in the net ill do anything for ozma weve certainly done a lot of falling for her so far sighed peter scrambling after jack let me fall first and then i can help you holding for a moment to the edge of the opening peter dropped lightly to the ground then reaching up he caught jack under the arms and carefully eased him down belfaygor quickly followed jack and snif bounced through in short order well weve lost the sauce box and a lot of time but weve met a new and curious kind of people said peter pulling down his jacket and so did they smiled the iffin giving himself a shake and examining two places where he had lost some fur a hurried search proved that the magic bell the sack and flagon were still in their possession jack was no worse for his swinging and though snif peter and belfaygor still felt dizzy and shaken by their unexpected experiences in swing city they decided not to stop and rest but to push straight on for the capitol from now on said snif gravely we must keep a sharp look out for trouble ill watch the air said jack seating himself quickly ill watch the ground promised peter springing up briskly behind him and ill see that were not followed said belfaygor climbing on last of all then off we go rumbled snif what a lot i shall have to tell my grandchildren if i ever have any grandchildren i hope theyll be just like you peter he added with an affectionate glance over his shoulder peter smiled faintly to himself for he did not see how this could be but he was too polite to argue the question and fixing his eyes upon the road below looked eagerly for some sign of mogodore and his men chapter peter opens the pirates sack what a curious existence mused belfaygor as snif came to the end of swing citys net and soared joyfully into the air well everybody has his own idea of comfort but as for me i prefer a castle with someone to serve the soup and bring on the venison snipping off his beard the baron gave a homesick sigh and looked glumly at the tiny farms and villages below a place where a fellow can keep his feet on the ground and his head on his shoulders suits me declared jack in a weary voice ive never lost my head so often as on this trip did you see those savages using it for a ball they used my beard for a tight rope said belfaygor in an exasperated voice so what could you expect and they called snif a nibblywog laughed peter and threw me around like an old shoe all they need to make them monkeys is tails dont insult a monkey said snif looking reprovingly over his wing ive known some polite monkeys in my day but those highwaymen snif gave a disgusted grunt ive a notion to fly back and settle with them after this other affair is all over i hope we didnt miss mogodore while we were being held up there worried peter it must be nearly four oclock now and we certainly ought to overtake him soon are you sure we are flying in the right direction snif yes said the iffin expertly circling a dark cloud why there he is now flapping both wings violently together snif pointed with his claw there coming out of that forestmogodore and all his men see the sun shining on their spears with a swoop that nearly unseated his riders the iffin hurled himself over the wood and the next instant they were hanging motionless over a tossing sea of spears the princess cried belfaygor leaning far over theres shirley sunshine riding out ahead fly lower snif fly lower and well snatch her up and be off no we wont muttered the iffin grimly well open the sack and catch this kingdom stealer first open the sack peter open the sack theres no one to stop you now so intent upon their purpose were the warriors below they never saw the red monster above their heads now peter had untied the pirate sack now it was ready to open seizing snifs wing to balance himself peter stood up in order to hold the sack directly over the enemy as he did a great gust of wind tore the sack from his hands filled it full of air and sent it spinning up like a balloon high above their heads oh choked the little boy nearly losing his hold on snif nothing ever happens right doggone that sack anyway the flagon screamed jack throw the flagon quick before he gets away ill do it whispered belfaygor eagerly give it to me peter quick tugging the forbidden flagon from his pocket peter was about to pass it to the baron when a hoarse scream from the iffin made him pause the sack panted the red monster flapping his wings desperately its coming straight for us look look look out look up hold on if that comes nearer we are gone jack took one startled glance upward and then instead of holding on snatched the flagon from peters hand and dove recklessly to earth as he did and as the last of mogodores army galloped out of dangers way the wretched sack its mouth wide open came hurling down upon the rescuers jack had been wise to jump before peter or the baron could follow him they were snapped up i mean down an earsplitting growl came to jack as he turned over and over in the air the fright of vanishing had restored snifs gurrr and it was a real griffin not an iffin who disappeared into the fathomless depths of the pirates grab bag then floating calmly to the ground the terrible sack settled calmly against a pink hay stack and was still not far away jack lay face down on another soft mound of pink hay so tightly had he held to his head and the flagon he lost neither during the fall and the hay had saved both from smashing but when jack rolled over and started to rise he found that his left leg had bent under and broken off at the knee being of wood jack suffered no pain but it was frightfully inconvenient and it was now impossible for him to walk or even hobble shaking his fists as the last of mogodores riders disappeared in a cloud of dust jack sank dejectedly against the hay mound and tried to collect his scattered thoughts his purpose in plunging from the iffins back had been to break the flagon over mogodores head and save the emerald city at any cost even if he himself were destroyed but now it was too late mogodore was gone peter snif and belfaygor had vanished and he himself was a broken man the wicked baron of baffleburg with none to stop him would march boldly to the capitol fall upon its unsuspecting inhabitants enslave them all and seize the magic treasures for himself this dark picture fairly made jack groan and when he spied the magic sack resting against the next hay stack he positively shuddered all that is left of three faithful friends mourned jack i hope theres room for belfaygors beard in that bag or theyll all be smothered i hope theyre not mixed with scares i must get that sack whatever happens i must get that sack and take it to the wizard of oz at thought of touching the enchanted bag jack shook like a tree in a hail storm but controlling his fear and distaste he dragged himself to the haystack first he pulled the cords that closed the top then hanging it carefully over one shoulder dragged himself back his broken leg and the forbidden flagon lay side by side in the straw and raising his voice jack shouted loudly for help but the pink hay field was a long way from the farm house and no one heard him except a few curious crows who answered his cries with dismal screeches finally jack grew so hoarse he could shout no more and holding his head in both hands he tried to think of some way to reach the emerald city if the scarecrow were only here sighed jack dolefully he would be sure to hit upon some clever plan but i am only a poor stupid pumpkin head with only a few dried seeds for brains realizing that the whole fate of the kingdom of oz depended upon him poor jack pressed his head with his wooden hands and thought so hard that the seeds inside skipped about like corn in a corn popper and one must have been a seed of thought for presently jack gave a little bounce and feeling in his pocket drew out the red jinns bell ill make that slave help me muttered jack determinedly just how the slave could help him jack did not stop to figure out but anything was better than sitting foolishly on a haystack while little ozma was facing capture and possible banishment so jack tucked his broken leg under one arm tightened his hold on the pirates sack put the precious flagon in his coat pocket and boldly rang the silver bell i hope he does not bring those meddlesome bodyguards muttered jack leaning forward anxiously the slave of the ball appeared so promptly this time that his tray almost hit jack in the nose placing the tray on jacks lap the little fellow backed away and was preparing to vanish when jack sprang to his feet and scattering dishes in every direction seized the small servitor by the arm stop cried jack pumpkinhead desperately stop you must help me but jack might as well have tried to stop the wind with a shrill cry the red jinns slave vanished jack also vanished now there was no one in the pink hay field at all only a pink rabbit who wiggled his nose anxiously and then began nibbling at a stalk of celery that had fallen from the magic tray chapter in the palace of the red jinn in about three whirls and one spiral jack found himself on the steps of a glittering red glass palace it stood on the edge of a green glass sea whose waves broke with a melodious tinkle and crash on the beach below the beach itself was a gleaming stretch of glass splinters most dangerous to the tread of unwary travellers jack was so confounded by his sudden arrival in this strange place that for several moments he was scarcely aware that the slave of the bell was addressing him be pleased to enter the castle of the red jinn murmured the little black boy politely repeating the words till jack at last did hear him is the owner of this palace also the owner of the magic dinner bell asked jack uneasily the slave nodded brightly and after an inquisitive glance at jacks broken leg which he still carried under his arm he offered his shoulder to jack with his assistance jack began hopping doubtfully upward there were nearly a hundred steps and moving up and down was a vast and colorful company of turbaned gentlemen who might have stepped directly from the arabian nights as each one passed he took off his slipper and tapped jack smartly on the head what what have i done stuttered jack trying to protect his head with his arm why do they strike me and why do they smile as they do it it is the custom in this country to take off the right shoe and tap a visitor upon the head as a polite method of salutation and greeting explained the slave calmly greeting groaned jack ducking back to avoid another slipper waver well if we meet many more of your countrymen my head will be a squash instead of a pumpkin why cant they shake hands like we do in oz every country has its own customs answered the slave stiffly why do you wear such a soft head pray because im accustomed to it replied jack a little sulkily its the kind of head that goes with my kind of person a turban would help observed the slave as another citizen greeted jack boisterously with his slipper i dont need a turban said jack hopping desperately up the last step but i do need help my friends have disappeared into an enchanted sack and my country is in danger of destruction i must have help do you think your master is powerful enough to help me it depends on how you strike him murmured the slave indifferently there he is now you might ask him the glass doors of the palace were wide open and jack looked anxiously into the great red glass throne room the doorways and arches were hung with strands of strung glass triangles and the musical tinkle of these strange curtains was both pleasant and delicate all of the furnishings were of sparkling red glass and a double line of tall vases led directly to the throne a strange drowsy incense rose in pink clouds to the ceiling at first jack thought the jinn was merely another vase but as with the black boys aid he hopped nearer he saw that the vaselike figure on the throne had legs crossed on the spun glass cushions and hands clasped round his fat and shiny middle no head was visible nothing but a lid with a round knob on the top a sleepy black wielded a great fan drowsily over this portly person and jack after pausing uncertainly took the leg he still carried under his arm and tapped the jinn sharply on the lid instantly it raised up and from the vaselike interior of this strange sovereign rose an enormous red head with an exceedingly pleasant round face he blinked curiously at jack and then turning to the slave wheezed good naturedly well well ginger my boy what have you brought me this time i am delighted that our bell was stolen it keeps us in touch with the outside world and has already got us two extra slaves but this one is the best yet he looked jack up and then down i havent been so amused in a thousand years dont you want the bell back asked jack holding it out uneasily he had expected the jinn to be very angry at the holder of his magic treasure no no keep it and welcome just to look at you is worth a hundred dinner bells said the jinn smothering a chuckle behind his fat hand an odd enough appearing gentleman ginger is he not and so polite where we but remove the slipper he has taken off the entire leg to do us honor tell me who and what are you most curious sir you struck him exactly right whispered the slave encouragingly speak up and he may help you i am jack pumpkinhead your majesty said jack balancing himself with great difficulty and a simple citizen of oz i believe you puffed the jinn and forthwith broke into such a series of strange sounds that jack drew back in dismay what language is that he asked in a faint voice i do not seem to understand your majestys remarks the red jinns lid which he wore quite jauntily for a hat was still quivering but controlling himself with a great effort he wiped his face on a red silk hanky tis the laugh language jack he confided with a wink at the little slave the ha ha and ho ho of great merriment do you not speak this language in your country fellow the guffaw and the snicker the giggle and roar of pure hilarity ho ho you are doing me good great good come join me in a little roar and well speak the laugh language in all its branches but i do not feel like laughing said jack wearily i have lost my best friends and will lose my country too if your highness does not help me are you very powerful are you important enough to help me terribly important answered the jinn pursing up his lips at least to myself he nudged the slave of the bell who nodded delightedly and jack without further parley held up the pirates sack in this bag said jack solemnly are a little boy a baron and a flying red monster no murmured the jinn leaning forward incredulously how did they get in the bag how will they get out again and if they stay in an age will they become baggage ha ha ho ho the red jinns mirth was extremely distressing to poor jack but feeling that everything depended upon the wizards help he smothered his resentment and patiently told the whole story of his adventures since peters arrival in oz as he proceeded the jinns expression grew more sober and at the conclusion of the story he clapped his hands sharply immediately jacks broken leg snapped back into place and with a surprised skip jack began marching up and down that is the first step toward helping you smiled the jinn holding up his hand to silence jacks outburst of gratitude now we must find a way to send you to oz release the prisoners from the sack and break the forbidden flagon without disaster to yourself my magic lookingglass would show us where your friends are but not how to rescue them my magic umbrella would carry you to oz but i need that myself let me think let me think wrinkling his brows the red jinn retired into himself and shut the lid will he come out again asked jack turning nervously to the little slave the slave nodded impressively so jack fixing his eyes earnestly on the jinns red lid waited for him to reappear and presently his head popped up and with snapping eyes he leaned forward first he whispered nine words in jacks carved ear and next eight more then leaning back he regarded jack with a pleased and satisfied smile now all we have to do is to arrange for your journey to oz said the jinn tapping his fingers upon the arm of his glass throne i believe ill send you off in my jinrickasha would you like that why hes gone shouted ginger leaping into the air gone vanished departed so he has spluttered the jinn lurching forward and rubbing his eyes with astonishment was it by your majestys magic queried the slave of the bell breathlessly not by my majestys magic but some other meddlesome magic hash and horseradish now i shall never hear the end of the story pulling in his head so suddenly that the lid came down with a crash the red jinn dropped back on his cushions and the little slave having experienced the extreme of his masters temper when disappointed tiptoed hurriedly from the royal presence what had become of our hero who had spirited jack pumpkinhead away from the palace of the red jinn chapter the capture of the emerald city in that delightful hour before dinner when it is too early to go in and light the lamps and too late to go for another picnic or swim it is a pleasant custom in ozmas palace to gather in the garden for games almost any fine evening at dusk if you were to peep over the wall of the green castle you would see all the celebrities and most of the courtiers playing hop scotch or prisoners base the ruler of oz as most of you know is a little girl fairy and ozma is quite as fond of fun and good times as you are dorothy betsy and trot ozmas best friends and advisers are little girls too so that life in the emerald city is bound to be interesting and gay and how could it be otherwise with so many unusual and amusing people living in the palace the scarecrow spends most of his time there though he has a splendid residence of his own and for fun and good comradeship there is no one like this jolly strawstuffed gentleman he was lifted from a pole and brought to the emerald city by dorothy on her first journey to oz dorothy herself was blown to oz in a cyclone and has had so much fun and so many adventures that she would not think of living anywhere else betsy and trot are from the united states too but prefer life in the emerald city to life in america as indeed i should myself almost everybody has heard of tik tok the copper man tik tok is not alive but very lively and when properly wound can walk talk and run as well as anybody justly famous is the tin woodman whole books have been written about him for nick chopper is emperor of the winkies and almost any child in oz can tell you the strange story of nick and the enchanted ax that chopped off his arms and legs severed his trunk and finally chopped off his head after each accident nick had himself repaired by a tin smith till he was entirely a man of tin and like the scarecrow he spends more than half his time in the capitol then we must not forget sir hokus a real knight who was rescued after seven centuries of imprisonment in pokes now where but in oz could a knight last for seven centuries and be so spry so bold and so full of interesting stories where but in oz could one find a wizard able to whisk one about with magic wishing pills and conjure up ozcream and popovers by a mere puff of magic powder another prime favorite in the palace is scraps made from an old patchwork quilt and magically brought to life scraps adds a touch of fun and gaiety to all the palace parties for scraps is wholly without dignity and can think up verses faster than little boys can think up excuses the soldier with the green whiskers is a fine fellow too he is the whole grand army of oz and though not very brave has such a splendid uniform and long shining green beard just to look at him gives one pleasure and satisfaction recently a live statue and a medicine man have come to ozmas court the medicine mans chest is a real medicine chest full of helpful remedies and although no one in the emerald city ever falls ill ozma has graciously conferred upon herby the title of court doctor add to all of these famous characters the cowardly lion the hungry tiger and a dozen other strange pets fifty or more splendid courtiers and servants and you will have a fair idea of the merry company romping in the garden on this early evening in may dorothy had just won an exciting foot race and sinking into a green hammock called gaily to the scarecrow lets play blindmans buff and blindfold everyone but betsy bobbin then well all try to find her and first one who does shall have three pieces of strawberry short cake a lot of good that will do me sighed the scarecrow patting his straw stuffed stomach but if i win you shall have my cake dorothy youll never win teased betsy beginning to hop up and down with impatience none of you will remember now wizard no fair using magic to find me havent a bit of magic with me my black bags inside laughed the little wizard of oz fitting a big green handkerchief around his head in less than a minute ozma and everyone in the garden was blindfolded even the cowardly lion had dorothys hair ribbon tied securely over his eyes all ready called betsy and tiptoeing over to an enormous butterfly bush she climbed into the center and sat still as a mouse but the others were very far from still with shouts screams and little roars of merriment they ran to and fro bumping into each other and throwing their arms around trees and statues and making so much noise that they never heard the tramp of feet on the other side of the wall for mogodore had at last arrived in the emerald city and with a rush and without opposition captured the famous fairy capitol at sight of his spearmen the peaceful inhabitants fled into their houses and slammed windows and doors unk nunkie a brave old munchkin who had started on a run to warn the people in the palace was caught by bragga tied up securely and carelessly tossed into a greenberry bush shirley sunshine who had leaped from her horse for the very same reason was overtaken and put under guard illustration _with shouts screams and little roars of merriment they ran to and fro_ a fine way to help muttered mogodore shaking his finger at her accusingly what were you about princess i was anxious to see the castle stuttered poor shirley twisting her handkerchief miserably youll see it soon enough promised mogodore just wait till ive conquered this silly little fairy about forty paces from the castle itself mogodore dismounted and called a council of war leaving five hundred men to hold the city he took five hundred with him to storm the palace and overcome the famous celebrities whom he had read about so often shirley sunshine was left behind until the fighting should be over mogodore and his five hundred picked soldiers marched boldly upon the castle high time for a new king here sniffed mogodore scornfully a city without defenses no army no guards what can they expect but capture there may be an army inside the castle walls warned wagarag jogging wearily along at the barons elbow before we rush the gates we had better look about a bit and see that everything is safe very good grunted mogodore taking a pinch of snuff you and i will go forward the others may remain here my spear tossed into the air will be the signal for them to advance it was a short walk to the walls of the palace and hoisting himself with great gasps and puffs the baron of baffleburg raised his head cautiously over the top of the wall and looked down into the royal gardens what he saw astonished him exceedingly and with a soundless chuckle he dropped to the ground the silly dunces are playing a game whispered mogodore to his trembling steward theyre blindfolded and all we have to do is to jump over the wall and seize them tossing his spear into the air mogodore waited impatiently for his men and when they came hurrying forward he raised his hand for silence drop over the wall one at a time join in this game of blindmans buff each man take one prisoner and tie him to the nearest tree when all are taken i will march into the palace seize the crown jewels and magic belt and proclaim myself king of oz all ready with only a slight scraping of boots on the stones mogodore and his men slipped over the wall and into the garden betsy bobbin sitting breathlessly in the center of the butterfly bush became suddenly aware of a change in the gay uproar around her the joyous shouts and good natured exclamations turned to frightened screams and indignant protests and finally to loud shouts for help what can have happened gasped betsy poking her head out of the bush what she saw as you can well imagine made her sink back in a faint heap the garden was swarming with armed warriors and ozma and all of her friends and courtiers were tied to the trees with gold chains and struggling in vain to free themselves i am the only one left panted betsy i must try to slip out unnoticed and get the magic belt in this famous belt as most of you know there is such power that the wearer can transform anyone to any shape at all ill turn them to old shoes and door knobs sobbed betsy with another frightened peek out of the bush the chances of her reaching the palace were slim indeed and finally she gave up all hope but she could not help feeling proud of the way ozma of oz was conducting herself what does this mean demanded the little fairy tearing the bandage from her eyes and stamping her foot as well as she could with so many chains around her ankles who are you and what do you want release us at once or my wizard and my army will destroy you ho ho ho roared mogodore looking cheerfully down at the furious princess hand over the keys of the castle my dear for you are completely conquered and absolutely captured i mogodore the mighty and baron of baffleburg am the future king of oz ill crown you with my fist sputtered sir hokus tugging at his chains till the tree he was tied to rocked as if by a tempest ill thump thee on the bean sir hokus has picked up a lot of slang from trot and betsy bobbin and mixes it fluently with his knightly conversation well change you to a fritter well fry you in a pan you rude uncultured critter do you call yourself a man yelled scraps defiantly and all the other celebrities joined their voices to hers till the din was so dreadful that even betsy had to cover her ears but it had no effect upon mogodore quite calmly he continued to gaze down at ozma and the longer he looked the broader grew his ugly grin a little beauty he mumbled half to himself prettier far than this shirley sunshine i shall marry princess ozma he shouted suddenly clapping wagarag so heartily upon the back that the poor stewards iron pot helmet fell over one eye into the palace fellow and prepare a feast for the wedding farewell for the moment slaves illustration _a little beauty he mumbled far prettier than shirley sunshine_ shaking his spear at the furiously struggling ozites mogodore tramped off to the palace followed by two hundred and fifty of his men the others he left to watch the prisoners and betsy continued to crouch uncomfortably in the butterfly bush as the baron of baffleburg strode into the castle ozma began to speak quietly and comfortingly to her people for the moment sighed the little sovereign sadly we are overpowered and at the mercy of these rude ruffians but let us be patient and brave and surely some help will come to us i hope there will be no shooting quavered the soldier with the green whiskers trembling so his chains rattled dismally if i only had my black bag fumed the wizard trying desperately to free himself from the screams and crashes indoors the anxious company in the garden knew that the servants were being overpowered presently a long file of them came out between two lines of mogodores men who marched them to a small summer house and carefully locked them in i hope they dont find the magic belt breathed dorothy wriggling into a more comfortable position and trying to smile reassuringly at the scarecrow who was tied to the next tree but even while dorothy was hoping out dashed mogodore waving the belt his helmet had been removed and ozmas small emerald crown perched ridiculously upon the top of his head i beg that your majesty will be careful cried wagarag running anxiously after the excited baron remember that belt is very powerful very dangerous have a care i havent a care in the world shouted mogodore fastening the belt round his arm for it would not begin to go round his waist am i not a king and about to marry a fairy go play marbles waggy and let me alone i am a king and if i choose can destroy this entire country and then as wagarag continued to plead and beg him to be cautious he yelled angrily go attend to the feast you meddlesome weasel and leave this magic to me i shall test the powers of this belt at once do you know that i can transform anyone here to anything i wish begone before i turn you to a bone and throw you to the dogs now indeed did the helpless oz folk tremble and as wagarag shaking his head sadly backed away from his foolish master mogodore began to look around the garden for someone to transform perhaps because the patchwork girl was the oddest and most amazing person he had ever seen his eye rested longest upon her i command this ridiculous maiden to become a bird called mogodore in a loud voice and instantly scraps was a bird an exceedingly scrappy bird too wildly flapping her patchwork wings she quickly disengaged herself from the gold chains that bound her to the tree then swooping down upon mogodore she snatched ozmas crown from his head and hurled herself into the air quick quick change her back i knew youd do something silly groaned wagarag as mogodore stared dumbly upward now shell fly off and spread the alarm you bet i will screeched the patchwork bird and with an earsplitting screech she soared over the castle and disappeared i told you something would happen whispered ozma smiling quietly at dorothy now if mogodore had been more practiced in magic he would instantly have changed scraps into a stone and she would have dropped heavily and helplessly to earth but utterly confused and mortified by the unfortunate outcome of his first transformation the baron pushed his steward furiously aside rushed into the castle and slammed both gold doors chapter mogodore meets more magic soon the fragrance of an appetizing repast began to float out to the unhappy prisoners in the garden dusk turned to darkness lights shone from every room in the palace and in dreadful suspense and discomfort they waited for mogodores next move that robber baron really means to marry you groaned trot who was tied to a tree near ozma and as if to confirm her words two spearmen came marching determinedly toward them her majesty queen ozma is wanted within bawled the first man looking around ozma of oz this way please immediately the little fairy was released from her chains never mind she whispered as trot burst into tears remember scraps is free and will find a way to help us shed better hurry shivered dorothy and with sinking hearts they all saw their little leader marched away between the guards wellfilled plates were being brought out to the soldiers in the garden but no refreshment of any kind was offered to the prisoners nor did betsy bobbin crouched in the center of the butterfly bush find any opportunity to escape from her hiding place inside a great feast was laid in the banquet hall and the rude warriors were already seated and banging on the table with their gold forks and knives wagarag an apron tied hastily over his armor was supervising the festivities and mogodore seated at the head of the table without even rising waved ozma to a place beside him with a little sigh of despair ozma slipped into the green throne chair your future lady in waiting grunted mogodore pointing rudely to shirley sunshine who sat on his other side i did truly intend to marry this princess but find you so much more charming i have chosen you instead hurrah for the queen of oz and baffleburg yelled the spearmen boisterously shirley under cover of the rattling knives and forks tried to whisper her story to ozma but mogodores loud roars for food soon put an end to that and pale with distaste and fright the two little princesses sat silent scarcely touching a mouthful of the food that was unceremoniously dumped upon their plates with a shudder ozma looked around her tidy castle mud had been tracked over all the velvet rugs pictures hung sideways and the floor was strewn with broken vases and plates that spearmen playfully hurled at one another between courses if scraps succeeded in reaching the castle of glinda the good sorceress who ruled over the south ozma knew this powerful ally would immediately fly to her assistance with agonized ears she listened for the wings of glindas swan chariot but time went on and no one came now that the hunger of the rough company was appeased they grew more noisy than ever call this a battle wheezed bragga to mogodore are there to be no hangings no bon fires no killings of any kind you promised us a real war this is as tame as a taffy pull tugging discontentedly at his long mustache the captain of the guard looked sulkily at his chief after the wedding you may kill whom you please promised mogodore indifferently but now im going to have another try at that magic belt take care take care bleated wagarag from the other end of the banquet hall ill wager youre thinking of that forbidden flagon again right boomed the baron sweeping a dozen plates to the floor with his arm and right now im going to transport that flagon to this castle and find out what is in it and why it is forbidden what will happen if the seal is broken it cannot harm me now i am no longer baron of baffleburg but king of ozking by right of seizure and conquest youll not be the lawful king till you marry this princess quavered wagarag raising a trembling finger and pointing to ozma the old bone is right grumbled bragga why not marry her now and be done with it marry her now echoed all the spearmen and let us get on with the killing pushing back her chair ozma jumped up and glanced desperately around the table would no one save her from this robber baron and his band mogodore too rose to his feet im king now i tell you he insisted stubbornly and ill marry when im ready but now i am going to end the miserable mystery of the forbidden flagon i command the forbidden flagon and its guard to appear before me bellowed mogodore staring around defiantly scarcely had the sound of his voice died away before there came a crash and splinter of glass and in through a window back of the baron burst a strange flying figure it was jack pumpkinhead clasping the precious flagon in one hand and holding to his head with the other brought all the way from the red jinns palace by the mysterious power of the magic belt with a hysterical little cry ozma rushed forward jack jack panted ozma have you come to save us solemnly jack nodded and before a man at the table could move he whisked off his head set it on a chair and then and not till then did he hurl the forbidden flagon straight at the baron of baffleburg how he ever managed to aim so true without his head to help him i have no idea but with a resounding crack the flagon splintered to bits on mogodores nose and a thin red liquid began to pour down his cheeks and drop off his chin no longer need mogodore wonder what would happen when the seal on the forbidden flask was broken for what would happen had happened stars yes chapter the forbidden flagon acts the great banquet hall seemed suddenly deserted and except for faint squeaks and muffled screams quite silent shirley sunshine hurrying around the table clasped ozmas hands and both girls stared in stunned silence at jack who was calmly replacing his head why where have they gone cried ozma then all at once she saw for tumbling from the chairs scurrying under tables and vainly trying to hide themselves was a host of men no bigger than brownies theyre shrunk shouted jack delightedly ha there mogodore the mighty mighty little you are now fuming and raging the midget baron tried to quiet his frightened retainers but when toto dorothys little dog came bounding through the doorway he fled ignominiously and hid behind the hearth broom good dog toto drive them in the corner approved jack and toto much as a shepherd dog chases sheep drove the terrified horde of invaders into a corner and gravely sat down to watch them snapping at any who tried to escape and snuffing at one and then another most curiously it was the forbidden flagon explained jack as ozma dropped into a chair and looked in complete bewilderment at the brownie baron and his band is anyone hurt did i come in time yes yes sighed ozma pushing back her tumbled curls but how did you know where have you been jack dear where havent i been puffed jack pumpkinhead striding excitedly up and down say whats that noise where is everybody oh cried ozma jumping up hurriedly the others are in the garden we must free them at once but before shirley sunshine ozma or jack were halfway to the door it burst open and the whole company of courtiers and celebrities came charging into the banquet hall surrender villains bellowed sir hokus glaring around furiously where is that braggart baron well pull his nose well tweak his ears glinda the good has come shes here exulted scraps shaking her cotton fists joyfully for she had been immediately restored to her own cheerful self by the good sorceress of the south glinda in her lovely red robes and headdress peered sternly over scraps shoulder ready to bring her strongest magic into play seeing no one in the room but ozma jack and shirley sunshine they all stopped short then catching sight of mogodore and his midgets cowering in the corner they surged forward in still greater astonishment what happened demanded dorothy seizing ozmas hands the spearmen in the garden suddenly disappeared scraps reached glindas castle and glinda came and released us but whatever happened in here how did that monster grow so tiny perhaps jack can tell you sighed ozma who was as puzzled as anyone over the curious occurrences of the last few minutes i can announced jack stepping forward importantly but it is a long long story then do lets sit down groaned trot for she was mortally tired from the long stand in the garden are we saved quavered the cowardly lion as the stiff and weary company fell into the chairs so recently vacated by the conquerors of oz jack nodded emphatically then i will attend to the prisoners boomed the soldier with the green whiskers springing out from behind a pillar and very brave since the enemy had been reduced striding over to the corner he stood over the disconsolate warriors his gun sternly pointed downward now betsy picked up the magic belt from the floor where it had fallen when mogodore shrunk and fastened it thankfully round ozmas waist scraps set the emerald crown upon her curly head and with great gentleness and ceremony the scarecrow and tin woodman conducted the little ruler to her rightful place at the head of the table then the scarecrow ran out to release the servants who were locked up in the summer house the wizard ran to see if his black bag was safe trot wound up tik tok who was completely run down by his terrible experiences and everybody settled back expectantly to hear what jack pumpkinhead had to say now tell us exactly what happened begged betsy bobbin as the scarecrow and all the servants came marching into the dining hall and the wizard tightly clutching his black bag slipped into a seat beside dorothy well said jack with a dignified little cough before i begin to tell you that there is something i must do and three brave comrades to be released from an enchantment the advice of my friend the red jinn worked once and i shall therefore try it again before he speaks he must act chuckled the scarecrow who had completely recovered his good humor well my boy actions speak louder than words leaning on both elbows the scarecrow looked on with great interest as jack snatched the pirate sack from his shoulder turned it inside out and gave it three quick shakes chapter the wedding feast is it a nightmare shivered betsy clutching trots arm or a halloween party am i really here and are they and well might she ask for the last shake of the pirates sack had filled the room with fraid cats and scares screaming groaning snatching at one another and the oz folk the scares swarmed this way and that until the confusion was terrible actions speak louder than words mumbled the scarecrow well i do not like their actions at all call these comrades friend jack help begone away with you jumping up the scarecrow waved his napkin wildly around his head and all the others hastily pushing back their chairs rushed to the assistance of ozma who was completely surrounded by the ugly intruders jack pumpkinhead was so stunned and startled by this unexpected happening that he stood perfectly still then resolved to go through with the matter he shook the sack three times more and this time with the desired result why its peter roared sir hokus disentangling himself from ten scares and hurrying over to the little boy who had just tumbled out of the sack peter the pitcherand thumping scares both left and right the good knight looked doubtfully at the iffin and belfaygor who had rolled out of the bag after peter himself who are these muttered sir hokus making ready to whack the great red monster if it showed signs of attack dont mind us begged the iffin glaring around the banquet hall keep working keep working ill help you and help he did with teeth tail and claw where am i how did i get here how did they get here muttered peter rubbing his eyes dizzily and trying to collect himself for he remembered nothing since he had been swallowed by the sack but he soon recovered and fighting his way through the frenzied crowd till he reached ozmas side cried excitedly theyre scares your highness quick send them back to scare city before they break everything to pieces glinda and the wizard had already started an incantation to rid the castle of the horrible horde but before it was half spoken ozma without waiting for peter to explain arose and in a slightly trembling voice called i command these people and creatures to return to scare city at once and at once and all together they did and now straightening their collars and settling their ties for the encounter had been rough and furious the oz folk gazed at peter and his comrades as curiously as they had gazed upon their pigmy conquerors and the unlovely citizens of scare city if someone will just explain said ozma everythings so terribly mixed up if someone doesnt explain i shall burst declared betsy bobbin bouncing out of her chair have you come back to stay peter dear and who are these others peter was a bit breathless and confused himself and looked anxiously around for the baron but belfaygor had slipped off unnoticed with shirley sunshine well this began peter placing his hand on the red monsters head this is snif an iffin i mean a griffin if snifs an iffin or a griffin i spose at us hell soon be sniffin ventured scraps putting her finger in the corner of her mouth if i should snif at folks so kind id be most rude and unrefined replied the iffin with a wink at the patchwork girl and this little exchange of verses relieved the strain that the whole company had been under shall i tell the story or will you whispered jack pumpkinhead stepping closer to peter you begged peter staring with round eyes at mogodore and his little men theyve been eating shrinking violets muttered the iffin rubbing his eyes with one paw and staring even harder than peter no it was the flagon explained jack the forbidden flagon reduced them to midgets but what became of belfaygors beard it disappeared into the magic sack grinned belfaygor coming into the room at that moment with the little princess on his arm and glad i am that its gone ill never wear another beard as long as i live beard put in the soldier with the green whiskers eagerly did you have a beard as long and splendid as mine did i groaned the baron rolling his eyes to the ceiling ask peter taking another look at the soldier with green whiskers he shuddered and turned away you remind me of something im trying to forget said belfaygor now all of this only served to increase the interest and curiosity of the already curious company tell us tell us cried dorothy impatiently so after belfaygor and shirley sunshine had been properly introduced jack pumpkinhead began the strange story of their journey from scare city to baffleburg and from baffleburg to swing city and his own transportation to the capitol and while he spoke the footmen and other servants moved quietly about sweeping up broken glass clearing away the table and removing all traces of the rude barons short reign in the palace guarded over by toto and the soldier with green whiskers mogodore and his men crouched miserably together wondering what would become of them being merciless themselves they expected no mercy from their captors in small hoarse voices they berated mogodore for meddling with the forbidden flagon and bitterly denounced him for the terrible misfortune that had overtaken them the rest of the midgets had been discovered and marched in from the garden and soon after word had been sent out through the city that the baron was captured unc nunkie and his nephew ojo arrived driving the rest of the barons tiny warriors and horses before them so that the entire army were now rounded up in the corner of the banquet hall but so intent was the company upon jacks amazing story they scarcely heard the grumbling and complaining of the little men or the frightened neighs of the toysize steeds in the kitchen another banquet was soon under way more and more candles were lighted and soon the castle began to reflect its old time cheer and friendliness little gasps and exclamations of astonishment punctuated jacks recital and he had to tell over and over how they had escaped from baffleburg how snif had dwindled down when he ate the shrinking violet how belfaygors enchanted beard had helped them out of difficulty and how the mischievous pirate sack had swallowed three of the company when they were needed most of all peter belfaygor and snif were as interested as the others in jacks visit to the red jinn and in the advice that jolly wizard had given you remember the label on the forbidden flagon said that whoever broke the seal would bring a disaster upon his own head said jack turning to his comrades peter and the baron both nodded and snif waved his tail to show he remembered too well smiled jack the red jinn told me to remove my head before throwing the flagon and thus avoid the disaster so thats why you took off your pumpkin murmured ozma who had been puzzled by this strange action of jacks and he also told me that to release the prisoners from the pirate sack i must turn it inside out and shake it three times went on jack impressively so when mogodore transported me suddenly to the palace i did both of these things you certainly did agreed the scarecrow shaking his finger at jack pumpkinhead and brought a horde of horrors about our ears i forgot about the scares admitted jack apologetically but theyre back where they belong now and everything has turned out for the best it certainly has exclaimed ozma jumping up impulsively you and peter snif and this brave baron have saved the kingdom of oz jack was so overcome by these words that he lost his balance and sat down but he was quickly pulled to his feet and next instant the rafters rang with rousing cheers for the four valiant rescuers i wish my grandchildren could hear this sighed the iffin resting his chin on one claw oh have you grandchildren asked ozma leaning forward politely no murmured the iffin in an embarrassed voice but i may have and theyll be interested to hear about this take my advice and never have any grandchildren whispered the scarecrow confidentially im a grandfather and i know before he had time to explain what he meant two footmen came grandly forward to announce that dinner was ready and no one i assure you was sorry for that i know what to do cried dorothy as the green coated servitors began marching in with trays of savory meats and vegetables let this be a wedding feast for belfaygor and shirley sunshine hurrah for a wedding feast shouted the iffin grrrah forgetting he had recovered his growl the red monster let out such a terrific roar that the cowardly lion swooned away and had to be revived with a jug of cider but he soon recovered and a wedding feast it was and fit for a royal bride i do assure you snif had eight geranium plants and an easter lily and was happier than he had ever been in his whole fabulous existence never in the history of oz was there a merrier banquet nor a happier crowd delighted to have peter with them again the oz folk forgot their recent capture and had such a time as only those dear and delightful folk can have jack pumpkinhead insisted upon being lit up for the celebration so he was snif and scraps kept the company in gales of laughter with their rollicking rhymes and when the wedding was solemnized by the highest judge in ozmas court belfaygor and his bride were toasted in tall tumblers of ozade and simply showered with emeralds and quickly gathered gifts of every sort and description what did it feel like to disappear into that sack asked trot in a little pause following the wedding well once said peter fixing his eyes thoughtfully on the iffin once i had a tooth pulled and took gas it was like that trot i just went out thats all at once the others began to recall their own experiences with vanishings and disappearances and not till daybreak did any one think of retiring then the baron of baffleburg and his grumbling little army were locked up in the pantry for safety and peter snuggling down in his emerald studded bed decided that this adventure was even more exciting than the last one i wish i could take snif back to philadelphia with me sighed the little boy as he finally dozed off to sleep chapter peters return to philadelphia next day the festivities continued and all day long peters old chums and acquaintances were calling at the palace while the celebrities outdid one another to make things pleasant for belfaygor and his bride at noon they rode off on the saw horse for the baron was anxious to return to his castle peter bade the baron goodbye and promised to pay him a long visit on his next trip to oz to ride the horse belfaygor agreed to keep for him and even wear the armor the baron had promised him as a reward for rescuing the princess snif spent a happy morning in the royal stable with the famous beasts of oz and they listened so politely to his experiences he decided to stay on indefinitely at the capitol the pirates sack was locked up in the wizards strong box and the magic dinner bell stored with the other treasures of the realm for as ozma remarked to dorothy it would be mighty handy for picnics and unexpected visitors the fraid cats and statues in scare city were released from their enchantment by the wizards long distance magic and peter and snif looking in the magic picture had the satisfaction of watching them return to their various homes the only thing that still puzzles me sighed ozma as they all sat cozily under the trees in the garden late that afternoon the only thing that puzzles me is the forbidden flagon what strange spell could have reduced mogodore and his followers to midgets i think i can explain that answered glinda setting her tea cup down on a small green table when scraps flew to my castle yesterday and told of the capture of the emerald city i at once turned to my magic record book to discover something about this baron of baffleburg you are all i am sure familiar with brownies dorothy and betsy bobbin nodded sagely and all the others quickly inclined their heads well said glinda with a wave toward the south in the red mountains of oz there are large bands of reddies who are quite similar to brownies except for the color of their coats which are red to one of these tribes mogodore and his men really belong but mogodores great grandfather jair was a brave and determined little reddy whose good deeds and brave actions greatly exceeded his size and strength so long ago a neighboring wizard whom jair had done a great service rewarded jair by making him and his followers as large in size as they were in deeds and in action but the enchantment only held so long as the mysterious red liquid remained in the forbidden flagon mogodores father and grandfather guarded the flagon well but mogodore knew nothing of its secret power nor of his own ancestry or origin being by nature discontented and greedy he was always puzzling about the strange black flask and at the first opportunity he satisfied his curiosity well its a good thing he did said peter looking thoughtfully at the little band of captives who were being marched up and down one of the garden paths by the soldier with green whiskers now the other barons will have a little peace lets keep them for toys proposed scraps who was never weary of watching the tiny army no said ozma shaking her head at the patchwork girl that would be cruel has their city grown small too glinda the sorceress smiled and nodded then i shall send them back to baffleburg declared ozma for they are now too small to harm anyone and there they will be safe and comfortable as everyone heartily approved of this plan ozma touched her magic belt spoke the few words necessary and away whisked the bad little baron and his band to their tiny red city on the rocks just the same i wish we could have kept him sighed scraps to dorothy he looks so funny when hes mad hush whispered dorothy for peter had risen and in an embarrassed voice was asking ozma to send him back to philadelphia still like baseball better than oz rumbled sir hokus shaking a teasing finger at peter well admitted the little boy blushing a bit at the question the fellows sorta depend on me hokus and then you know theres my grandfather of course smiled ozma of course there is goodbye dear peter come back soon and as often as you will goodbye sobbed the iffin overcome at the thought of losing his chum if you were my own grandchild i couldnt love you any better goodbye called jack pumpkinhead and scraps and all the others and before their gay voices had quite died away peter was standing in the dim library of his own house oh grandfather cried peter ive been to oz again and flying is grand grandfather then we must try it some time observed the old gentleman calmly and saying nothing at all about peters strange absence oh may we peter dropped on the arm of the big chair may we really well why not demanded grandfather glancing around the room belligerently and letting his specs fall the full length of the black cord why not tis a free country and flyings no crime hurrah shouted peter bouncing off the chair arm and right that instant he decided that even in oz there was no better chum nor braver adventurer than this grandfather of his so straightway he told him all that had happened in baffleburg and other placesindeed all of this story that i have just told to you

terrible combat began a man a shipwrecked sailor i cried the _nautilus_ was floating near a mountain the _nautilus_ was blocked up one of these long arms glided through the opening the unfortunate vessel sank more rapidly part one chapter i a shifting reef the year was signalised by a remarkable incident a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon which doubtless no one has yet forgotten not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind even in the interior of continents seafaring men were particularly excited merchants common sailors captains of vessels skippers both of europe and america naval officers of all countries and the governments of several states on the two continents were deeply interested in the matter for some time past vessels had been met by an enormous thing a long object spindleshaped occasionally phosphorescent and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale the facts relating to this apparition entered in various logbooks agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question the untiring rapidity of its movements its surprising power of locomotion and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed if it was a cetacean it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers timesrejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in lengthwe might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the ichthyologists of the day if it existed at all and that it _did_ exist was an undeniable fact and with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition as to classing it in the list of fables the idea was out of the question on the th of july the steamer _governor higginson_ of the calcutta and burnach steam navigation company had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of australia captain baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water projected by the inexplicable object shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air now unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser the _governor higginson_ had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal unknown till then which threw up from its blowholes columns of water mixed with air and vapour similar facts were observed on the rd of july in the same year in the pacific ocean by the _columbus_ of the west india and pacific steam navigation company but this extraordinary cetaceous creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity as in an interval of three days the _governor higginson_ and the _columbus_ had observed it at two different points of the chart separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues fifteen days later two thousand miles farther off the _helvetia_ of the compagnienationale and the _shannon_ of the royal mail steamship company sailing to windward in that portion of the atlantic lying between the united states and europe respectively signalled the monster to each other in n lat and w long in these simultaneous observations they thought themselves justified in estimating the minimum length of the mammal at more than three hundred and fifty feet as the _shannon_ and _helvetia_ were of smaller dimensions than it though they measured three hundred feet over all now the largest whales those which frequent those parts of the sea round the aleutian kulammak and umgullich islands have never exceeded the length of sixty yards if they attain that these reports arriving one after the other with fresh observations made on board the transatlantic ship _pereire_ a collision which occurred between the _etna_ of the inman line and the monster a _procès verbal_ directed by the officers of the french frigate _normandie_ a very accurate survey made by the staff of commodore fitzjames on board the _lord clyde_ greatly influenced public opinion lightthinking people jested upon the phenomenon but grave practical countries such as england america and germany treated the matter more seriously in every place of great resort the monster was the fashion they sang of it in the cafés ridiculed it in the papers and represented it on the stage all kinds of stories were circulated regarding it there appeared in the papers caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary creature from the white whale the terrible moby dick of hyperborean regions to the immense kraken whose tentacles could entangle a ship of five hundred tons and hurry it into the abyss of the ocean the legends of ancient times were even resuscitated and the opinions of aristotle and pliny revived who admitted the existence of these monsters as well as the norwegian tales of bishop pontoppidan the accounts of paul heggede and last of all the reports of mr harrington whose good faith no one could suspect who affirmed that being on board the _castillan_ in he had seen this enormous serpent which had never until that time frequented any other seas but those of the ancient _constitutionnel_ then burst forth the interminable controversy between the credulous and the incredulous in the societies of savants and the scientific journals the question of the monster inflamed all minds editors of scientific journals quarrelling with believers in the supernatural spilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign some even drawing blood for from the seaserpent they came to direct personalities for six months war was waged with various fortune in the leading articles of the geographical institution of brazil the royal academy of science of berlin the british association the smithsonian institution of washington in the discussions of the indian archipelago of the cosmos of the abbé moigno in the mittheilungen of petermann in the scientific chronicles of the great journals of france and other countries the cheaper journals replied keenly and with inexhaustible zest these satirical writers parodied a remark of linnæus quoted by the adversaries of the monster maintaining that nature did not make fools and adjured their contemporaries not to give the lie to nature by admitting the existence of krakens seaserpents moby dicks and other lucubrations of delirious sailors at length an article in a wellknown satirical journal by a favourite contributor the chief of the staff settled the monster like hippolytus giving it the deathblow amidst an universal burst of laughter wit had conquered science during the first months of the year the question seemed buried never to revive when new facts were brought before the public it was then no longer a scientific problem to be solved but a real danger seriously to be avoided the question took quite another shape the monster became a small island a rock a reef but a reef of indefinite and shifting proportions on the th of march the _moravian_ of the montreal ocean company finding herself during the night in lat and long struck on her starboard quarter a rock marked in no chart for that part of the sea under the combined efforts of the wind and its four hundred horsepower it was going at the rate of thirteen knots had it not been for the superior strength of the hull of the _moravian_ she would have been broken by the shock and gone down with the passengers she was bringing home from canada the accident happened about five oclock in the morning as the day was breaking the officers of the quarterdeck hurried to the afterpart of the vessel they examined the sea with the most scrupulous attention they saw nothing but a strong eddy about three cables length distant as if the surface had been violently agitated the bearings of the place were taken exactly and the _moravian_ continued its route without apparent damage had it struck on a submerged rock or on an enormous wreck they could not tell but on examination of the ships bottom when undergoing repairs it was found that part of her keel was broken this fact so grave in itself might perhaps have been forgotten like many others if three weeks after it had not been reenacted under similar circumstances but thanks to the nationality of the victim of the shock thanks to the reputation of the company to which the vessel belonged the circumstance became extensively circulated the th of april the sea being beautiful the breeze favourable the _scotia_ of the cunard companys line found herself in long and lat she was going at the speed of thirteen knots and a half at seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon whilst the passengers were assembled at lunch in the great saloon a slight shock was felt on the hull of the _scotia_ on her quarter a little aft of the portpaddle the _scotia_ had not struck but she had been struck and seemingly by something rather sharp and penetrating than blunt the shock had been so slight that no one had been alarmed had it not been for the shouts of the carpenters watch who rushed on to the bridge exclaiming we are sinking we are sinking at first the passengers were much frightened but captain anderson hastened to reassure them the danger could not be imminent the _scotia_ divided into seven compartments by strong partitions could brave with impunity any leak captain anderson went down immediately into the hold he found that the sea was pouring into the fifth compartment and the rapidity of the influx proved that the force of the water was considerable fortunately this compartment did not hold the boilers or the fires would have been immediately extinguished captain anderson ordered the engines to be stopped at once and one of the men went down to ascertain the extent of the injury some minutes afterwards they discovered the existence of a large hole of two yards in diameter in the ships bottom such a leak could not be stopped and the _scotia_ her paddles half submerged was obliged to continue her course she was then three hundred miles from cape clear and after three days delay which caused great uneasiness in liverpool she entered the basin of the company the engineers visited the _scotia_ which was put in dry dock they could scarcely believe it possible at two yards and a half below watermark was a regular rent in the form of an isosceles triangle the broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly defined that it could not have been more neatly done by a punch it was clear then that the instrument producing the perforation was not of a common stamp and after having been driven with prodigious strength and piercing an iron plate inches thick had withdrawn itself by a retrograde motion truly inexplicable such was the last fact which resulted in exciting once more the torrent of public opinion from this moment all unlucky casualties which could not be otherwise accounted for were put down to the monster upon this imaginary creature rested the responsibility of all these shipwrecks which unfortunately were considerable for of three thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded at lloyds the number of sailing and steam ships supposed to be totally lost from the absence of all news amounted to not less than two hundred now it was the monster who justly or unjustly was accused of their disappearance and thanks to it communication between the different continents became more and more dangerous the public demanded peremptorily that the seas should at any price be relieved from this formidable cetacean chapter ii pro and con at the period when these events took place i had just returned from a scientific research in the disagreeable territory of nebraska in the united states in virtue of my office as assistant professor in the museum of natural history in paris the french government had attached me to that expedition after six months in nebraska i arrived in new york towards the end of march laden with a precious collection my departure for france was fixed for the first days in may meanwhile i was occupying myself in classifying my mineralogical botanical and zoological riches when the accident happened to the _scotia_ i was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day how could i be otherwise i had read and reread all the american and european papers without being any nearer a conclusion this mystery puzzled me under the impossibility of forming an opinion i jumped from one extreme to the other that there really was something could not be doubted and the incredulous were invited to put their finger on the wound of the _scotia_ on my arrival at new york the question was at its height the hypothesis of the floating island and the unapproachable sandbank supported by minds little competent to form a judgment was abandoned and indeed unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach how could it change its position with such astonishing rapidity from the same cause the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck was given up there remained then only two possible solutions of the question which created two distinct parties on one side those who were for a monster of colossal strength on the other those who were for a submarine vessel of enormous motive power but this last hypothesis plausible as it was could not stand against inquiries made in both worlds that a private gentleman should have such a machine at his command was not likely where when and how was it built and how could its construction have been kept secret certainly a government might possess such a destructive machine and in these disastrous times when the ingenuity of man has multiplied the power of weapons of war it was possible that without the knowledge of others a state might try to work such a formidable engine after the chassepots came the torpedoes after the torpedoes the submarine rams thenthe reaction at least i hope so but the hypothesis of a war machine fell before the declaration of governments as public interest was in question and transatlantic communications suffered their veracity could not be doubted but how admit that the construction of this submarine boat had escaped the public eye for a private gentleman to keep the secret under such circumstances would be very difficult and for a state whose every act is persistently watched by powerful rivals certainly impossible after inquiries made in england france russia prussia spain italy and america even in turkey the hypothesis of a submarine monitor was definitely rejected upon my arrival in new york several persons did me the honour of consulting me on the phenomenon in question i had published in france a work in quarto in two volumes entitled mysteries of the great submarine grounds this book highly approved of in the learned world gained for me a special reputation in this rather obscure branch of natural history my advice was asked as long as i could deny the reality of the fact i confined myself to a decided negative but soon finding myself driven into a corner i was obliged to explain myself categorically and even the honourable pierre aronnax professor in the museum of paris was called upon by the _new york herald_ to express a definite opinion of some sort i did something i spoke for want of power to hold my tongue i discussed the question in all its forms politically and scientifically and i give here an extract from a carefullystudied article which i published in the number of the th of april it ran as follows after examining one by one the different hypotheses rejecting all other suggestions it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a marine animal of enormous power the great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us soundings cannot reach them what passes in those remote depthswhat beings live or can live twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the waterswhat is the organisation of these animals we can scarcely conjecture however the solution of the problem submitted to me may modify the form of the dilemma either we do know all the varieties of beings which people our planet or we do not if we do _not_ know them allif nature has still secrets in ichthyology for us nothing is more conformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes or cetaceans of other kinds or even of new species of an organisation formed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings and which an accident of some sort either fatastical or capricious has brought at long intervals to the upper level of the ocean if on the contrary we _do_ know all living kinds we must necessarily seek for the animal in question amongst those marine beings already classed and in that case i should be disposed to admit the existence of a gigantic narwhal the common narwhal or unicorn of the sea often attains a length of sixty feet increase its size fivefold or tenfold give it strength proportionate to its size lengthen its destructive weapons and you obtain the animal required it will have the proportions determined by the officers of the _shannon_ the instrument required by the perforation of the _scotia_ and the power necessary to pierce the hull of the steamer indeed the narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory sword a halberd according to the expression of certain naturalists the principal tusk has the hardness of steel some of these tusks have been found buried in the bodies of whales which the unicorn always attacks with success others have been drawn out not without trouble from the bottoms of ships which they had pierced through and through as a gimlet pierces a barrel the museum of the faculty of medicine of paris possesses one of these defensive weapons two yards and a quarter in length and fifteen inches in diameter at the base very well suppose this weapon to be six times stronger and the animal ten times more powerful launch it at the rate of twenty miles an hour and you obtain a shock capable of producing the catastrophe required until further information therefore i shall maintain it to be a seaunicorn of colossal dimensions armed not with a halberd but with a real spur as the armoured frigates or the rams of war whose massiveness and motive power it would possess at the same time thus may this puzzling phenomenon be explained unless there be something over and above all that one has ever conjectured seen perceived or experienced which is just within the bounds of possibility these last words were cowardly on my part but up to a certain point i wished to shelter my dignity as professor and not give too much cause for laughter to the americans who laugh well when they do laugh i reserved for myself a way of escape in effect however i admitted the existence of the monster my article was warmly discussed which procured it a high reputation it rallied round it a certain number of partisans the solution it proposed gave at least full liberty to the imagination the human mind delights in grand conceptions of supernatural beings and the sea is precisely their best vehicle the only medium through which these giants against which terrestrial animals such as elephants or rhinoceroses are as nothing can be produced or developed the industrial and commercial papers treated the question chiefly from this point of view the _shipping and mercantile gazette_ the _lloyds list_ the _packetboat_ and the _maritime and colonial review_ all papers devoted to insurance companies which threatened to raise their rates of premium were unanimous on this point public opinion had been pronounced the united states were the first in the field and in new york they made preparations for an expedition destined to pursue this narwhal a frigate of great speed the _abraham lincoln_ was put in commission as soon as possible the arsenals were opened to commander farragut who hastened the arming of his frigate but as it always happens the moment it was decided to pursue the monster the monster did not appear for two months no one heard it spoken of no ship met with it it seemed as if this unicorn knew of the plots weaving around it it had been so much talked of even through the atlantic cable that jesters pretended that this slender fly had stopped a telegram on its passage and was making the most of it so when the frigate had been armed for a long campaign and provided with formidable fishing apparatus no one could tell what course to pursue impatience grew apace when on the nd of july they learned that a steamer of the line of san francisco from california to shanghai had seen the animal three weeks before in the north pacific ocean the excitement caused by this news was extreme the ship was revictualled and well stocked with coal three hours before the _abraham lincoln_ left brooklyn pier i received a letter worded as follows to m aronnax professor in the museum of paris fifth avenue hotel new york sirif you will consent to join the _abraham lincoln_ in this expedition the government of the united states will with pleasure see france represented in the enterprise commander farragut has a cabin at your disposal very cordially yours jb hobson secretary of marine chapter iii i form my resolution three seconds before the arrival of j b hobsons letter i no more thought of pursuing the unicorn than of attempting the passage of the north sea three seconds after reading the letter of the honourable secretary of marine i felt that my true vocation the sole end of my life was to chase this disturbing monster and purge it from the world but i had just returned from a fatiguing journey weary and longing for repose i aspired to nothing more than again seeing my country my friends my little lodging by the jardin des plantes my dear and precious collections but nothing could keep me back i forgot allfatigue friends and collectionsand accepted without hesitation the offer of the american government besides thought i all roads lead back to europe for my particular benefit and i will not hurry me towards the coast of france this worthy animal may allow itself to be caught in the seas of europe for my particular benefit and i will not bring back less than half a yard of his ivory halberd to the museum of natural history but in the meanwhile i must seek this narwhal in the north pacific ocean which to return to france was taking the road to the antipodes conseil i called in an impatient voice conseil was my servant a true devoted flemish boy who had accompanied me in all my travels i liked him and he returned the liking well he was phlegmatic by nature regular from principle zealous from habit evincing little disturbance at the different surprises of life very quick with his hands and apt at any service required of him and despite his name never giving adviceeven when asked for it conseil had followed me for the last ten years wherever science led never once did he complain of the length or fatigue of a journey never make an objection to pack his portmanteau for whatever country it might be or however far away whether china or congo besides all this he had good health which defied all sickness and solid muscles but no nerves good morals are understood this boy was thirty years old and his age to that of his master as fifteen to twenty may i be excused for saying that i was forty years old but conseil had one fault he was ceremonious to a degree and would never speak to me but in the third person which was sometimes provoking conseil said i again beginning with feverish hands to make preparations for my departure certainly i was sure of this devoted boy as a rule i never asked him if it were convenient for him or not to follow me in my travels but this time the expedition in question might be prolonged and the enterprise might be hazardous in pursuit of an animal capable of sinking a frigate as easily as a nutshell here there was matter for reflection even to the most impassive man in the world what would conseil say conseil i called a third time conseil appeared did you call sir said he entering yes my boy make preparations for me and yourself too we leave in two hours as you please sir replied conseil quietly not an instant to loselock in my trunk all travelling utensils coats shirts and stockingswithout counting as many as you can and make haste and your collections sir observed conseil we will think of them by and by what the archiotherium the hyracotherium the oreodons the cheropotamus and the other skins they will keep them at the hotel and your live babiroussa sir they will feed it during our absence besides i will give orders to forward our menagerie to france we are not returning to paris then said conseil oh certainly i answered evasively by making a curve will the curve please you sir oh it will be nothing not quite so direct a road that is all we take our passage in the _abraham lincoln_ as you think proper sir coolly replied conseil you see my friend it has to do with the monsterthe famous narwhal we are going to purge it from the seas the author of a work in quarto in two volumes on the mysteries of the great submarine grounds cannot forbear embarking with commander farragut a glorious mission but a dangerous one we cannot tell where we may go these animals can be very capricious but we will go whether or no we have got a captain who is pretty wideawake i opened a credit account for babiroussa and conseil following i jumped into a cab our luggage was transported to the deck of the frigate immediately i hastened on board and asked for commander farragut one of the sailors conducted me to the poop where i found myself in the presence of a goodlooking officer who held out his hand to me monsieur pierre aronnax said he himself replied i commander farragut you are welcome professor your cabin is ready for you i bowed and desired to be conducted to the cabin destined for me the _abraham lincoln_ had been well chosen and equipped for her new destination she was a frigate of great speed fitted with highpressure engines which admitted a pressure of seven atmospheres under this the _abraham lincoln_ attained the mean speed of nearly eighteen knots and a third an houra considerable speed but nevertheless insufficient to grapple with this gigantic cetacean the interior arrangements of the frigate corresponded to its nautical qualities i was well satisfied with my cabin which was in the after part opening upon the gunroom we shall be well off here said i to conseil as well by your honours leave as a hermitcrab in the shell of a whelk said conseil i left conseil to stow our trunks conveniently away and remounted the poop in order to survey the preparations for departure at that moment commander farragut was ordering the last moorings to be cast loose which held the _abraham lincoln_ to the pier of brooklyn so in a quarter of an hour perhaps less the frigate would have sailed without me i should have missed this extraordinary supernatural and incredible expedition the recital of which may well meet with some scepticism but commander farragut would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the seas in which the animal had been sighted he sent for the engineer is the steam full on asked he yes sir replied the engineer go ahead cried commander farragut the quay of brooklyn and all that part of new york bordering on the east river was crowded with spectators three cheers burst successively from five hundred thousand throats thousands of handkerchiefs were waved above the heads of the compact mass saluting the _abraham lincoln_ until she reached the waters of the hudson at the point of that elongated peninsula which forms the town of new york then the frigate following the coast of new jersey along the right bank of the beautiful river covered with villas passed between the forts which saluted her with their heaviest guns the _abraham lincoln_ answered by hoisting the american colours three times whose thirtynine stars shone resplendent from the mizzenpeak then modifying its speed to take the narrow channel marked by buoys placed in the inner bay formed by sandy hook point it coasted the long sandy beach where some thousands of spectators gave it one final cheer the escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and did not leave her until they came abreast of the lightship whose two lights marked the entrance of new york channel six bells struck the pilot got into his boat and rejoined the little schooner which was waiting under our lee the fires were made up the screw beat the waves more rapidly the frigate skirted the low yellow coast of long island and at eight bells after having lost sight in the northwest of the lights of fire island she ran at full steam on to the dark waters of the atlantic chapter iv ned land captain farragut was a good seaman worthy of the frigate he commanded his vessel and he were one he was the soul of it on the question of the cetacean there was no doubt in his mind and he would not allow the existence of the animal to be disputed on board he believed in it as certain good women believe in the leviathanby faith not by reason the monster did exist and he had sworn to rid the seas of it he was a kind of knight of rhodes a second dieudonné de gozon going to meet the serpent which desolated the island either captain farragut would kill the narwhal or the narwhal would kill the captain there was no third course the officers on board shared the opinion of their chief they were ever chatting discussing and calculating the various chances of a meeting watching narrowly the vast surface of the ocean more than one took up his quarters voluntarily in the crosstrees who would have cursed such a berth under any other circumstances as long as the sun described its daily course the rigging was crowded with sailors whose feet were burnt to such an extent by the heat of the deck as to render it unbearable still the _abraham lincoln_ had not yet breasted the suspected waters of the pacific as to the ships company they desired nothing better than to meet the unicorn to harpoon it hoist it on board and despatch it they watched the sea with eager attention besides captain farragut had spoken of a certain sum of two thousand dollars set apart for whoever should first sight the monster were he cabinboy common seaman or officer i leave you to judge how eyes were used on board the _abraham lincoln_ for my own part i was not behind the others and left to no one my share of daily observations the frigate might have been called the _argus_ for a hundred reasons only one amongst us conseil seemed to protest by his indifference against the question which so interested us all and seemed to be out of keeping with the general enthusiasm on board i have said that captain farragut had carefully provided his ship with every apparatus for catching the gigantic cetacean no whaler had ever been better armed we possessed every known engine from the harpoon thrown by the hand to the barbed arrows of the blunderbuss and the explosive balls of the duckgun on the forecastle lay the perfection of a breechloading gun very thick at the breech and very narrow in the bore the model of which had been in the exhibition of this precious weapon of american origin could throw with ease a conical projectile of nine pounds to a mean distance of ten miles thus the _abraham lincoln_ wanted for no means of destruction and what was better still she had on board ned land the prince of harpooners ned land was a canadian with an uncommon quickness of hand and who knew no equal in his dangerous occupation skill coolness audacity and cunning he possessed in a superior degree and it must be a cunning whale or a singularly cute cachalot to escape the stroke of his harpoon ned land was about forty years of age he was a tall man more than six feet high strongly built grave and taciturn occasionally violent and very passionate when contradicted his person attracted attention but above all the boldness of his look which gave a singular expression to his face who calls himself canadian calls himself french and little communicative as ned land was i must admit that he took a certain liking for me my nationality drew him to me no doubt it was an opportunity for him to talk and for me to hear that old language of rabelais which is still in use in some canadian provinces the harpooners family was originally from quebec and was already a tribe of hardy fishermen when this town belonged to france little by little ned land acquired a taste for chatting and i loved to hear the recital of his adventures in the polar seas he related his fishing and his combats with natural poetry of expression his recital took the form of an epic poem and i seemed to be listening to a canadian homer singing the iliad of the regions of the north i am portraying this hardy companion as i really knew him we are old friends now united in that unchangeable friendship which is born and cemented amidst extreme dangers ah brave ned i ask no more than to live a hundred years longer that i may have more time to dwell the longer on your memory now what was ned lands opinion upon the question of the marine monster i must admit that he did not believe in the unicorn and was the only one on board who did not share that universal conviction he even avoided the subject which i one day thought it my duty to press upon him one magnificent evening the th of julythat is to say three weeks after our departurethe frigate was abreast of cape blanc thirty miles to leeward of the coast of patagonia we had crossed the tropic of capricorn and the straits of magellan opened less than seven hundred miles to the south before eight days were over the _abraham lincoln_ would be ploughing the waters of the pacific seated on the poop ned land and i were chatting of one thing and another as we looked at this mysterious sea whose great depths had up to this time been inaccessible to the eye of man i naturally led up the conversation to the giant unicorn and examined the various chances of success or failure of the expedition but seeing that ned land let me speak without saying too much himself i pressed him more closely well ned said i is it possible that you are not convinced of the existence of this cetacean that we are following have you any particular reason for being so incredulous the harpooner looked at me fixedly for some moments before answering struck his broad forehead with his hand a habit of his as if to collect himself and said at last perhaps i have m aronnax but ned you a whaler by profession familiarised with all the great marine mammaliayou whose imagination might easily accept the hypothesis of enormous cetaceans _you_ ought to be the last to doubt under such circumstances that is just what deceives you professor replied ned that the vulgar should believe in extraordinary comets traversing space and in the existence of antediluvian monsters in the heart of the globe may well be but neither astronomer nor geologist believes in such chimeras as a whaler i have followed many a cetacean harpooned a great number and killed several but however strong or wellarmed they may have been neither their tails nor their weapons would have been able even to scratch the iron plates of a steamer but ned they tell of ships which the teeth of the narwhal have pierced through and through wooden shipsthat is possible replied the canadian but i have never seen it done and until further proof i deny that whales cetaceans or seaunicorns could ever produce the effect you describe well ned i repeat it with a conviction resting on the logic of facts i believe in the existence of a mammal powerfully organised belonging to the branch of vertebrata like the whales the cachalots or the dolphins and furnished with a horn of defence of great penetrating power hum said the harpooner shaking his head with the air of a man who would not be convinced notice one thing my worthy canadian i resumed if such an animal is in existence if it inhabits the depths of the ocean if it frequents the strata lying miles below the surface of the water it must necessarily possess an organisation the strength of which would defy all comparison and why this powerful organisation demanded ned because it requires incalculable strength to keep ones self in these strata and resist their pressure listen to me let us admit that the pressure of the atmosphere is represented by the weight of a column of water thirtytwo feet high in reality the column of water would be shorter as we are speaking of sea water the density of which is greater than that of fresh water very well when you dive ned as many times thirtytwo feet of water as there are above you so many times does your body bear a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere that is to say lbs for each square inch of its surface it follows then that at feet this pressure that of atmospheres of atmospheres at feet and of atmospheres at feet that is about miles which is equivalent to saying that if you could attain this depth in the ocean each square threeeighths of an inch of the surface of your body would bear a pressure of lbs ah my brave ned do you know how many square inches you carry on the surface of your body i have no idea m aronnax about and as in reality the atmospheric pressure is about lbs to the square inch your square inches bear at this moment a pressure of lbs without my perceiving it without your perceiving it and if you are not crushed by such a pressure it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body with equal pressure hence perfect equilibrium between the interior and exterior pressure which thus neutralise each other and which allows you to bear it without inconvenience but in the water it is another thing yes i understand replied ned becoming more attentive because the water surrounds me but does not penetrate precisely ned so that at feet beneath the surface of the sea you would undergo a pressure of lbs at feet ten times that pressure at feet a hundred times that pressure lastly at feet a thousand times that pressure would be lbsthat is to say that you would be flattened as if you had been drawn from the plates of a hydraulic machine the devil exclaimed ned very well my worthy harpooner if some vertebrate several hundred yards long and large in proportion can maintain itself in such depthsof those whose surface is represented by millions of square inches that is by tens of millions of pounds we must estimate the pressure they undergo consider then what must be the resistance of their bony structure and the strength of their organisation to withstand such pressure why exclaimed ned land they must be made of iron plates eight inches thick like the armoured frigates as you say ned and think what destruction such a mass would cause if hurled with the speed of an express train against the hull of a vessel yescertainlyperhaps replied the canadian shaken by these figures but not yet willing to give in well have i convinced you you have convinced me of one thing sir which is that if such animals do exist at the bottom of the seas they must necessarily be as strong as you say but if they do not exist mine obstinate harpooner how explain the accident to the _scotia_ chapter v at a venture the voyage of the _abraham lincoln_ was for a long time marked by no special incident but one circumstance happened which showed the wonderful dexterity of ned land and proved what confidence we might place in him the th of june the frigate spoke some american whalers from whom we learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal but one of them the captain of the _monroe_ knowing that ned land had shipped on board the _abraham lincoln_ begged for his help in chasing a whale they had in sight commander farragut desirous of seeing ned land at work gave him permission to go on board the _monroe_ and fate served our canadian so well that instead of one whale he harpooned two with a double blow striking one straight to the heart and catching the other after some minutes pursuit decidedly if the monster ever had to do with ned lands harpoon i would not bet in its favour the frigate skirted the southeast coast of america with great rapidity the rd of july we were at the opening of the straits of magellan level with cape vierges but commander farragut would not take a tortuous passage but doubled cape horn the ships crew agreed with him and certainly it was possible that they might meet the narwhal in this narrow pass many of the sailors affirmed that the monster could not pass there that he was too big for that the th of july about three oclock in the afternoon the _abraham lincoln_ at fifteen miles to the south doubled the solitary island this lost rock at the extremity of the american continent to which some dutch sailors gave the name of their native town cape horn the course was taken towards the northwest and the next day the screw of the frigate was at last beating the waters of the pacific keep your eyes open called out the sailors and they were opened widely both eyes and glasses a little dazzled it is true by the prospect of two thousand dollars had not an instants repose day and night they watched the surface of the ocean and even nyctalopes whose faculty of seeing in the darkness multiplies their chances a hundredfold would have had enough to do to gain the prize i myself for whom money had no charms was not the least attentive on board giving but few minutes to my meals but a few hours to sleep indifferent to either rain or sunshine i did not leave the poop of the vessel now leaning on the netting of the forecastle now on the taffrail i devoured with eagerness the soft foam which whitened the sea as far as the eye could reach and how often have i shared the emotion of the majority of the crew when some capricious whale raised its black back above the waves the poop of the vessel was crowded in a moment the cabins poured forth a torrent of sailors and officers each with heaving breast and troubled eye watching the course of the cetacean i looked and looked till i was nearly blind whilst conseil always phlegmatic kept repeating in a calm voice if sir you would not squint so much you would see better but vain excitement the _abraham lincoln_ checked its speed and made for the animal signalled a simple whale or common cachalot which soon disappeared amidst a storm of execration but the weather was good the voyage was being accomplished under the most favourable auspices it was then the bad season in australia the july of that zone corresponding to our january in europe but the sea was beautiful and easily scanned round a vast circumference the th of july the tropic of capricorn was cut by of longitude and the th of the same month we crossed the equator on the th meridian this passed the frigate took a more decided westerly direction and scoured the central waters of the pacific commander farragut thought and with reason that it was better to remain in deep water and keep clear of continents or islands which the beast itself seemed to shun perhaps because there was not enough water for him suggested the greater part of the crew the frigate passed at some distance from the marquesas and the sandwich islands crossed the tropic of cancer and made for the china seas we were on the theatre of the last diversions of the monster and to say truth we no longer _lived_ on board hearts palpitated fearfully preparing themselves for future incurable aneurism the entire ships crew were undergoing a nervous excitement of which i can give no idea they could not eat they could not sleeptwenty times a day a misconception or an optical illusion of some sailor seated on the taffrail would cause dreadful perspirations and these emotions twenty times repeated kept us in a state of excitement so violent that a reaction was unavoidable and truly reaction soon showed itself for three months during which a day seemed an age the _abraham lincoln_ furrowed all the waters of the northern pacific running at whales making sharp deviations from her course veering suddenly from one tack to another stopping suddenly putting on steam and backing ever and anon at the risk of deranging her machinery and not one point of the japanese or american coast was left unexplored the warmest partisans of the enterprise now became its most ardent detractors reaction mounted from the crew to the captain himself and certainly had it not been for resolute determination on the part of captain farragut the frigate would have headed due southward this useless search could not last much longer the _abraham lincoln_ had nothing to reproach herself with she had done her best to succeed never had an american ships crew shown more zeal or patience its failure could not be placed to their chargethere remained nothing but to return this was represented to the commander the sailors could not hide their discontent and the service suffered i will not say there was a mutiny on board but after a reasonable period of obstinacy captain farragut as columbus did asked for three days patience if in three days the monster did not appear the man at the helm should give three turns of the wheel and the _abraham lincoln_ would make for the european seas this promise was made on the nd of november it had the effect of rallying the ships crew the ocean was watched with renewed attention each one wished for a last glance in which to sum up his remembrance glasses were used with feverish activity it was a grand defiance given to the giant narwhal and he could scarcely fail to answer the summons and appear two days passed the steam was at half pressure a thousand schemes were tried to attract the attention and stimulate the apathy of the animal in case it should be met in those parts large quantities of bacon were trailed in the wake of the ship to the great satisfaction i must say of the sharks small craft radiated in all directions round the _abraham lincoln_ as she lay to and did not leave a spot of the sea unexplored but the night of the th of november arrived without the unveiling of this submarine mystery the next day the th of november at twelve the delay would morally speaking expire after that time commander farragut faithful to his promise was to turn the course to the southeast and abandon for ever the northern regions of the pacific the frigate was then in north latitude and east longitude the coast of japan still remained less than two hundred miles to leeward night was approaching they had just struck eight bells large clouds veiled the face of the moon then in its first quarter the sea undulated peaceably under the stern of the vessel at that moment i was leaning forward on the starboard netting conseil standing near me was looking straight before him the crew perched in the ratlines examined the horizon which contracted and darkened by degrees officers with their night glasses scoured the growing darkness sometimes the ocean sparkled under the rays of the moon which darted between two clouds then all trace of light was lost in the darkness in looking at conseil i could see he was undergoing a little of the general influence at least i thought so perhaps for the first time his nerves vibrated to a sentiment of curiosity come conseil said i this is the last chance of pocketing the two thousand dollars may i be permitted to say sir replied conseil that i never reckoned on getting the prize and had the government of the union offered a hundred thousand dollars it would have been none the poorer you are right conseil it is a foolish affair after all and one upon which we entered too lightly what time lost what useless emotions we should have been back in france six months ago in your little room sir replied conseil and in your museum sir and i should have already classed all your fossils sir and the babiroussa would have been installed in its cage in the jardin des plantes and have drawn all the curious people of the capital as you say conseil i fancy we shall run a fair chance of being laughed at for our pains thats tolerably certain replied conseil quietly i think they will make fun of you sir and must i say it go on my good friend well sir you will only get your deserts indeed when one has the honour of being a savant as you are sir one should not expose ones self to conseil had not time to finish his compliment in the midst of general silence a voice had just been heard it was the voice of ned land shouting look out there the very thing we are looking foron our weather beam chapter vi at full steam at this cry the whole ships crew hurried towards the harpoonercommander officers masters sailors cabin boys even the engineers left their engines and the stokers their furnaces the order to stop her had been given and the frigate now simply went on by her own momentum the darkness was then profound and however good the canadians eyes were i asked myself how he had managed to see and what he had been able to see my heart beat as if it would break but ned land was not mistaken and we all perceived the object he pointed to at two cables length from the _abraham lincoln_ on the starboard quarter the sea seemed to be illuminated all over it was not a mere phosphoric phenomenon the monster emerged some fathoms from the water and then threw out that very intense but inexplicable light mentioned in the report of several captains this magnificent irradiation must have been produced by an agent of great _shining_ power the luminous part traced on the sea an immense oval much elongated the centre of which condensed a burning heat whose overpowering brilliancy died out by successive gradations it is only an agglomeration of phosphoric particles cried one of the officers no sir certainly not i replied never did pholades or salpæ produce such a powerful light that brightness is of an essentially electrical nature besides see see it moves it is moving forwards backwards it is darting towards us a general cry rose from the frigate silence said the captain up with the helm reverse the engines the steam was shut off and the _abraham lincoln_ beating to port described a semicircle right the helm go ahead cried the captain these orders were executed and the frigate moved rapidly from the burning light i was mistaken she tried to sheer off but the supernatural animal approached with a velocity double her own we gasped for breath stupefaction more than fear made us dumb and motionless the animal gained on us sporting with the waves it made the round of the frigate which was then making fourteen knots and enveloped it with its electric rings like luminous dust then it moved away two or three miles leaving a phosphorescent track like those volumes of steam that the express trains leave behind all at once from the dark line of the horizon whither it retired to gain its momentum the monster rushed suddenly towards the _abraham lincoln_ with alarming rapidity stopped suddenly about twenty feet from the hull and died outnot diving under the water for its brilliancy did not abatebut suddenly and as if the source of this brilliant emanation was exhausted then it reappeared on the other side of the vessel as if it had turned and slid under the hull any moment a collision might have occurred which would have been fatal to us however i was astonished at the manœuvres of the frigate she fled and did not attack on the captains face generally so impassive was an expression of unaccountable astonishment m aronnax he said i do not know with what formidable being i have to deal and i will not imprudently risk my frigate in the midst of this darkness besides how attack this unknown thing how defend ones self from it wait for daylight and the scene will change you have no further doubt captain of the nature of the animal no sir it is evidently a gigantic narwhal and an electric one perhaps added i one can only approach it with a gymnotus or a torpedo undoubtedly replied the captain if it possesses such dreadful power it is the most terrible animal that ever was created that is why sir i must be on my guard the crew were on their feet all night no one thought of sleep the _abraham lincoln_ not being able to struggle with such velocity had moderated its pace and sailed at half speed for its part the narwhal imitating the frigate let the waves rock it at will and seemed decided not to leave the scene of the struggle towards midnight however it disappeared or to use a more appropriate term it died out like a large glowworm had it fled one could only fear not hope but at seven minutes to one oclock in the morning a deafening whistling was heard like that produced by a body of water rushing with great violence the captain ned land and i were then on the poop eagerly peering through the profound darkness ned land asked the commander you have often heard the roaring of whales often sir but never such whales the sight of which brought me in two thousand dollars if i can only approach within four harpoon lengths of it but to approach it said the commander i ought to put a whaler at your disposal certainly sir that will be trifling with the lives of my men and mine too simply said the harpooner towards two oclock in the morning the burning light reappeared not less intense about five miles to windward of the _abraham lincoln_ notwithstanding the distance and the noise of the wind and sea one heard distinctly the loud strokes of the animals tail and even its panting breath it seemed that at the moment that the enormous narwhal had come to take breath at the surface of the water the air was engulfed in its lungs like the steam in the vast cylinders of a machine of two thousand horsepower hum thought i a whale with the strength of a cavalry regiment would be a pretty whale we were on the _qui vive_ till daylight and prepared for the combat the fishing implements were laid along the hammock nettings the second lieutenant loaded the blunderbusses which could throw harpoons to the distance of a mile and long duckguns with explosive bullets which inflicted mortal wounds even to the most terrible animals ned land contented himself with sharpening his harpoona terrible weapon in his hands at six oclock day began to break and with the first glimmer of light the electric light of the narwhal disappeared at seven oclock the day was sufficiently advanced but a very thick sea fog obscured our view and the best spyglasses could not pierce it that caused disappointment and anger i climbed the mizzenmast some officers were already perched on the mast heads at eight oclock the fog lay heavily on the waves and its thick scrolls rose little by little the horizon grew wider and clearer at the same time suddenly just as on the day before ned lands voice was heard the thing itself on the port quarter cried the harpooner every eye was turned towards the point indicated there a mile and a half from the frigate a long blackish body emerged a yard above the waves its tail violently agitated produced a considerable eddy never did a caudal appendage beat the sea with such violence an immense track of dazzling whiteness marked the passage of the animal and described a long curve the frigate approached the cetacean i examined it thoroughly the reports of the _shannon_ and of the _helvetia_ had rather exaggerated its size and i estimated its length at only two hundred and fifty feet as to its dimensions i could only conjecture them to be admirably proportioned while i watched this phenomenon two jets of steam and water were ejected from its vents and rose to the height of feet thus i ascertained its way of breathing i concluded definitely that it belonged to the vertebrate branch class mammalia the crew waited impatiently for their chiefs orders the latter after having observed the animal attentively called the engineer the engineer ran to him sir said the commander you have steam up yes sir answered the engineer well make up your fires and put on all steam three hurrahs greeted this order the time for the struggle had arrived some moments after the two funnels of the frigate vomited torrents of black smoke and the bridge quaked under the trembling of the boilers the _abraham lincoln_ propelled by her wonderful screw went straight at the animal the latter allowed it to come within half a cables length then as if disdaining to dive it took a little turn and stopped a short distance off this pursuit lasted nearly threequarters of an hour without the frigate gaining two yards on the cetacean it was quite evident that at that rate we should never come up with it well mr land asked the captain do you advise me to put the boats out to sea no sir replied ned land because we shall not take that beast easily what shall we do then put on more steam if you can sir with your leave i mean to post myself under the bowsprit and if we get within harpooning distance i shall throw my harpoon go ned said the captain engineer put on more pressure ned land went to his post the fires were increased the screw revolved fortythree times a minute and the steam poured out of the valves we heaved the log and calculated that the _abraham lincoln_ was going at the rate of ½ miles an hour but the accursed animal swam too at the rate of ½ miles an hour for a whole hour the frigate kept up this pace without gaining six feet it was humiliating for one of the swiftest sailers in the american navy a stubborn anger seized the crew the sailors abused the monster who as before disdained to answer them the captain no longer contented himself with twisting his beardhe gnawed it the engineer was again called you have turned full steam in yes sir replied the engineer the speed of the _abraham lincoln_ increased its masts trembled down to their stepping holes and the clouds of smoke could hardly find way out of the narrow funnels they heaved the log a second time well asked the captain of the man at the wheel nineteen miles and threetenths sir clap on more steam the engineer obeyed the manometer showed ten degrees but the cetacean grew warm itself no doubt for without straining itself it made miles what a pursuit no i cannot describe the emotion that vibrated through me ned land kept his post harpoon in hand several times the animal let us gain upon itwe shall catch it we shall catch it cried the canadian but just as he was going to strike the cetacean stole away with a rapidity that could not be estimated at less than thirty miles an hour and even during our maximum of speed it bullied the frigate going round and round it a cry of fury broke from everyone at noon we were no further advanced than at eight oclock in the morning the captain then decided to take more direct means ah said he that animal goes quicker than the _abraham lincoln_ very well we will see whether it will escape these conical bullets send your men to the forecastle sir the forecastle gun was immediately loaded and slewed round but the shot passed some feet above the cetacean which was half a mile off another more to the right cried the commander and five dollars to whoever will hit that infernal beast an old gunner with a grey beardthat i can see nowwith steady eye and grave face went up to the gun and took a long aim a loud report was heard with which were mingled the cheers of the crew illustration an old greybearded gunner the bullet did its work it hit the animal but not fatally and sliding off the rounded surface was lost in two miles depth of sea the chase began again and the captain leaning towards me said i will pursue that beast till my frigate bursts up yes answered i and you will be quite right to do it i wished the beast would exhaust itself and not be insensible to fatigue like a steam engine but it was of no use hours passed without its showing any signs of exhaustion however it must be said in praise of the _abraham lincoln_ that she struggled on indefatigably i cannot reckon the distance she made under three hundred miles during this unlucky day november the th but night came on and overshadowed the rough ocean now i thought our expedition was at an end and that we should never again see the extraordinary animal i was mistaken at ten minutes to eleven in the evening the electric light reappeared three miles to windward of the frigate as pure as intense as during the preceding night the narwhal seemed motionless perhaps tired with its days work it slept letting itself float with the undulation of the waves now was a chance of which the captain resolved to take advantage he gave his orders the _abraham lincoln_ kept up half steam and advanced cautiously so as not to awake its adversary it is no rare thing to meet in the middle of the ocean whales so sound asleep that they can be successfully attacked and ned land had harpooned more than one during its sleep the canadian went to take his place again under the bowsprit the frigate approached noiselessly stopped at two cables lengths from the animal and following its track no one breathed a deep silence reigned on the bridge we were not a hundred feet from the burning focus the light of which increased and dazzled our eyes at this moment leaning on the forecastle bulwark i saw below me ned land grappling the martingale in one hand brandishing his terrible harpoon in the other scarcely twenty feet from the motionless animal suddenly his arm straightened and the harpoon was thrown i heard the sonorous stroke of the weapon which seemed to have struck a hard body the electric light went out suddenly and two enormous waterspouts broke over the bridge of the frigate rushing like a torrent from stem to stern overthrowing men and breaking the lashings of the spars a fearful shock followed and thrown over the rail without having time to stop myself i fell into the sea chapter vii an unknown species of whale this unexpected fall so stunned me that i have no clear recollection of my sensations at the time i was at first drawn down to a depth of about twenty feet i am a good swimmer though without pretending to rival byron or edgar poe who were masters of the art and in that plunge i did not lose my presence of mind two vigorous strokes brought me to the surface of the water my first care was to look for the frigate had the crew seen me disappear had the _abraham lincoln_ veered round would the captain put out a boat might i hope to be saved the darkness was intense i caught a glimpse of a black mass disappearing in the east its beacon lights dying out in the distance it was the frigate i was lost help help i shouted swimming towards the _abraham lincoln_ in desperation my clothes encumbered me they seemed glued to my body and paralysed my movements i was sinking i was suffocating help this was my last cry my mouth filled with water i struggled against being drawn down the abyss suddenly my clothes were seized by a strong hand and i felt myself quickly drawn up to the surface of the sea and i heard yes i heard these words pronounced in my ear if master would be so good as to lean on my shoulder master would swim with much greater ease i seized with one hand my faithful conseils arm is it you said i you myself answered conseil and waiting masters orders that shock threw you as well as me into the sea no but being in my masters service i followed him the worthy fellow thought that was but natural and the frigate i asked the frigate replied conseil turning on his back i think that master had better not count too much on her you think so i say that at the time i threw myself into the sea i heard the men at the wheel say the screw and the rudder are broken broken yes broken by the monsters teeth it is the only injury the _abraham lincoln_ has sustained but it is a bad look out for usshe no longer answers her helm then we are lost perhaps so calmly answered conseil however we have still several hours before us and one can do a good deal in some hours conseils imperturbable coolness set me up again i swam more vigorously but cramped by my clothes which stuck to me like a leaden weight i felt great difficulty in bearing up conseil saw this will master let me make a slit said he and slipping an open knife under my clothes he ripped them up from top to bottom very rapidly then he cleverly slipped them off me while i swam for both of us then i did the same for conseil and we continued to swim near to each other nevertheless our situation was no less terrible perhaps our disappearance had not been noticed and if it had been the frigate could not tack being without its helm conseil argued on this supposition and laid his plans accordingly this phlegmatic boy was perfectly selfpossessed we then decided that as our only chance of safety was being picked up by the _abraham lincolns_ boats we ought to manage so as to wait for them as long as possible i resolved then to husband our strength so that both should not be exhausted at the same time and this is how we managed while one of us lay on our back quite still with arms crossed and legs stretched out the other would swim and push the other on in front this towing business did not last more than ten minutes each and relieving each other thus we could swim on for some hours perhaps till daybreak poor chance but hope is so firmly rooted in the heart of man moreover there were two of us indeed i declare though it may seem improbable if i sought to destroy all hopeif i wished to despair i could not the collision of the frigate with the cetacean had occurred about eleven oclock the evening before i reckoned then we should have eight hours to swim before sunrise an operation quite practicable if we relieved each other the sea very calm was in our favour sometimes i tried to pierce the intense darkness that was only dispelled by the phosphorescence caused by our movements i watched the luminous waves that broke over my hand whose mirrorlike surface was spotted with silvery rings one might have said that we were in a bath of quicksilver near one oclock in the morning i was seized with dreadful fatigue my limbs stiffened under the strain of violent cramp conseil was obliged to keep me up and our preservation devolved on him alone i heard the poor boy pant his breathing became short and hurried i found that he could not keep up much longer leave me leave me i said to him leave my master never replied he i would drown first just then the moon appeared through the fringes of a thick cloud that the wind was driving to the east the surface of the sea glittered with its rays this kindly light reanimated us my head got better again i looked at all points of the horizon i saw the frigate she was five miles from us and looked like a dark mass hardly discernible but no boats i would have cried out but what good would it have been at such a distance my swollen lips could utter no sounds conseil could articulate some words and i heard him repeat at intervals help help our movements were suspended for an instant we listened it might be only a singing in the ear but it seemed to me as if a cry answered the cry from conseil did you hear i murmured yes yes and conseil gave one more despairing call this time there was no mistake a human voice responded to ours was it the voice of another unfortunate creature abandoned in the middle of the ocean some other victim of the shock sustained by the vessel or rather was it a boat from the frigate that was hailing us in the darkness conseil made a last effort and leaning on my shoulder while i struck out in a despairing effort he raised himself half out of the water then fell back exhausted what did you see i sawmurmured he i sawbut do not talkreserve all your strength what had he seen then i know not why the thought of the monster came into my head for the first time but that voice the time is past for jonahs to take refuge in whales bellies however conseil was towing me again he raised his head sometimes looked before us and uttered a cry of recognition which was responded to by a voice that came nearer and nearer i scarcely heard it my strength was exhausted my fingers stiffened my hand afforded me support no longer my mouth convulsively opening filled with salt water cold crept over me i raised my head for the last time then i sank at this moment a hard body struck me i clung to it then i felt that i was being drawn up that i was brought to the surface of the water that my chest collapsedi fainted it is certain that i soon came to thanks to the vigorous rubbings that i received i half opened my eyes conseil i murmured does master call me asked conseil just then by the waning light of the moon which was sinking down to the horizon i saw a face which was not conseils and which i immediately recognised ned i cried the same sir who is seeking his prize replied the canadian were you thrown into the sea by the shock to the frigate yes professor but more fortunate than you i was able to find a footing almost directly upon a floating island an island or more correctly speaking on our gigantic narwhal explain yourself ned only i soon found out why my harpoon had not entered its skin and was blunted why ned why because professor that beast is made of sheet iron the canadians last words produced a sudden revolution in my brain i wriggled myself quickly to the top of the being or object half out of the water which served us for a refuge i kicked it it was evidently a hard impenetrable body and not the soft substance that forms the bodies of the great marine mammalia but this hard body might be a bony carapace like that of the antediluvian animals and i should be free to class this monster among amphibious reptiles such as tortoises or alligators well no the blackish back that supported me was smooth polished without scales the blow produced a metallic sound and incredible though it may be it seemed i might say as if it was made of riveted plates there was no doubt about it this monster this natural phenomenon that had puzzled the learned world and overthrown and misled the imagination of seamen of both hemispheres it must be owned a still more astonishing phenomenon inasmuch as it was a simply human construction we had no time to lose however we were lying upon the back of a sort of submarine boat which appeared as far as i could judge like a huge fish of steel ned lands mind was made up on this point conseil and i could only agree with him just then a bubbling began at the back of this strange thing which was evidently propelled by a screw and it began to move we had only just time to seize hold of the upper part which rose about seven feet out of the water and happily its speed was not great as long as it sails horizontally muttered ned land i do not mind but if it takes a fancy to dive i would not give two straws for my life the canadian might have said still less it became really necessary to communicate with the beings whatever they were shut up inside the machine i searched all over the outside for an aperture a panel or a manhole to use a technical expression but the lines of the iron rivets solidly driven into the joints of the iron plates were clear and uniform besides the moon disappeared then and left us in total darkness at last this long night passed my indistinct remembrance prevents my describing all the impressions it made i can only recall one circumstance during some lulls of the wind and sea i fancied i heard several times vague sounds a sort of fugitive harmony produced by words of command what was then the mystery of this submarine craft of which the whole world vainly sought an explanation what kind of beings existed in this strange boat what mechanical agent caused its prodigious speed daybreak appeared the morning mists surrounded us but they soon cleared off i was about to examine the hull which formed on deck a kind of horizontal platform when i felt it gradually sinking oh confound it cried ned land kicking the resounding plate open you inhospitable rascals happily the sinking movement ceased suddenly a noise like iron works violently pushed aside came from the interior of the boat one iron plate was moved a man appeared uttered an odd cry and disappeared immediately some moments after eight strong men with masked faces appeared noiselessly and drew us down into their formidable machine chapter viii mobilis in mobili this forcible abduction so roughly carried out was accomplished with the rapidity of lightning i shivered all over whom had we to deal with no doubt some new sort of pirates who explored the sea in their own way hardly had the narrow panel closed upon me when i was enveloped in darkness my eyes dazzled with the outer light could distinguish nothing i felt my naked feet cling to the rungs of an iron ladder ned land and conseil firmly seized followed me at the bottom of the ladder a door opened and shut after us immediately with a bang we were alone where i could not say hardly imagine all was black and such a dense black that after some minutes my eyes had not been able to discern even the faintest glimmer meanwhile ned land furious at these proceedings gave free vent to his indignation confound it cried he here are people who come up to the scotch for hospitality they only just miss being cannibals i should not be surprised at it but i declare that they shall not eat me without my protesting calm yourself friend ned calm yourself replied conseil quietly do not cry out before you are hurt we are not quite done for yet not quite sharply replied the canadian but pretty near at all events things look black happily my bowie knife i have still and i can always see well enough to use it the first of these pirates who lays a hand on me do not excite yourself ned i said to the harpooner and do not compromise us by useless violence who knows that they will not listen to us let us rather try to find out where we are i groped about in five steps i came to an iron wall made of plates bolted together then turning back i struck against a wooden table near which were ranged several stools the boards of this prison were concealed under a thick mat of phormium which deadened the noise of the feet the bare walls revealed no trace of window or door conseil going round the reverse way met me and we went back to the middle of the cabin which measured about twenty feet by ten as to its height ned land in spite of his own great height could not measure it half an hour had already passed without our situation being bettered when the dense darkness suddenly gave way to extreme light our prison was suddenly lightedthat is to say it became filled with a luminous matter so strong that i could not bear it at first in its whiteness and intensity i recognised that electric light which played round the submarine boat like a magnificent phenomenon of phosphorescence after shutting my eyes involuntarily i opened them and saw that this luminous agent came from a half globe unpolished placed in the roof of the cabin at last one can see cried ned land who knife in hand stood on the defensive yes said i but we are still in the dark about ourselves let master have patience said the imperturbable conseil the sudden lighting of the cabin enabled me to examine it minutely it only contained a table and five stools the invisible door might be hermetically sealed no noise was heard all seemed dead in the interior of this boat did it move did it float on the surface of the ocean or did it dive into its depths i could not guess a noise of bolts was now heard the door opened and two men appeared one was short very muscular broadshouldered with robust limbs strong head an abundance of black hair thick moustache a quick penetrating look and the vivacity which characterises the population of southern france the second stranger merits a more detailed description a disciple of gratiolet or engel would have read his face like an open book i made out his prevailing qualities directlyselfconfidencebecause his head was well set on his shoulders and his black eyes looked around with cold assurance calmnessfor his skin rather pale showed his coolness of blood energyevinced by the rapid contraction of his lofty brows and couragebecause his deep breathing denoted great power of lungs whether this person was thirtyfive or fifty years of age i could not say he was tall had a large forehead straight nose a clearly cut mouth beautiful teeth with fine taper hands indicative of a highly nervous temperament this man was certainly the most admirable specimen i had ever met one particular feature was his eyes rather far from each other and which could take in nearly a quarter of the horizon at once this facultyi verified it latergave him a range of vision far superior to ned lands when this stranger fixed upon an object his eyebrows met his large eyelids closed around so as to contract the range of his vision and he looked as if he magnified the objects lessened by distance as if he pierced those sheets of water so opaque to our eyes and as if he read the very depths of the seas the two strangers with caps made from the fur of the sea otter and shod with sea boots of seals skin were dressed in clothes of a particular texture which allowed free movement of the limbs the taller of the two evidently the chief on board examined us with great attention without saying a word then turning to his companion talked with him in an unknown tongue it was a sonorous harmonious and flexible dialect the vowels seeming to admit of very varied accentuation the other replied by a shake of the head and added two or three perfectly incomprehensible words then he seemed to question me by a look i replied in good french that i did not know his language but he seemed not to understand me and my situation became more embarrassing if master were to tell our story said conseil perhaps these gentlemen may understand some words i began to tell our adventures articulating each syllable clearly and without omitting one single detail i announced our names and rank introducing in person professor aronnax his servant conseil and master ned land the harpooner the man with the soft calm eyes listened to me quietly even politely and with extreme attention but nothing in his countenance indicated that he had understood my story when i finished he said not a word there remained one resource to speak english perhaps they would know this almost universal language i knew it as well as the german languagewell enough to read it fluently but not to speak it correctly but anyhow we must make ourselves understood go on in your turn i said to the harpooner speak your best anglosaxon and try to do better than i ned did not beg off and recommenced our story to his great disgust the harpooner did not seem to have made himself more intelligible than i had our visitors did not stir they evidently understood neither the language of arago nor of faraday very much embarrassed after having vainly exhausted our speaking resources i knew not what part to take when conseil said if master will permit me i will relate it in german but in spite of the elegant terms and good accent of the narrator the german language had no success at last nonplussed i tried to remember my first lessons and to narrate our adventures in latin but with no better success this last attempt being of no avail the two strangers exchanged some words in their unknown language and retired the door shut it is an infamous shame cried ned land who broke out for the twentieth time we speak to those rogues in french english german and latin and not one of them has the politeness to answer calm yourself i said to the impetuous ned anger will do no good but do you see professor replied our irascible companion that we shall absolutely die of hunger in this iron cage bah said conseil philosophically we can hold out some time yet my friends i said we must not despair we have been worse off than this do me the favour to wait a little before forming an opinion upon the commander and crew of this boat my opinion is formed replied ned land sharply they are rascals good and from what country from the land of rogues my brave ned that country is not clearly indicated on the map of the world but i admit that the nationality of the two strangers is hard to determine neither english french nor german that is quite certain however i am inclined to think that the commander and his companion were born in low latitudes there is southern blood in them but i cannot decide by their appearance whether they are spaniards turks arabians or indians as to their language it is quite incomprehensible there is the disadvantage of not knowing all languages said conseil or the disadvantage of not having one universal language as he said these words the door opened a steward entered he brought us clothes coats and trousers made of a stuff i did not know i hastened to dress myself and my companions followed my example during that time the stewarddumb perhaps deafhad arranged the table and laid three plates this is something like said conseil bah said the rancorous harpooner what do you suppose they eat here tortoise liver filleted shark and beefsteaks from seadogs we shall see said conseil the dishes of bell metal were placed on the table and we took our places undoubtedly we had to do with civilised people and had it not been for the electric light which flooded us i could have fancied i was in the diningroom of the adelphi hotel at liverpool or at the grand hotel in paris i must say however that there was neither bread nor wine the water was fresh and clear but it was water and did not suit ned lands taste amongst the dishes which were brought to us i recognised several fish delicately dressed but of some although excellent i could give no opinion neither could i tell to what kingdom they belonged whether animal or vegetable as to the dinner service it was elegant and in perfect taste each utensil spoon fork knife plate had a letter engraved on it with a motto above it of which this is an exact facsimile mobilis in mobili n the letter n was no doubt the initial of the name of the enigmatical person who commanded at the bottom of the sea ned and conseil did not reflect much they devoured the food and i did likewise i was besides reassured as to our fate and it seemed evident that our hosts would not let us die of want however everything has an end everything passes away even the hunger of people who have not eaten for fifteen hours our appetites satisfied we felt overcome with sleep faith i shall sleep well said conseil so shall i replied ned land my two companions stretched themselves on the cabin carpet and were soon sound asleep for my own part too many thoughts crowded my brain too many insoluble questions pressed upon me too many fancies kept my eyes half open where were we what strange power carried us on i feltor rather fancied i feltthe machine sinking down to the lowest beds of the sea dreadful nightmares beset me i saw in these mysterious asylums a world of unknown animals amongst which this submarine boat seemed to be of the same kind living moving and formidable as they then my brain grew calmer my imagination wandered into vague unconsciousness and i soon fell into a deep sleep chapter ix ned lands tempers how long we slept i do not know but our sleep must have lasted long for it rested us completely from our fatigues i woke first my companions had not moved and were still stretched in their corner hardly roused from my somewhat hard couch i felt my brain freed my mind clear i then began an attentive examination of our cell nothing was changed inside the prison was still a prisonthe prisoners prisoners however the steward during our sleep had cleared the table i breathed with difficulty the heavy air seemed to oppress my lungs although the cell was large we had evidently consumed a great part of the oxygen that it contained indeed each man consumes in one hour the oxygen contained in more than pints of air and this air charged as then with a nearly equal quantity of carbonic acid becomes unbreathable it became necessary to renew the atmosphere of our prison and no doubt the whole in the submarine boat that gave rise to a question in my mind how would the commander of this floating dwellingplace proceed would he obtain air by chemical means in getting by heat the oxygen contained in chlorate of potash and in absorbing carbonic acid by caustic potash or a more convenient economical and consequently more probable alternative would he be satisfied to rise and take breath at the surface of the water like a cetacean and so renew for twentyfour hours the atmospheric provision in fact i was already obliged to increase my respirations to eke out of this cell the little oxygen it contained when suddenly i was refreshed by a current of pure air and perfumed with saline emanations it was an invigorating sea breeze charged with iodine i opened my mouth wide and my lungs saturated themselves with fresh particles at the same time i felt the boat rolling the ironplated monster had evidently just risen to the surface of the ocean to breathe after the fashion of whales i found out from that the mode of ventilating the boat when i had inhaled this air freely i sought the conduitpipe which conveyed to us the beneficial whiff and i was not long in finding it above the door was a ventilator through which volumes of fresh air renewed the impoverished atmosphere of the cell i was making my observations when ned and conseil awoke almost at the same time under the influence of this reviving air they rubbed their eyes stretched themselves and were on their feet in an instant did master sleep well asked conseil with his usual politeness very well my brave boy and you mr land soundly professor but i dont know if i am right or not there seems to be a sea breeze a seaman could not be mistaken and i told the canadian all that had passed during his sleep good said he that accounts for those roarings we heard when the supposed narwhal sighted the _abraham lincoln_ quite so master land it was taking breath only m aronnax i have no idea what oclock it is unless it is dinnertime dinnertime my good fellow say rather breakfasttime for we certainly have begun another day so said conseil we have slept twentyfour hours that is my opinion i will not contradict you replied ned land but dinner or breakfast the steward will be welcome whichever he brings master land we must conform to the rules on board and i suppose our appetites are in advance of the dinner hour that is just like you friend conseil said ned impatiently you are never out of temper always calm you would return thanks before grace and die of hunger rather than complain time was getting on and we were fearfully hungry and this time the steward did not appear it was rather too long to leave us if they really had good intentions towards us ned land tormented by the cravings of hunger got still more angry and notwithstanding his promise i dreaded an explosion when he found himself with one of the crew for two hours more ned lands temper increased he cried he shouted but in vain the walls were deaf there was no sound to be heard in the boat all was still as death it did not move for i should have felt the trembling motion of the hull under the influence of the screw plunged in the depths of the waters it belonged no longer to earththis silence was dreadful i felt terrified conseil was calm ned land roared just then a noise was heard outside steps sounded on the metal flags the locks were turned the door opened and the steward appeared before i could rush forward to stop him the canadian had thrown him down and held him by the throat the steward was choking under the grip of his powerful hand conseil was already trying to unclasp the harpooners hand from his halfsuffocated victim and i was going to fly to the rescue when suddenly i was nailed to the spot by hearing these words in french be quiet master land and you professor will you be so good as to listen to me chapter x the man of the seas it was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke at these words ned land rose suddenly the steward nearly strangled tottered out on a sign from his master but such was the power of the commander on board that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which this man must have felt towards the canadian conseil interested in spite of himself i stupefied awaited in silence the result of this scene the commander leaning against the corner of a table with his arms folded scanned us with profound attention did he hesitate to speak did he regret the words which he had just spoken in french one might almost think so after some moments of silence which not one of us dreamed of breaking gentlemen said he in a calm and penetrating voice i speak french english german and latin equally well i could therefore have answered you at our first interview but i wished to know you first then to reflect the story told by each one entirely agreeing in the main points convinced me of your identity i know now that chance has brought before me m pierre aronnax professor of natural history at the museum of paris entrusted with a scientific mission abroad conseil his servant and ned land of canadian origin harpooner on board the frigate _abraham lincoln_ of the navy of the united states of america i bowed assent it was not a question that the commander put to me therefore there was no answer to be made this man expressed himself with perfect ease without any accent his sentences were well turned his words clear and his fluency of speech remarkable yet i did not recognise in him a fellowcountryman he continued the conversation in these terms you have doubtless thought sir that i have delayed long in paying you this second visit the reason is that your identity recognised i wished to weigh maturely what part to act towards you i have hesitated much most annoying circumstances have brought you into the presence of a man who has broken all the ties of humanity you have come to trouble my existence unintentionally said i unintentionally replied the stranger raising his voice a little was it unintentionally that the _abraham lincoln_ pursued me all over the seas was it unintentionally that you took passage in this frigate was it unintentionally that your cannon balls rebounded off the plating of my vessel was it unintentionally that mr ned land struck me with his harpoon i detected a restrained irritation in these words but to these recriminations i had a very natural answer to make and i made it sir said i no doubt you are ignorant of the discussions which have taken place concerning you in america and europe you do not know that divers accidents caused by collisions with your submarine machine have excited public feeling in the two continents i omit the hypotheses without number by which it was sought to explain the inexplicable phenomenon of which you alone possess the secret but you must understand that in pursuing you over the high seas of the pacific the _abraham lincoln_ believed itself to be chasing some powerful seamonster of which it was necessary to rid the ocean at any price a halfsmile curled the lips of the commander then in a calmer tone m aronnax he replied dare you affirm that your frigate would not as soon have pursued and cannonaded a submarine boat as a monster this question embarrassed me for certainly captain farragut might not have hesitated he might have thought it his duty to destroy a contrivance of this kind as he would a gigantic narwhal you understand then sir continued the stranger that i have the right to treat you as enemies i answered nothing purposely for what good would it be to discuss such a proposition when force could destroy the best arguments i have hesitated some time continued the commander nothing obliged me to show you hospitality if i chose to separate myself from you i should have no interest in seeing you again i could place you upon the deck of this vessel which has served you as a refuge i could sink beneath the waters and forget that you had ever existed would not that be my right it might be the right of a savage i answered but not that of a civilised man professor replied the commander quickly i am not what you call a civilised man i have done with society entirely for reasons which i alone have the right of appreciating i do not therefore obey its laws and i desire you never to allude to them before me again this was said plainly a flash of anger and disdain kindled in the eyes of the unknown and i had a glimpse of a terrible past in the life of this man not only had he put himself beyond the pale of human laws but he had made himself independent of them free in the strictest acceptation of the word quite beyond their reach who then would dare to pursue him at the bottom of the sea when on its surface he defied all attempts made against him what vessel could resist the shock of his submarine monitor what cuirass however thick could withstand the blows of his spur no man could demand from him an account of his actions god if he believed in onehis conscience if he had onewere the sole judges to whom he was answerable these reflections crossed my mind rapidly whilst the stranger personage was silent absorbed and as if wrapped up in himself i regarded him with fear mingled with interest as doubtless œdipus regarded the sphinx after rather a long silence the commander resumed the conversation i have hesitated said he but i have thought that my interest might be reconciled with that pity to which every human being has a right you will remain on board my vessel since fate has cast you there you will be free and in exchange for this liberty i shall only impose one single condition your word of honour to submit to it will suffice speak sir i answered i suppose this condition is one which a man of honour may accept yes sir it is this it is possible that certain events unforeseen may oblige me to consign you to your cabins for some hours or some days as the case may be as i desire never to use violence i expect from you more than all the others a passive obedience in thus acting i take all the responsibility i acquit you entirely for i make it an impossibility for you to see what ought not to be seen do you accept this condition then things took place on board which to say the least were singular and which ought not to be seen by people who were not placed beyond the pale of social laws amongst the surprises which the future was preparing for me this might not be the least we accept i answered only i will ask your permission sir to address one question to youone only speak sir you said that we should be free on board entirely i ask you then what you mean by this liberty just the liberty to go to come to see to observe even all that passes heresave under rare circumstancesthe liberty in short which we enjoy ourselves my companions and i it was evident that we did not understand one another pardon me sir i resumed but this liberty is only what every prisoner has of pacing his prison it cannot suffice us it must suffice you however what we must renounce for ever seeing our country our friends our relations again yes sir but to renounce that unendurable worldly yoke which men believe to be liberty is not perhaps so painful as you think well exclaimed ned land never will i give my word of honour not to try to escape i did not ask you for your word of honour master land answered the commander coldly sir i replied beginning to get angry in spite of myself you abuse your situation towards us it is cruelty no sir it is clemency you are my prisoners of war i keep you when i could by a word plunge you into the depths of the ocean you attacked me you came to surprise a secret which no man in the world must penetratethe secret of my whole existence and you think that i am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more never in retaining you it is not you whom i guardit is myself these words indicated a resolution taken on the part of the commander against which no arguments would prevail so sir i rejoined you give us simply the choice between life and death simply my friends said i to a question thus put there is nothing to answer but no word of honour binds us to the master of this vessel none sir answered the unknown then in a gentler tone he continued now permit me to finish what i have to say to you i know you m aronnax you and your companions will not perhaps have so much to complain of in the chance which has bound you to my fate you will find amongst the books which are my favourite study the work which you have published on the depths of the sea i have often read it you have carried out your work as far as terrestrial science permitted you but you do not know allyou have not seen all let me tell you then professor that you will not regret the time passed on board my vessel you are going to visit the land of marvels these words of the commander had a great effect upon me i cannot deny it my weak point was touched and i forgot for a moment that the contemplation of these sublime subjects was not worth the loss of liberty besides i trusted to the future to decide this grave question so i contented myself with saying by what name ought i to address you sir replied the commander i am nothing to you but captain nemo and you and your companions are nothing to me but the passengers of the _nautilus_ captain nemo called a steward appeared the captain gave him his orders in that strange language which i did not understand then turning towards the canadian and conseil a repast awaits you in your cabin said he be so good as to follow this man and now m aronnax our breakfast is ready permit me to lead the way i am at your service captain i followed captain nemo and as soon as i had passed through the door i found myself in a kind of passage lighted by electricity similar to the waist of a ship after we had proceeded a dozen yards a second door opened before me i then entered a diningroom decorated and furnished in severe taste high oaken sideboards inlaid with ebony stood at the two extremities of the room and upon their shelves glittered china porcelain and glass of inestimable value the plate on the table sparkled in the rays which the luminous ceiling shed around while the light was tempered and softened by exquisite paintings in the centre of the room was a table richly laid out captain nemo indicated the place i was to occupy the breakfast consisted of a certain number of dishes the contents of which were furnished by the sea alone and i was ignorant of the nature and mode of preparation of some of them i acknowledged that they were good but they had a peculiar flavour which i easily became accustomed to these different aliments appeared to me to be rich in phosphorus and i thought they must have a marine origin captain nemo looked at me i asked him no questions but he guessed my thoughts and answered of his own accord the questions which i was burning to address to him the greater part of these dishes are unknown to you he said to me however you may partake of them without fear they are wholesome and nourishing for a long time i have renounced the food of the earth and am never ill now my crew who are healthy are fed on the same food so said i all these eatables are the produce of the sea yes professor the sea supplies all my wants sometimes i cast my nets in tow and i draw them in ready to break sometimes i hunt in the midst of this element which appears to be inaccessible to man and quarry the game which dwells in my submarine forests my flocks like those of neptunes old shepherds graze fearlessly in the immense prairies of the ocean i have a vast property there which i cultivate myself and which is always sown by the hand of the creator of all things i can understand perfectly sir that your nets furnish excellent fish for your table i can understand also that you hunt aquatic game in your submarine forests but i cannot understand at all how a particle of meat no matter how small can figure in your bill of fare this which you believe to be meat professor is nothing else than fillet of turtle here are also some dolphins livers which you take to be ragout of pork my cook is a clever fellow who excels in dressing these various products of the ocean taste all these dishes here is a preserve of holothuria which a malay would declare to be unrivalled in the world here is a cream of which the milk has been furnished by the cetacea and the sugar by the great fucus of the north sea and lastly permit me to offer you some preserve of anemones which is equal to that of the most delicious fruits i tasted more from curiosity than as a connoisseur whilst captain nemo enchanted me with his extraordinary stories you like the sea captain yes i love it the sea is everything it covers seventenths of the terrestrial globe its breath is pure and healthy it is an immense desert where man is never lonely for he feels life stirring on all sides the sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful existence it is nothing but love and emotion it is the living infinite as one of your poets has said in fact professor nature manifests herself in it by her three kingdoms mineral vegetable and animal the sea is the vast reservoir of nature the globe began with sea so to speak and who knows if it will not end with it in it is supreme tranquillity the sea does not belong to despots upon its surface men can still exercise unjust laws fight tear one another to pieces and be carried away with terrestrial horrors but at thirty feet below its level their reign ceases their influence is quenched and their power disappears ah sir livelive in the bosom of the waters there only is independence there i recognise no masters there i am free captain nemo suddenly became silent in the midst of this enthusiasm by which he was quite carried away for a few moments he paced up and down much agitated then he became more calm regained his accustomed coldness of expression and turning towards me now professor said he if you wish to go over the _nautilus_ i am at your service captain nemo rose i followed him a double door contrived at the back of the diningroom opened and i entered a room equal in dimensions to that which i had just quitted it was a library high pieces of furniture of black violet ebony inlaid with brass supported upon their wide shelves a great number of books uniformly bound they followed the shape of the room terminating at the lower part in huge divans covered with brown leather which were curved to afford the greatest comfort light movable desks made to slide in and out at will allowed one to rest ones book while reading in the centre stood an immense table covered with pamphlets amongst which were some newspapers already of old date the electric light flooded everything it was shed from four unpolished globes half sunk in the volutes of the ceiling i looked with real admiration at this room so ingeniously fitted up and i could scarcely believe my eyes captain nemo said i to my host who had just thrown himself on one of the divans this is a library which would do honour to more than one of the continental palaces and i am absolutely astounded when i consider that it can follow you to the bottom of the seas where could one find greater solitude or silence professor replied captain nemo did your study in the museum afford you such perfect quiet no sir and i must confess that it is a very poor one after yours you must have six or seven thousand volumes here twelve thousand m aronnax these are the only ties which bind me to the earth but i had done with the world on the day when my _nautilus_ plunged for the first time beneath the waters that day i bought my last volumes my last pamphlets my last papers and from that time i wish to think that men no longer think or write these books professor are at your service besides and you can make use of them freely i thanked captain nemo and went up to the shelves of the library works on science morals and literature abounded in every language but i did not see one single work on political economy that subject appeared to be strictly proscribed strange to say all these books were irregularly arranged in whatever language they were written and this medley proved that the captain of the _nautilus_ must have read indiscriminately the books which he took up by chance sir said i to the captain i thank you for having placed this library at my disposal it contains treasures of science and i shall profit by them this room is not only a library said captain nemo it is also a smokingroom a smokingroom i cried then one may smoke on board certainly then sir i am forced to believe that you have kept up a communication with havannah not any answered the captain accept this cigar m aronnax and though it does not come from havannah you will be pleased with it if you are a connoisseur i took the cigar which was offered me its shape recalled the london ones but it seemed to be made of leaves of gold i lighted it at a little brazier which was supported upon an elegant bronze stem and drew the first whiffs with the delight of a lover of smoking who has not smoked for two days it is excellent but it is not tobacco no answered the captain this tobacco comes neither from havannah nor from the east it is a kind of seaweed rich in nicotine with which the sea provides me but somewhat sparingly at that moment captain nemo opened a door which stood opposite to that by which i had entered the library and i passed into an immense drawingroom splendidly lighted it was a vast foursided room thirty feet long eighteen wide and fifteen high a luminous ceiling decorated with light arabesques shed a soft clear light over all the marvels accumulated in this museum for it was in fact a museum in which an intelligent and prodigal hand had gathered all the treasures of nature and art with the artistic confusion which distinguishes a painters studio thirty firstrate pictures uniformly framed separated by bright drapery ornamented the walls which were hung with tapestry of severe design i saw works of great value the greater part of which i had admired in the special collections of europe and in the exhibitions of paintings the several schools of the old masters were represented by a madonna of raphael a virgin of leonardo da vinci a nymph of corregio a woman of titan an adoration of veronese an assumption of murillo a portrait of holbein a monk of velasquez a martyr of ribera a fair of rubens two flemish landscapes of teniers three little genre pictures of gerard dow metsu and paul potter two specimens of géricault and prudhon and some seapieces of backhuysen and vernet amongst the works of modern painters were pictures with the signatures of delacroix ingres decamps troyon meissonier daubigny etc and some admirable statues in marble and bronze after the finest antique models stood upon pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum amazement as the captain of the _nautilus_ had predicted had already begun to take possession of me professor said this strange man you must excuse the unceremonious way in which i receive you and the disorder of this room sir i answered without seeking to know who you are i recognise in you an artist an amateur nothing more sir formerly i loved to collect these beautiful works created by the hand of man i sought them greedily and ferreted them out indefatigably and i have been able to bring together some objects of great value these are my last souvenirs of that world which is dead to me in my eyes your modern artists are already old they have two or three thousand years of existence i confound them in my own mind masters have no age and these musicians said i pointing out some works of weber rossini mozart beethoven haydn meyerbeer hérold wagner auber gounod and a number of others scattered over a large model pianoorgan which occupied one of the panels of the drawingroom these musicians replied captain nemo are the contemporaries of orpheus for in the memory of the dead all chronological differences are effaced and i am dead professor as much dead as those of your friends who are sleeping six feet under the earth captain nemo was silent and seemed lost in a profound reverie i contemplated him with deep interest analysing in silence the strange expression of his countenance leaning on his elbow against an angle of a costly mosaic table he no longer saw mehe had forgotten my presence i did not disturb this reverie and continued my observation of the curiosities which enriched this drawingroom under elegant glass cases fixed by copper rivets were classed and labelled the most precious productions of the sea which had ever been presented to the eye of a naturalist my delight as a professor may be conceived the division containing the zoophytes presented the most curious specimens of the two groups of polypi and echinodermes in the first group the tubipores were gorgones arranged like a fan soft sponges of syria ises of the moluccas pennatules an admirable virgularia of the norwegian seas variegated unbellulairæ alcyonariæ a whole series of madrepores which my master milne edwards has so cleverly classified amongst which i remarked some wonderful flabellinæ oculinæ of the island of bourbon the neptunes car of the antilles superb varieties of coralsin short every species of those curious polypi of which entire islands are formed which will one day become continents of the echinodermes remarkable for their coating of spines asteri seastars pantacrinæ comatules astérophons echini holothuri etc represented individually a complete collection of this group a somewhat nervous conchyliologist would certainly have fainted before other more numerous cases in which were classified the specimens of molluscs it was a collection of inestimable value which time fails me to describe minutely amongst these specimens i will quote from memory only the elegant royal hammerfish of the indian ocean whose regular white spots stood out brightly on a red and brown ground an imperial spondyle brightcoloured bristling with spines a rare specimen in the european museumsi estimated its value at not less than a common hammerfish of the seas of new holland which is only procured with difficulty exotic buccardia of senegal fragile white bivalve shells which a breath might shatter like a soapbubble several varieties of the aspirgillum of java a kind of calcareous tube edged with leafy folds and much debated by amateurs a whole series of trochi some a greenishyellow found in the american seas others a reddishbrown natives of australian waters others from the gulf of mexico remarkable for their imbricated shell stellari found in the southern seas and last the rarest of all the magnificent spur of new zealand and every description of delicate and fragile shells to which science has given appropriate names apart in separate compartments were spread out chaplets of pearls of the greatest beauty which reflected the electric light in little sparks of fire pink pearls torn from the pinnamarina of the red sea green pearls of the haliotyde iris yellow blue and black pearls the curious productions of the divers molluscs of every ocean and certain mussels of the watercourses of the north lastly several specimens of inestimable value which had been gathered from the rarest pintadines some of these pearls were larger than a pigeons egg and were worth as much and more than that which the traveller tavernier sold to the shah of persia for three millions and surpassed the one in the possession of the imaum of muscat which i had believed to be unrivalled in the world therefore to estimate the value of this collection was simply impossible captain nemo must have expended millions in the acquirement of these various specimens and i was thinking what source he could have drawn from to have been able thus to gratify his fancy for collecting when i was interrupted by these words you are examining my shells professor unquestionably they must be interesting to a naturalist but for me they have a far greater charm for i have collected them all with my own hand and there is not a sea on the face of the globe which has escaped my researches i can understand captain the delight of wandering about in the midst of such riches you are one of those who have collected their treasures themselves no museum in europe possesses such a collection of the produce of the ocean but if i exhaust all my admiration upon it i shall have none left for the vessel which carries it i do not wish to pry into your secrets but i must confess that this _nautilus_ with the motive power which is confined in it the contrivances which enable it to be worked the powerful agent which propels it all excite my curiosity to the highest pitch i see suspended on the walls of this room instruments of whose use i am ignorant you will find these same instruments in my own room professor where i shall have much pleasure in explaining their use to you but first come and inspect the cabin which is set apart for your own use you must see how you will be accommodated on board the _nautilus_ i followed captain nemo who by one of the doors opening from each panel of the drawingroom regained the waist he conducted me towards the bow and there i found not a cabin but an elegant room with a bed dressingtable and several other pieces of furniture i could only thank my host your room adjoins mine said he opening a door and mine opens into the drawingroom that we have just quitted i entered the captains room it had a severe almost a monkish aspect a small iron bedstead a table some articles for the toilet the whole lighted by a skylight no comforts the strictest necessaries only captain nemo pointed to a seat be so good as to sit down he said i seated myself and he began thus illustration captain nemos stateroom chapter xi all by electricity sir said captain nemo showing me the instruments hanging on the walls of his room here are the contrivances required for the navigation of the _nautilus_ here as in the drawingroom i have them always under my eyes and they indicate my position and exact direction in the middle of the ocean some are known to you such as the thermometer which gives the internal temperature of the _nautilus_ the barometer which indicates the weight of the air and foretells the changes of the weather the hygrometer which marks the dryness of the atmosphere the stormglass the contents of which by decomposing announce the approach of tempests the compass which guides my course the sextant which shows the latitude by the altitude of the sun chronometers by which i calculate the longitude and glasses for day and night which i use to examine the points of the horizon when the _nautilus_ rises to the surface of the waves these are the usual nautical instruments i replied and i know the use of them but these others no doubt answer to the particular requirements of the _nautilus_ this dial with the movable needle is a manometer is it not it is actually a manometer but by communication with the water whose external pressure it indicates it gives our depth at the same time and these other instruments the use of which i cannot guess here professor i ought to give you some explanations will you be kind enough to listen to me he was silent for a few moments then he said there is a powerful agent obedient rapid easy which conforms to every use and reigns supreme on board my vessel everything is done by means of it it lights it warms it and is the soul of my mechanical apparatus this agent is electricity electricity i cried in surprise yes sir nevertheless captain you possess an extreme rapidity of movement which does not agree with the power of electricity until now its dynamic force has remained under restraint and has only been able to produce a small amount of power professor said captain nemo my electricity is not everybodys you know what seawater is composed of in a thousand grammes are found ½ per cent of water and about per cent of chloride of sodium then in a smaller quantity chlorides of magnesium and of potassium bromide of magnesium sulphate of magnesia sulphate and carbonate of lime you see then that chloride of sodium forms a large part of it so it is this sodium that i extract from seawater and of which i compose my ingredients i owe all to the ocean it produces electricity and electricity gives heat light motion and in a word life to the _nautilus_ but not the air you breathe oh i could manufacture the air necessary for my consumption but it is useless because i go up to the surface of the water when i please however if electricity does not furnish me with air to breathe it works at least the powerful pumps that are stored in spacious reservoirs and which enable me to prolong at need and as long as i will my stay in the depths of the sea it gives a uniform and unintermittent light which the sun does not now look at this clock it is electrical and goes with a regularity that defies the best chronometers i have divided it into twentyfour hours like the italian clocks because for me there is neither night nor day sun nor moon but only that factitious light that i take with me to the bottom of the sea look just now it is ten oclock in the morning exactly another application of electricity this dial hanging in front of us indicates the speed of the _nautilus_ an electric thread puts it in communication with the screw and the needle indicates the real speed look now we are spinning along with a uniform speed of fifteen miles an hour it is marvelous and i see captain you were right to make use of this agent that takes the place of wind water and steam we have not finished m aronnax said captain nemo rising if you will follow me we will examine the stern of the _nautilus_ really i knew already the anterior part of this submarine boat of which this is the exact division starting from the ships headthe diningroom five yards long separated from the library by a watertight partition the library five yards long the large drawingroom ten yards long separated from the captains room by a second watertight partition the said room five yards in length mine two and a half yards and lastly a reservoir of air seven and a half yards that extended to the bows total length thirtyfive yards or one hundred and five feet the partitions had doors that were shut hermetically by means of indiarubber instruments and they ensured the safety of the _nautilus_ in case of a leak i followed captain nemo through the waist and arrived at the centre of the boat there was a sort of well that opened between two partitions an iron ladder fastened with an iron hook to the partition led to the upper end i asked the captain what the ladder was used for it leads to the small boat he said what have you a boat i exclaimed in surprise of course an excellent vessel light and insubmersible that serves either as a fishing or as a pleasure boat but then when you wish to embark you are obliged to come to the surface of the water not at all this boat is attached to the upper part of the hull of the _nautilus_ and occupies a cavity made for it it is decked quite watertight and held together by solid bolts this ladder leads to a manhole made in the hull of the _nautilus_ that corresponds with a similar hole made in the side of the boat by this double opening i get into the small vessel they shut the one belonging to the _nautilus_ i shut the other by means of screw pressure i undo the bolts and the little boat goes up to the surface of the sea with prodigious rapidity i then open the panel of the bridge carefully shut till then i mast it hoist my sail take my oars and im off but how do you get back on board i do not come back m aronnax the _nautilus_ comes to me by your orders by my orders an electric thread connects us i telegraph to it and that is enough really i said astonished at these marvels nothing can be more simple after having passed by the cage of the staircase that led to the platform i saw a cabin six feet long in which conseil and ned land enchanted with their repast were devouring it with avidity then a door opened into a kitchen nine feet long situated between the large storerooms there electricity better than gas itself did all the cooking the streams under the furnaces gave out to the sponges of platina a heat which was regularly kept up and distributed they also heated a distilling apparatus which by evaporation furnished excellent drinkable water near this kitchen was a bathroom comfortably furnished with hot and cold water taps next to the kitchen was the berthroom of the vessel sixteen feet long but the door was shut and i could not see the management of it which might have given me an idea of the number of men employed on board the _nautilus_ at the bottom was a fourth partition that separated this office from the engineroom a door opened and i found myself in the compartment where captain nemocertainly an engineer of a very high orderhad arranged his locomotive machinery this engineroom clearly lighted did not measure less than sixtyfive feet in length it was divided into two parts the first contained the materials for producing electricity and the second the machinery that connected it with the screw i examined it with great interest in order to understand the machinery of the _nautilus_ you see said the captain i use bunsens contrivances not ruhmkorffs those would not have been powerful enough bunsens are fewer in number but strong and large which experience proves to be the best the electricity produced passes forward where it works by electromagnets of great size on a system of levers and cogwheels that transmit the movement to the axle of the screw this one the diameter of which is nineteen feet and the thread twentythree feet performs about a hundred and twenty revolutions in a second and you get then a speed of fifty miles an hour i have seen the _nautilus_ manœuvre before the _abraham lincoln_ and i have my own ideas as to its speed but this is not enough we must see where we go we must be able to direct it to the right to the left above below how do you get to the great depths where you find an increasing resistance which is rated by hundreds of atmospheres how do you return to the surface of the ocean and how do you maintain yourselves in the requisite medium am i asking too much not at all professor replied the captain with some hesitation since you may never leave this submarine boat come into the saloon it is our usual study and there you will learn all you want to know about the _nautilus_ chapter xii some figures a moment after we were seated on a divan in the saloon smoking the captain showed me a sketch that gave the plan section and elevation of the _nautilus_ then he began his description in these words here m aronnax are the several dimensions of the boat you are in it is an elongated cylinder with conical ends it is very like a cigar in shape a shape already adopted in london in several constructions of the same sort the length of this cylinder from stem to stern is exactly feet and its maximum breadth is twentysix feet it is not built quite like your longvoyage steamers but its lines are sufficiently long and its curves prolonged enough to allow the water to slide off easily and oppose no obstacle to its passage these two dimensions enable you to obtain by a simple calculation the surface and cubic contents of the _nautilus_ its area measures feet and its contents about cubic yardsthat is to say when completely immersed it displaces feet of water or weighs tons when i made the plans for this submarine vessel i meant that ninetenths should be submerged consequently it ought only to displace ninetenths of its bulkthat is to say only to weigh that number of tons i ought not therefore to have exceeded that weight constructing it on the aforesaid dimensions the _nautilus_ is composed of two hulls one inside the other outside joined by tshaped irons which render it very strong indeed owing to this cellular arrangement it resists like a block as if it were solid its sides cannot yield it coheres spontaneously and not by the closeness of its rivets and the homogenity of its construction due to the perfect union of the materials enables it to defy the roughest seas these two hulls are composed of steel plates whose density is from to that of water the first is not less than two inches and a half thick and weighs tons the second envelope the keel twenty inches high and ten thick weighs alone sixtytwo tons the engine the ballast the several accessories and apparatus appendages the partitions and bulkheads weigh tons do you follow all this i do then when the _nautilus_ is afloat under these circumstances onetenth is out of the water now if i have made reservoirs of a size equal to this tenth or capable of holding tons and if i fill them with water the boat weighing then tons will be completely immersed that would happen professor these reservoirs are in the lower parts of the _nautilus_ i turn on taps and they fill and the vessel sinks that had just been level with the surface well captain but now we come to the real difficulty i can understand your rising to the surface but diving below the surface does not your submarine contrivance encounter a pressure and consequently undergo an upward thrust of one atmosphere for every thirty feet of water just about fifteen pounds per square inch just so sir then unless you quite fill the _nautilus_ i do not see how you can draw it down to those depths professor you must not confound statics with dynamics or you will be exposed to grave errors there is very little labour spent in attaining the lower regions of the ocean for all bodies have a tendency to sink when i wanted to find out the necessary increase of weight required to sink the _nautilus_ i had only to calculate the reduction of volume that seawater acquires according to the depth that is evident now if water is not absolutely incompressible it is at least capable of very slight compression indeed after the most recent calculations this reduction is only of an atmosphere for each thirty feet of depth if we want to sink feet i should keep account of the reduction of bulk under a pressure equal to that of a column of water of a thousand feet the calculation is easily verified now i have supplementary reservoirs capable of holding a hundred tons therefore i can sink to a considerable depth when i wish to rise to the level of the sea i only let off the water and empty all the reservoirs if i want the _nautilus_ to emerge from the tenth part of her total capacity i had nothing to object to these reasonings i admit your calculations captain i replied i should be wrong to dispute them since daily experience confirms them but i foresee a real difficulty in the way what sir when you are about feet deep the walls of the _nautilus_ bear a pressure of atmospheres if then just now you were to empty the supplementary reservoirs to lighten the vessel and to go up to the surface the pumps must overcome the pressure of atmospheres which is pounds per square inch from that a power that electricity alone can give said the captain hastily i repeat sir that the dynamic power of my engines is almost infinite the pumps of the _nautilus_ have an enormous power as you must have observed when their jets of water burst like a torrent upon the _abraham lincoln_ besides i use subsidiary reservoirs only to attain a mean depth of to fathoms and that with a view of managing my machines also when i have a mind to visit the depths of the ocean five or six miles below the surface i make use of slower but not less infallible means what are they captain that involves my telling you how the _nautilus_ is worked i am impatient to learn to steer this boat to starboard or port to turnin a word following a horizontal plan i use an ordinary rudder fixed on the back of the sternpost and with one wheel and some tackle to steer by but i can also make the _nautilus_ rise and sink and sink and rise by a vertical movement by means of two inclined planes fastened to its sides opposite the centre of flotation planes that move in every direction and that are worked by powerful levers from the interior if the planes are kept parallel with the boat it moves horizontally if slanted the _nautilus_ according to this inclination and under the influence of the screw either sinks diagonally or rises diagonally as it suits me and even if i wish to rise more quickly to the surface i ship the screw and the pressure of the water causes the _nautilus_ to rise vertically like a balloon filled with hydrogen bravo captain but how can the steersman follow the route in the middle of the waters the steersman is placed in a glazed box that is raised about the hull of the _nautilus_ and furnished with lenses are these lenses capable of resisting such pressure perfectly glass which breaks at a blow is nevertheless capable of offering considerable resistance during some experiments of fishing by electric light in in the northern seas we saw plates less than a third of an inch thick resist a pressure of sixteen atmospheres now the glass that i use is not less than thirty times thicker granted but after all in order to see the light must exceed the darkness and in the midst of the darkness in the water how can you see behind the steersmans cage is placed a powerful electric reflector the rays from which light up the sea for half a mile in front ah bravo bravo captain now i can account for this phosphorescence in the supposed narwhal that puzzled us so i now ask you if the boarding of the _nautilus_ and of the _scotia_ that has made such a noise has been the result of a chance rencontre quite accidental sir i was sailing only one fathom below the surface of the water when the shock came it had no bad result none sir but now about your rencontre with the _abraham lincoln_ professor i am sorry for one of the best vessels in the american navy but they attacked me and i was bound to defend myself i contented myself however with putting the frigate _hors de combat_ she will not have any difficulty in getting repaired at the next port ah commander your _nautilus_ is certainly a marvellous boat yes professor and i love it as if it were part of myself if danger threatens one of your vessels on the ocean the first impression is the feeling of an abyss above and below on the _nautilus_ mens hearts never fail them no defects to be afraid of for the double shell is as firm as iron no rigging to attend to no sails for the wind to carry away no boilers to burst no fire to fear for the vessel is made of iron not of wood no coal to run short for electricity is the only mechanical agent no collision to fear for it alone swims in deep water no tempest to brave for when it dives below the water it reaches absolute tranquillity there sir that is the perfection of vessels and if it is true that the engineer has more confidence in the vessel than the builder and the builder than the captain himself you understand the trust i repose in my _nautilus_ for i am at once captain builder and engineer but how could you construct this wonderful _nautilus_ in secret each separate portion m aronnax was brought from different parts of the globe the keel was forged at creusot the shaft of the screw at penn cos london the iron plates of the hull at lairds of liverpool the screw itself at scotts at glasgow the reservoirs were made by cail co at paris the engine by krupp in prussia its beak in motalas workshop in sweden its mathematical instruments by hart brothers of new york etc and each of these people had my orders under different names but these parts had to be put together and arranged professor i had set up my workshops upon a desert island in the ocean there my workmen that is to say the brave men that i instructed and educated and myself have put together our _nautilus_ then when the work was finished fire destroyed all trace of our proceedings on this island that i could have jumped over if i had liked then the cost of this vessel is great m aronnax an iron vessel costs per ton now the _nautilus_ weighed it came therefore to and more for fitting it up and about with the works of art and the collections it contains one last question captain nemo ask it professor you are rich immensely rich sir and i could without missing it pay the national debt of france i stared at the singular person who spoke thus was he playing upon my credulity the future would decide that chapter xiii the black river the portion of the terrestrial globe which is covered by water is estimated at upwards of eighty millions of acres this fluid mass comprises two billions two hundred and fifty millions of cubic miles forming a spherical body of a diameter of sixty leagues the weight of which would be three quintillions of tons to comprehend the meaning of these figures it is necessary to observe that a quintillion is to a billion as a billion is to unity in other words there are as many billions in a quintillion as there are units in a billion this mass of fluid is equal to about the quantity of water which would be discharged by all the rivers of the earth in forty thousand years during the geological epochs the igneous period succeeded to the aqeous the ocean originally prevailed everywhere then by degrees in the silurian period the tops of the mountains began to appear the islands emerged then disappeared in partial deluges reappeared became settled formed continents till at length the earth became geographically arranged as we see in the present day the solid had wrested from the liquid thirtyseven million six hundred and fiftyseven square miles equal to twelve billion nine hundred and sixty millions of acres the shape of continents allows us to divide the waters into five great portions the arctic or frozen ocean the antarctic or frozen ocean the indian the atlantic and the pacific oceans the pacific ocean extends from north to south between the two polar circles and from east to west between asia and america over an extent of degrees of longitude it is the quietest of seas its currents are broad and slow it has medium tides and abundant rain such was the ocean that my fate destined me first to travel over under these strange conditions sir said captain nemo we will if you please take our bearings and fix the startingpoint of this voyage it is a quarter to twelve i will go up again to the surface the captain pressed an electric clock three times the pumps began to drive the water from the tanks the needle of the manometer marked by a different pressure the ascent of the _nautilus_ then it stopped we have arrived said the captain i went to the central staircase which opened on to the platform clambered up the iron steps and found myself on the upper part of the _nautilus_ the platform was only three feet out of water the front and back of the _nautilus_ was of that spindleshape which caused it justly to be compared to a cigar i noticed that its iron plates slightly overlaying each other resembled the shell which clothes the bodies of our large terrestrial reptiles it explained to me how natural it was in spite of all glasses that this boat should have been taken for a marine animal toward the middle of the platform the longboat half buried in the hull of the vessel formed a slight excrescence fore and aft rose two cages of medium height with inclined sides and partly closed by thick lenticular glasses one destined for the steersman who directed the _nautilus_ the other containing a brilliant lantern to give light on the road the sea was beautiful the sky pure scarcely could the long vehicle feel the broad undulations of the ocean a light breeze from the east rippled the surface of the waters the horizon free from fog made observation easy nothing was in sight not a quicksand not an island a vast desert captain nemo by the help of his sextant took the altitude of the sun which ought also to give the latitude he waited for some moments till its disc touched the horizon whilst taking observations not a muscle moved the instrument could not have been more motionless in a hand of marble illustration captain nemo took the suns altitude twelve oclock sir said he when you like i cast a last look upon the sea slightly yellowed by the japanese coast and descended to the saloon and now sir i leave you to your studies added the captain our course is ene our depth is twentysix fathoms here are maps on a large scale by which you may follow it the saloon is at your disposal and with your permission i will retire captain nemo bowed and i remained alone lost in thoughts all bearing on the commander of the _nautilus_ for a whole hour was i deep in these reflections seeking to pierce this mystery so interesting to me then my eyes fell upon the vast planisphere spread upon the table and i placed my finger on the very spot where the given latitude and longitude crossed the sea has its large rivers like the continents they are special currents known by their temperature and their colour the most remarkable of these is known by the name of the gulf stream science has decided on the globe the direction of five principal currents one in the north atlantic a second in the south a third in the north pacific a fourth in the south and a fifth in the southern indian ocean it is even probable that a sixth current existed at one time or another in the northern indian ocean when the caspian and aral seas formed but one vast sheet of water at this point indicated on the planisphere one of these currents was rolling the kuroscivo of the japanese the black river which leaving the gulf of bengal where it is warmed by the perpendicular rays of a tropical sun crosses the straits of malacca along the coast of asia turns into the north pacific to the aleutian islands carrying with it trunks of camphortrees and other indigenous productions and edging the waves of the ocean with the pure indigo of its warm water it was this current that the _nautilus_ was to follow i followed it with my eye saw it lose itself in the vastness of the pacific and felt myself drawn with it when ned land and conseil appeared at the door of the saloon my two brave companions remained petrified at the sight of the wonders spread before them where are we where are we exclaimed the canadian in the museum at quebec my friends i answered making a sign for them to enter you are not in canada but on board the _nautilus_ fifty yards below the level of the sea but m aronnax said ned land can you tell me how many men there are on board ten twenty fifty a hundred i cannot answer you mr land it is better to abandon for a time all idea of seizing the _nautilus_ or escaping from it this ship is a masterpiece of modern industry and i should be sorry not to have seen it many people would accept the situation forced upon us if only to move amongst such wonders so be quiet and let us try and see what passes around us see exclaimed the harpooner but we can see nothing in this iron prison we are walkingwe are sailingblindly ned land had scarcely pronounced these words when all was suddenly darkness the luminous ceiling was gone and so rapidly that my eyes received a painful impression we remained mute not stirring and not knowing what surprise awaited us whether agreeable or disagreeable a sliding noise was heard one would have said that panels were working at the sides of the _nautilus_ it is the end of the end said ned land suddenly light broke at each side of the saloon through two oblong openings the liquid mass appeared vividly lit up by the electric gleam two crystal plates separated us from the sea at first i trembled at the thought that this frail partition might break but strong bands of copper bound them giving an almost infinite power of resistance the sea was distinctly visible for a mile all round the _nautilus_ what a spectacle what pen can describe it who could paint the effects of the light through those transparent sheets of water and the softness of the successive graduations from the lower to the superior strata of the ocean we know the transparency of the sea and that its clearness is far beyond that of rockwater the mineral and organic substances which it holds in suspension heightens its transparency in certain parts of the ocean at the antilles under seventyfive fathoms of water can be seen with surprising clearness a bed of sand the penetrating power of the solar rays does not seem to cease for a depth of one hundred and fifty fathoms but in this middle fluid travelled over by the _nautilus_ the electric brightness was produced even in the bosom of the waves it was no longer luminous water but liquid light on each side a window opened into this unexplored abyss the obscurity of the saloon showed to advantage the brightness outside and we looked out as if this pure crystal had been the glass of an immense aquarium you wished to see friend ned well you see now curious curious muttered the canadian who forgetting his illtemper seemed to submit to some irresistible attraction and one would come further than this to admire such a sight ah thought i to myself i understand the life of this man he has made a world apart for himself in which he treasures all his greatest wonders for two whole hours an aquatic army escorted the _nautilus_ during their games their bounds while rivalling each other in beauty brightness and velocity i distinguished the green labre the banded mullet marked by a double line of black the roundtailed goby of a white colour with violet spots on the back the japanese scombrus a beautiful mackerel of those seas with a blue body and silvery head the brilliant azurors whose name alone defies description some banded spares with variegated fins of blue and yellow the woodcocks of the seas some specimens of which attain a yard in length japanese salamanders spider lampreys serpents six feet long with eyes small and lively and a huge mouth bristling with teeth with many other species our imagination was kept at its height interjections followed quickly on each other ned named the fish and conseil classed them i was in ecstasies with the vivacity of their movements and the beauty of their forms never had it been given to me to surprise these animals alive and at liberty in their natural element i will not mention all the varieties which passed before my dazzled eyes all the collection of the seas of china and japan these fish more numerous than the birds of the air came attracted no doubt by the brilliant focus of the electric light suddenly there was daylight in the saloon the iron panels closed again and the enchanting vision disappeared but for a long time i dreamt on till my eyes fell on the instruments hanging on the partition the compass still showed the course to be nne the manometer indicated a pressure of five atmospheres equivalent to a depth of twentyfive fathoms and the electric log gave a speed of fifteen miles an hour i expected captain nemo but he did not appear the clock marked the hour of five ned land and conseil returned to their cabin and i retired to my chamber my dinner was ready it was composed of turtle soup made of the most delicate hawksbills of a surmullet served with puff paste the liver of which prepared by itself was most delicious and fillets of the emperorholocanthus the savour of which seemed to me superior even to salmon i passed the evening reading writing and thinking then sleep overpowered me and i stretched myself on my couch of zostera and slept profoundly whilst the _nautilus_ was gliding rapidly through the current of the black river chapter xiv a note of invitation the next day was the th of november i awoke after a long sleep of twelve hours conseil came according to custom to know how i had passed the night and to offer his services he had left his friend the canadian sleeping like a man who had never done anything else all his life i let the worthy fellow chatter as he pleased without caring to answer him i was preoccupied by the absence of the captain during our sitting of the day before and hoping to see him today as soon as i was dressed i went into the saloon it was deserted i plunged into the study of the shell treasures hidden behind the glasses i revelled also in great herbals filled with the rarest marine plants which although dried up retained their lovely colours amongst these precious hydrophytes i remarked some vorticellæ pavonariæ delicate ceramies with scarlet tints some fanshaped agari and some natabuli like flat mushrooms which at one time used to be classed as zoophytes in short a perfect series of algæ the whole day passed without my being honoured by a visit from captain nemo the panels of the saloon did not open perhaps they did not wish us to tire of these beautiful things the course of the _nautilus_ was ene her speed twelve knots the depth below the surface between twentyfive and thirty fathoms the next day th of november the same desertion the same solitude i did not see one of the ships crew ned and conseil spent the greater part of the day with me they were astonished at the inexplicable absence of the captain was this singular man illhad he altered his intentions with regard to us after all as conseil said we enjoyed perfect liberty we were delicately and abundantly fed our host kept to his terms of the treaty we could not complain and indeed the singularity of our fate reserved such wonderful compensation for us that we had no right to accuse it as yet that day i commenced the journal of these adventures which has enabled me to relate them with more scrupulous exactitude and minute detail i wrote it on paper made from the zostera marina th november early in the morning the fresh air spreading over the interior of the _nautilus_ told me that we had come to the surface of the ocean to renew our supply of oxygen i directed my steps to the central staircase and mounted the platform it was six oclock the weather was cloudy the sea grey but calm scarcely a billow captain nemo whom i hoped to meet would he be there i saw no one but the steersman imprisoned in his glass cage seated upon the projection formed by the hull of the pinnace i inhaled the salt breeze with delight by degrees the fog disappeared under the action of the suns rays the radiant orb rose from behind the eastern horizon the sea flamed under its glance like a train of gunpowder the clouds scattered in the heights were coloured with lively tints of beautiful shades and numerous mares tails which betokened wind for that day but what was wind to this _nautilus_ which tempests could not frighten i was admiring this joyous rising of the sun so gay and so lifegiving when i heard steps approaching the platform i was prepared to salute captain nemo but it was his second whom i had already seen on the captains first visit who appeared he advanced on the platform not seeming to see me with his powerful glass to his eye he scanned every point of the horizon with great attention this examination over he approached the panel and pronounced a sentence in exactly these terms i have remembered it for every morning it was repeated under exactly the same conditions it was thus worded nautron respoc lorni virch what it meant i could not say these words pronounced the second descended i thought that the _nautilus_ was about to return to its submarine navigation i regained the panel and returned to my chamber five days sped thus without any change in our situation every morning i mounted the platform the same phrase was pronounced by the same individual but captain nemo did not appear i had made up my mind that i should never see him again when on the th november on returning to my room with ned and conseil i found upon my table a note addressed to me i opened it impatiently it was written in a bold clear hand the characters rather pointed recalling the german type the note was worded as follows th of _november_ to professor aronnax on board the _nautilus_ captain nemo invites professor aronnax to a huntingparty which will take place tomorrow morning in the forests of the island of crespo he hopes that nothing will prevent the professor from being present and he will with pleasure see him joined by his companions captain nemo commander of the _nautilus_ a hunt exclaimed ned and in the forests of the island of crespo added conseil oh then the gentleman is going on _terra firma_ replied ned land that seems to me to be clearly indicated said i reading the letter once more well we must accept said the canadian but once more on dry ground we shall know what to do indeed i shall not be sorry to eat a piece of fresh venison without seeking to reconcile what was contradictory between captain nemos manifest aversion to islands and continents and his invitation to hunt in a forest i contented myself with replying let us first see where the island of crespo is i consulted the planisphere and in north lat and west long i found a small island recognised in by captain crespo and marked in the ancient spanish maps as rocca de la plata the meaning of which is the silver rock we were then about eighteen hundred miles from our startingpoint and the course of the _nautilus_ a little changed was bringing it back towards the southeast i showed this little rock lost in the midst of the north pacific to my companions if captain nemo does sometimes go on dry ground said i he at least chooses desert islands ned land shrugged his shoulders without speaking and conseil and he left me after supper which was served by the steward mute and impassive i went to bed not without some anxiety the next morning the th of november on awakening i felt that the _nautilus_ was perfectly still i dressed quickly and entered the saloon captain nemo was there waiting for me he rose bowed and asked me if it was convenient for me to accompany him as he made no allusion to his absence during the last eight days i did not mention it and simply answered that my companions and myself were ready to follow him we entered the diningroom where breakfast was served m aronnax said the captain pray share my breakfast without ceremony we will chat as we eat for though i promised you a walk in the forest i did not undertake to find hotels there so breakfast as a man who will most likely not have his dinner till very late i did honour to the repast it was composed of several kinds of fish and slices of holothuridæ excellent zoophytes and different sorts of seaweed our drink consisted of pure water to which the captain added some drops of a fermented liquor extracted by the kamschatcha method from a seaweed known under the name of _rhodomenia palmata_ captain nemo ate at first without saying a word then he began sir when i proposed to you to hunt in my submarine forest of crespo you evidently thought me mad sir you should never judge lightly of any man but captain believe me be kind enough to listen and you will then see whether you have any cause to accuse me of folly and contradiction i listen you know as well as i do professor that man can live under water providing he carries with him a sufficient supply of breathable air in submarine works the workman clad in an impervious dress with his head in a metal helmet receives air from above by means of forcing pumps and regulators that is a diving apparatus said i just so but under these conditions the man is not at liberty he is attached to the pump which sends him air through an indiarubber tube and if we were obliged to be thus held to the _nautilus_ we could not go far and the means of getting free i asked it is to use the rouquayrol apparatus invented by two of your own countrymen which i have brought to perfection for my own use and which will allow you to risk yourself under these new physiological conditions without any organ whatever suffering it consists of a reservoir of thick iron plates in which i store the air under a pressure of fifty atmospheres this reservoir is fixed on the back by means of braces like a soldiers knapsack its upper part forms a box in which the air is kept by means of a bellows and therefore cannot escape unless at its normal tension in the rouquayrol apparatus such as we use two indiarubber pipes leave this box and join a sort of tent which holds the nose and mouth one is to introduce fresh air the other to let out the foul and the tongue closes one or the other according to the wants of the respirator but i in encountering great pressures at the bottom of the sea was obliged to shut my head like that of a diver in a ball of copper and it is to this ball of copper that the two pipes the inspirator and the expirator open perfectly captain nemo but the air that you carry with you must soon be used when it only contains fifteen per cent of oxygen it is no longer fit to breathe right but i told you m aronnax that the pumps of the _nautilus_ allow me to store the air under considerable pressure and on these conditions the reservoir of the apparatus can furnish breathable air for nine or ten hours i have no further objections to make i answered i will only ask you one thing captainhow can you light your road at the bottom of the sea with the ruhmkorff apparatus m aronnax one is carried on the back the other is fastened to the waist it is composed of a bunsen pile which i do not work with bichromate of potash but with sodium a wire is introduced which collects the electricity produced and directs it towards a particularly made lantern in this lantern is a spiral glass which contains a small quantity of carbonic gas when the apparatus is at work this gas becomes luminous giving out a white and continuous light thus provided i can breathe and i can see captain nemo to all my objections you make such crushing answers that i dare no longer doubt but if i am forced to admit the rouquayrol and ruhmkorff apparatus i must be allowed some reservations with regard to the gun i am to carry but it is not a gun for powder answered the captain then it is an airgun doubtless how would you have me manufacture gunpowder on board without either saltpetre sulphur or charcoal besides i added to fire under water in a medium eight hundred and fiftyfive times denser than the air we must conquer very considerable resistance that would be no difficulty there exist guns according to fulton perfected in england by philip coles and burley in france by furcy and in italy by landi which are furnished with a peculiar system of closing which can fire under these conditions but i repeat having no powder i use air under great pressure which the pumps of the _nautilus_ furnish abundantly but this air must be rapidly used well have i not my rouquayrol reservoir which can furnish it at need a tap is all that is required besides m aronnax you must see yourself that during our submarine hunt we can spend but little air and but few balls but it seems to me that in this twilight and in the midst of this fluid which is very dense compared with the atmosphere shots could not go far nor easily prove mortal sir on the contrary with this gun every blow is mortal and however lightly the animal is touched it falls as if struck by a thunderbolt why because the balls sent by this gun are not ordinary balls but little cases of glass invented by leniebroek an austrian chemist of which i have a large supply these glass cases are covered with a case of steel and weighted with a pellet of lead they are real leyden bottles into which the electricity is forced to a very high tension with the slightest shock they are discharged and the animal however strong it may be falls dead i must tell you that these cases are size number four and that the charge for an ordinary gun would be ten i will argue no longer i replied rising from the table i have nothing left me but to take my gun at all events i will go where you go captain nemo then led me aft and in passing before neds and conseils cabin i called my two companions who followed immediately we then came to a kind of cell near the machineryroom in which we were to put on our walkingdress chapter xv a walk on the bottom of the sea this cell was to speak correctly the arsenal and wardrobe of the _nautilus_ a dozen diving apparatuses hung from the partition waiting our use ned land on seeing them showed evident repugnance to dress himself in one but my worthy ned the forests of the island of crespo are nothing but submarine forests good said the disappointed harpooner who saw his dreams of fresh meat fade away and you m aronnax are you going to dress yourself in those clothes there is no alternative master ned as you please sir replied the harpooner shrugging his shoulders but as for me unless i am forced i will never get into one no one will force you master ned said captain nemo is conseil going to risk it asked ned i follow my master wherever he goes replied conseil at the captains call two of the ships crew came to help us to dress in these heavy and impervious clothes made of indiarubber without seam and constructed expressly to resist considerable pressure one would have thought it a suit of armour both supple and resisting this suit formed trousers and waistcoat the trousers were finished off with thick boots weighted with heavy leaden soles the texture of the waistcoat was held together by bands of copper which crossed the chest protecting it from the great pressure of the water and leaving the lungs free to act the sleeves ended in gloves which in no way restrained the movement of the hands there was a vast difference noticeable between these consummate apparatuses and the old cork breastplates jackets and other contrivances in vogue during the eighteenth century captain nemo and one of his companions a sort of hercules who must have possessed great strength conseil and myself were soon enveloped in the dresses there remained nothing more to be done but to enclose our heads in the metal box but before proceeding to this operation i asked the captains permission to examine the guns we were to carry one of the _nautilus_ men gave me a simple gun the butt end of which made of steel hollow in the centre was rather large it served as a reservoir for compressed air which a valve worked by a spring allowed to escape into a metal tube a box of projectiles in a groove in the thickness of the butt end contained about twenty of these electric balls which by means of a spring were forced into the barrel of the gun as soon as one shot was fired another was ready captain nemo said i this arm is perfect and easily handled i only ask to be allowed to try it but how shall we gain the bottom of the sea at this moment professor the _nautilus_ is stranded in five fathoms and we have nothing to do but to start but how shall we get off you shall see captain nemo thrust his head into the helmet conseil and i did the same not without hearing an ironical good sport from the canadian the upper part of our dress terminated in a copper collar upon which was screwed the metal helmet three holes protected by thick glass allowed us to see in all directions by simply turning our head in the interior of the headdress as soon as it was in position the rouquayrol apparatus on our backs began to act and for my part i could breathe with ease with the ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt and the gun in my hand i was ready to set out but to speak the truth imprisoned in these heavy garments and glued to the deck by my leaden soles it was impossible for me to take a step illustration i was ready to set out but this state of things was provided for i felt myself being pushed into a little room contiguous to the wardroberoom my companions followed towed along in the same way i heard a watertight door furnished with stopperplates close upon us and we were wrapped in profound darkness after some minutes a loud hissing was heard i felt the cold mount from my feet to my chest evidently from some part of the vessel they had by means of a tap given entrance to the water which was invading us and with which the room was soon filled a second door cut in the side of the _nautilus_ then opened we saw a faint light in another instant our feet trod the bottom of the sea and now how can i retrace the impression left upon me by that walk under the waters words are impotent to relate such wonders captain nemo walked in front his companion followed some steps behind conseil and i remained near each other as if an exchange of words had been possible through our metallic cases i no longer felt the weight of my clothing or of my shoes of my reservoir of air or my thick helmet in the midst of which my head rattled like an almond in its shell the light which lit the soil thirty feet below the surface of the ocean astonished me by its power the solar rays shone through the watery mass easily and dissipated all colour and i clearly distinguished objects at a distance of a hundred and fifty yards beyond that the tints darkened into fine gradations of ultramarine and faded into vague obscurity truly this water which surrounded me was but another air denser than the terrestrial atmosphere but almost as transparent above me was the calm surface of the sea we were walking on fine even sand not wrinkled as on a flat shore which retains the impression of the billows this dazzling carpet really a reflector repelled the rays of the sun with wonderful intensity which accounted for the vibration which penetrated every atom of liquid shall i be believed when i say that at the depth of thirty feet i could see as if i was in broad daylight for a quarter of an hour i trod on this sand sown with the impalpable dust of shells the hull of the _nautilus_ resembling a long shoal disappeared by degrees but its lantern when darkness should overtake us in the waters would help to guide us on board by its distinct rays soon forms of objects outlined in the distance were discernible i recognised magnificent rocks hung with a tapestry of zoophytes of the most beautiful kind and i was at first struck by the peculiar effect of this medium it was then ten in the morning the rays of the sun struck the surface of the waves at rather an oblique angle and at the touch of their light decomposed by refraction as through a prism flowers rocks plants shells and polypi were shaded at the edges by the seven solar colours it was marvellous a feast for the eyes this complication of coloured tints a perfect kaleidoscope of green yellow orange violet indigo and blue in one word the whole palette of an enthusiastic colourist why could i not communicate to conseil the lively sensations which were mounting to my brain and rival him in expressions of admiration for aught i knew captain nemo and his companion might be able to exchange thoughts by means of signs previously agreed upon so for want of better i talked to myself i declaimed in the copper box which covered my head thereby expending more air in vain words than was perhaps expedient various kinds of isis clusters of pure tuftcoral prickly fungi and anemones formed a brilliant garden of flowers enamelled with porphitæ decked with their collarettes of blue tentacles seastars studding the sandy bottom together with asterophytons like fine lace embroidered by the hands of naïads whose festoons were waved by the gentle undulations caused by our walk it was a real grief to me to crush under my feet the brilliant specimens of molluscs which strewed the ground by thousands of hammerheads donaciae veritable bounding shells of staircases and red helmetshells angelwings and many others produced by this inexhaustible ocean but we were bound to walk so we went on whilst above our heads waved shoals of physalides leaving their tentacles to float in their train medusæ whose umbrellas of opal or rosepink escalloped with a band of blue sheltered us from the rays of the sun and fiery pelagiæ which in the darkness would have strewn our path with phosphorescent light all these wonders i saw in the space of a quarter of a mile scarcely stopping and following captain nemo who beckoned me on by signs soon the nature of the soil changed to the sandy plain succeeded an extent of slimy mud which the americans call ooze composed of equal parts of silicious and calcareous shells we then travelled over a plain of seaweed of wild and luxuriant vegetation this sward was of close texture and soft to the feet and rivalled the softest carpet woven by the hand of man but whilst verdure was spread at our feet it did not abandon our heads a light network of marine plants of that inexhaustible family of seaweeds of which more than two thousand kinds are known grew on the surface of the water i saw long ribbons of fucus floating some globular others tuberous laurenciæ and cladostephi of most delicate foliage and some rhodomeniæ palmatæ resembling the fan of a cactus i noticed that the green plants kept nearer the top of the sea whilst the red were at a greater depth leaving to the black or brown hydrophytes the care of forming gardens and parterres in the remote beds of the ocean we had quitted the _nautilus_ about an hour and a half it was near noon i knew by the perpendicularity of the suns rays which were no longer refracted the magical colours disappeared by degrees and the shades of emerald and sapphire were effaced we walked with a regular step which rang upon the ground with astonishing intensity the slightest noise was transmitted with a quickness to which the ear is unaccustomed on the earth indeed water is a better conductor of sound than air in the ratio of four to one at this period the earth sloped downwards the light took a uniform tint we were at a depth of a hundred and five yards and twenty inches undergoing a pressure of six atmospheres at this depth i could still see the rays of the sun though feebly to their intense brilliancy had succeeded a reddish twilight the lowest state between day and night but we could still see well enough it was not necessary to resort to the ruhmkorff apparatus as yet at this moment captain nemo stopped he waited till i joined him and then pointed to an obscure mass looming in the shadow at a short distance it is the forest of the island of crespo thought iand i was not mistaken chapter xvi a submarine forest we had at last arrived on the borders of this forest doubtless one of the finest of captain nemos immense domains he looked upon it as his own and considered he had the same right over it that the first men had in the first days of the world and indeed who would have disputed with him the possession of this submarine property what other hardier pioneer would come hatchet in hand to cut down the dark copses this forest was composed of large treeplants and the moment we penetrated under its vast arcades i was struck by the singular position of their branchesa position i had not yet observed not a herb which carpeted the ground not a branch which clothed the trees was either broken or bent nor did they extend horizontally all stretched up to the surface of the ocean not a filament not a ribbon however thin they might be but kept as straight as a rod of iron the fuci and llianas grew in rigid perpendicular lines due to the density of the element which had produced them motionless yet when bent to one side by the hand they directly resumed their former position truly it was the region of perpendicularity i soon accustomed myself to this fantastic position as well as to the comparative darkness which surrounded us the soil of the forest seemed covered with sharp blocks difficult to avoid the submarine flora struck me as being very perfect and richer even than it would have been in the arctic or tropical zones where these productions are not so plentiful but for some minutes i involuntarily confounded the genera taking zoophytes for hydrophytes animals for plants and who would not have been mistaken the fauna and the flora are too closely allied in this submarine world these plants are selfpropagated and the principle of their existence is in the water which upholds and nourishes them the greater number instead of leaves shot forth blades of capricious shapes comprised within a scale of colourspink carmine green olive fawn and brown i saw there but not dried up as our specimens of the _nautilus_ are pavonari spread like a fan as if to catch the breeze scarlet ceramies whose laminaries extended their edible shoots of fernshaped nereocysti which grow to a height of fifteen feet clusters of acetabuli whose stems increase in size upwards and numbers of other marine plants all devoid of flowers curious anomaly fantastic element said an ingenious naturalist in which the animal kingdom blossoms and the vegetable does not under these numerous shrubs as large as trees of the temperate zone and under their damp shadow were massed together real bushes of living flowers hedges of zoophytes on which blossomed some zebrameandrines with crooked grooves some yellow caryophylliæ and to complete the allusion the fishflies flew from branch to branch like a swarm of hummingbirds whilst yellow lepisacomthi with bristling jaws dactylopteri and monocentrides rose at our feet like a flight of snipes in about an hour captain nemo gave the signal to halt i for my part was not sorry and we stretched ourselves under an arbour of alariæ the long thin blades of which stood up like arrows this short rest seemed delicious to me there was nothing wanting but the charm of conversation but impossible to speak impossible to answer i only put my great copper head to conseils i saw the worthy fellows eyes glistening with delight and to show his satisfaction he shook himself in his breastplate of air in the most comical way in the world after four hours of this walking i was surprised not to find myself dreadfully hungry how to account for this state of the stomach i could not tell but instead i felt an insurmountable desire to sleep which happens to all divers and my eyes soon closed behind the thick glasses and i fell into a heavy slumber which the movement alone had prevented before captain nemo and his robust companion stretched in the clear crystal set us the example how long i remained buried in this drowsiness i cannot judge but when i woke the sun seemed sinking towards the horizon captain nemo had already risen and i was beginning to stretch my limbs when an unexpected apparition brought me briskly to my feet a few steps off a monstrous seaspider about thirtyeight inches high was watching me with squinting eyes ready to spring upon me though my divers dress was thick enough to defend me from the bite of this animal i could not help shuddering with horror conseil and the sailor of the _nautilus_ awoke at this moment captain nemo pointed out the hideous crustacean which a blow from the butt end of the gun knocked over and i saw the horrible claws of the monster writhe in terrible convulsions this accident reminded me that other animals more to be feared might haunt these obscure depths against whose attacks my divingdress would not protect me i had never thought of it before but i now resolved to be upon my guard indeed i thought that this halt would mark the termination of our walk but i was mistaken for instead of returning to the _nautilus_ captain nemo continued his bold excursion the ground was still on the incline its declivity seemed to be getting greater and to be leading us to greater depths it must have been about three oclock when we reached a narrow valley between high perpendicular walls situated about seventyfive fathoms deep thanks to the perfection of our apparatus we were fortyfive fathoms below the limit which nature seems to have imposed on man as to his submarine excursions i say seventyfive fathoms though i had no instrument by which to judge the distance but i knew that even in the clearest waters the solar rays could not penetrate further and accordingly the darkness deepened at ten paces not an object was visible i was groping my way when i suddenly saw a brilliant white light captain nemo had just put his electric apparatus into use his companion did the same and conseil and i followed their example by turning a screw i established a communication between the wire and the spiral glass and the sea lit by our four lanterns was illuminated for a circle of thirtysix yards captain nemo was still plunging into the dark depths of the forest whose trees were getting scarcer at every step i noticed that vegetable life disappeared sooner than animal life the medusæ had already abandoned the arid soil from which a great number of animals zoophytes articulata molluscs and fishes still obtained sustenance as we walked i thought the light of our ruhmkorff apparatus could not fail to draw some inhabitant from its dark couch but if they did approach us they at least kept at a respectful distance from the hunters several times i saw captain nemo stop put his gun to his shoulder and after some moments drop it and walk on at last after about four hours this marvellous excursion came to an end a wall of superb rocks in an imposing mass rose before us a heap of gigantic blocks an enormous steep granite shore forming dark grottos but which presented no practicable slope it was the prop of the island of crespo it was the earth captain nemo stopped suddenly a gesture of his brought us all to a halt and however desirous i might be to scale the wall i was obliged to stop here ended captain nemos domains and he would not go beyond them further on was a portion of the globe he might not trample upon the return began captain nemo had returned to the head of his little band directing their course without hesitation i thought we were not following the same road to return to the _nautilus_ the new road was very steep and consequently very painful we approached the surface of the sea rapidly but this return to the upper strata was not so sudden as to cause relief from the pressure too rapidly which might have produced serious disorder in our organisation and brought on internal lesions so fatal to divers very soon light reappeared and grew and the sun being low on the horizon the refraction edged the different objects with a spectral ring at ten yards and a half deep we walked amidst a shoal of little fishes of all kinds more numerous than the birds of the air and also more agile but no aquatic game worthy of a shot had as yet met our gaze when at that moment i saw the captain shoulder his gun quickly and follow a moving object into the shrubs he firedi heard a slight hissing and a creature fell stunned at some distance from us it was a magnificent seaotter an enhydrus the only exclusively marine quadruped this otter was five feet long and must have been very valuable its skin chestnutbrown above and silvery underneath would have made one of those beautiful furs so sought after in the russian and chinese markets the fineness and the lustre of its coat would certainly fetch i admired this curious mammal with its rounded head ornamented with short ears its round eyes and white whiskers like those of a cat with webbed feet and nails and tufted tail this precious animal hunted and tracked by fishermen has now become very rare and taken refuge chiefly in the northern parts of the pacific or probably its race would soon become extinct captain nemos companion took the beast threw it over his shoulder and we continued our journey for one hour a plain of sand lay stretched before us sometimes it rose to within two yards and some inches of the surface of the water i then saw our image clearly reflected drawn inversely and above us appeared an identical group reflecting our movements and our actions in a word like us in every point except that they walked with their heads downward and their feet in the air another effect i noticed which was the passage of thick clouds which formed and vanished rapidly but on reflection i understood that these seeming clouds were due to the varying thickness of the reeds at the bottom and i could even see the fleecy foam which their broken tops multiplied on the water and the shadows of large birds passing above our heads whose rapid flight i could discern on the surface of the sea on this occasion i was witness to one of the finest gunshots which ever made the nerves of a hunter thrill a large bird of great breadth of wing clearly visible approached hovering over us captain nemos companion shouldered his gun and fired when it was only a few yards above the waves the creature fell stunned and the force of its fall brought it within the reach of the dexterous hunters grasp it was an albatross of the finest kind our march had not been interrupted by this incident for two hours we followed these sandy plains then fields of algæ very disagreeable to cross candidly i could do no more when i saw a glimmer of light which for a half mile broke the darkness of the waters it was the lantern of the _nautilus_ before twenty minutes were over we should be on board and i should be able to breathe with ease for it seemed that my reservoir supplied air very deficient in oxygen but i did not reckon on an accidental meeting which delayed our arrival for some time i had remained some steps behind when i presently saw captain nemo coming hurriedly towards me with his strong hand he bent me to the ground his companion doing the same to conseil at first i knew not what to think of this sudden attack but i was soon reassured by seeing the captain lie down beside me and remain immovable i was stretched on the ground just under the shelter of a bush of algæ when raising my head i saw some enormous mass casting phosphorescent gleams pass blusteringly by my blood froze in my veins as i recognised two formidable sharks which threatened us it was a couple of tintoreas terrible creatures with enormous tails and a dull glassy stare the phosphorescent matter ejected from holes pierced around the muzzle monstrous brutes which would crush a whole man in their iron jaws i did not know whether conseil stopped to classify them for my part i noticed their silver bellies and their huge mouths bristling with teeth from a very unscientific point of view and more as a possible victim than as a naturalist happily the voracious creatures do not see well they passed without seeing us brushing us with their brownish fins and we escaped by a miracle from a danger certainly greater than meeting a tiger fullface in the forest half an hour after guided by the electric light we reached the _nautilus_ the outside door had been left open and captain nemo closed it as soon as we had entered the first cell he then pressed a knob i heard the pumps working in the midst of the vessel i felt the water sinking from around me and in a few moments the cell was entirely empty the inside door then opened and we entered the vestry there our divingdress was taken off not without some trouble and fairly worn out from want of food and sleep i returned to my room in great wonder at this surprising excursion at the bottom of the sea chapter xvii four thousand leagues under the pacific the next morning the th of november i had quite recovered from my fatigues of the day before and i went up on to the platform just as the second lieutenant was uttering his daily phrase i was admiring the magnificent aspect of the ocean when captain nemo appeared he did not seem to be aware of my presence and began a series of astronomical observations then when he had finished he went and leant on the cage of the watchlight and gazed abstractedly on the ocean in the meantime a number of the sailors of the _nautilus_ all strong and healthy men had come up onto the platform they came to draw up the nets that had been laid all night these sailors were evidently of different nations although the european type was visible in all of them i recognised some unmistakable irishmen frenchmen some sclaves and a greek or a candiote they were civil and only used that odd language among themselves the origin of which i could not guess neither could i question them the nets were hauled in they were a large kind of chaluts like those on the normandy coasts great pockets that the waves and a chain fixed in the smaller meshes kept open these pockets drawn by iron poles swept through the water and gathered in everything in their way that day they brought up curious specimens from those productive coasts i reckoned that the haul had brought in more than nine hundredweight of fish it was a fine haul but not to be wondered at indeed the nets are let down for several hours and enclose in their meshes an infinite variety we had no lack of excellent food and the rapidity of the _nautilus_ and the attraction of the electric light could always renew our supply these several productions of the sea were immediately lowered through the panel to the stewards room some to be eaten fresh and others pickled the fishing ended the provision of air renewed i thought that the _nautilus_ was about to continue its submarine excursion and was preparing to return to my room when without further preamble the captain turned to me saying professor is not this ocean gifted with real life it has its tempers and its gentle moods yesterday it slept as we did and now it has woke after a quiet night look he continued it wakes under the caresses of the sun it is going to renew its diurnal existence it is an interesting study to watch the play of its organisation it has a pulse arteries spasms and i agree with the learned maury who discovered in it a circulation as real as the circulation of blood in animals yes the ocean has indeed circulation and to promote it the creator has caused things to multiply in itcaloric salt and animalculae when captain nemo spoke thus he seemed altogether changed and aroused an extraordinary emotion in me also he added true existence is there and i can imagine the foundations of nautical towns clusters of submarine houses which like the _nautilus_ would ascend every morning to breathe at the surface of the water free towns independent cities yet who knows whether some despot captain nemo finished his sentence with a violent gesture then addressing me as if to chase away some sorrowful thought m aronnax he asked do you know the depth of the ocean i only know captain what the principal soundings have taught us could you tell me them so that i can suit them to my purpose these are some i replied that i remember if i am not mistaken a depth of yards has been found in the north atlantic and yards in the mediterranean the most remarkable soundings have been made in the south atlantic near the thirtyfifth parallel and they gave yards yards and yards to sum up all it is reckoned that if the bottom of the sea were levelled its mean depth would be about one and threequarter leagues well professor replied the captain we shall show you better than that i hope as to the mean depth of this part of the pacific i tell you it is only yards having said this captain nemo went towards the panel and disappeared down the ladder i followed him and went into the large drawingroom the screw was immediately put in motion and the log gave twenty miles an hour during the days and weeks that passed captain nemo was very sparing of his visits i seldom saw him the lieutenant pricked the ships course regularly on the chart so i could always tell exactly the route of the _nautilus_ nearly every day for some time the panels of the drawingroom were opened and we were never tired of penetrating the mysteries of the submarine world the general direction of the _nautilus_ was southeast and it kept between and yards of depth one day however i do not know why being drawn diagonally by means of the inclined planes it touched the bed of the sea the thermometer indicated a temperature of cent a temperature that at this depth seemed common to all latitudes at three oclock in the morning of the th of november the _nautilus_ crossed the tropic of cancer at long on th instant it sighted the sandwich islands where cook died february we had then gone leagues from our startingpoint in the morning when i went on the platform i saw two miles to windward hawaii the largest of the seven islands that form the group i saw clearly the cultivated ranges and the several mountainchains that run parallel with the side and the volcanoes that overtop mounarea which rise yards above the level of the sea besides other things the nets brought up were several flabellariae and graceful polypi that are peculiar to that part of the ocean the direction of the _nautilus_ was still to the southeast it crossed the equator december in long and on the th of the same month after crossing rapidly and without anything in particular occurring we sighted the marquesas group i saw three miles off martins peak in noukahiva the largest of the group that belongs to france i only saw the woody mountains against the horizon because captain nemo did not wish to bring the ship to the wind there the nets brought up beautiful specimens of fish some with azure fins and tails like gold the flesh of which is unrivalled some nearly destitute of scales but of exquisite flavour others with bony jaws and yellowtinged gills as good as bonitos all fish that would be of use to us after leaving these charming islands protected by the french flag from the th to the th of december the _nautilus_ sailed over about miles during the daytime of the th of december i was busy reading in the large drawingroom ned land and conseil watched the luminous water through the halfopen panels the _nautilus_ was immovable while its reservoirs were filled it kept at a depth of yards a region rarely visited in the ocean and in which large fish were seldom seen i was then reading a charming book by jean mace the slaves of the stomach and i was learning some valuable lessons from it when conseil interrupted me will master come here a moment he said in a curious voice what is the matter conseil i want master to look i rose went and leaned on my elbows before the panes and watched in a full electric light an enormous black mass quite immovable was suspended in the midst of the waters i watched it attentively seeking to find out the nature of this gigantic cetacean but a sudden thought crossed my mind a vessel i said half aloud yes replied the canadian a disabled ship that has sunk perpendicularly ned land was right we were close to a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains the keel seemed to be in good order and it had been wrecked at most some few hours three stumps of masts broken off about two feet above the bridge showed that the vessel had had to sacrifice its masts but lying on its side it had filled and it was heeling over to port this skeleton of what it had once been was a sad spectacle as it lay lost under the waves but sadder still was the sight of the bridge where some corpses bound with ropes were still lying i counted fivefour men one of whom was standing at the helm and a woman standing by the poop holding an infant in her arms she was quite young i could distinguish her features which the water had not decomposed by the brilliant light from the _nautilus_ in one despairing effort she had raised her infant above her headpoor little thingwhose arms encircled its mothers neck the attitude of the four sailors was frightful distorted as they were by their convulsive movements whilst making a last effort to free themselves from the cords that bound them to the vessel the steersman alone calm with a grave clear face his grey hair glued to his forehead and his hand clutching the wheel of the helm seemed even then to be guiding the three broken masts through the depths of the ocean what a scene we were dumb our hearts beat fast before this shipwreck taken as it were from life and photographed in its last moments and i saw already coming towards it with hungry eyes enormous sharks attracted by the human flesh however the _nautilus_ turning went round the submerged vessel and in one instant i read on the sternthe florida sunderland chapter xviii vanikoro this terrible spectacle was the forerunner of the series of maritime catastrophes that the _nautilus_ was destined to meet with in its route as long as it went through more frequented waters we often saw the hulls of shipwrecked vessels that were rotting in the depths and deeper down cannons bullets anchors chains and a thousand other iron materials eaten up by rust however on the th of december we sighted the pomotou islands the old dangerous group of bougainville that extend over a space of leagues at ese to wnw from the island ducie to that of lazareff this group covers an area of square leagues and it is formed of sixty groups of islands among which the gambier group is remarkable over which france exercises sway these are coral islands slowly raised but continuous created by the daily work of polypi then this new island will be joined later on to the neighboring groups and a fifth continent will stretch from new zealand and new caledonia and from thence to the marquesas one day when i was suggesting this theory to captain nemo he replied coldly the earth does not want new continents but new men chance had conducted the _nautilus_ towards the island of clermonttonnere one of the most curious of the group that was discovered in by captain bell of the minerva i could study now the madreporal system to which are due the islands in this ocean madrepores which must not be mistaken for corals have a tissue lined with a calcareous crust and the modifications of its structure have induced m milne edwards my worthy master to class them into five sections the animalcule that the marine polypus secretes live by millions at the bottom of their cells their calcareous deposits become rocks reefs and large and small islands here they form a ring surrounding a little inland lake that communicates with the sea by means of gaps there they make barriers of reefs like those on the coasts of new caledonia and the various pomoton islands in other places like those at reunion and at maurice they raise fringed reefs high straight walls near which the depth of the ocean is considerable some cablelengths off the shores of the island of clermont i admired the gigantic work accomplished by these microscopical workers these walls are specially the work of those madrepores known as milleporas porites madrepores and astraeas these polypi are found particularly in the rough beds of the sea near the surface and consequently it is from the upper part that they begin their operations in which they bury themselves by degrees with the debris of the secretions that support them such is at least darwins theory who thus explains the formation of the _atolls_ a superior theory to my mind to that given of the foundation of the madreporical works summits of mountains or volcanoes that are submerged some feet below the level of the sea i could observe closely these curious walls for perpendicularly they were more than yards deep and our electric sheets lighted up this calcareous matter brilliantly replying to a question conseil asked me as to the time these colossal barriers took to be raised i astonished him much by telling him that learned men reckoned it about the eighth of an inch in a hundred years towards evening clermonttonnerre was lost in the distance and the route of the _nautilus_ was sensibly changed after having crossed the tropic of capricorn in longitude it sailed wnw making again for the tropical zone although the summer sun was very strong we did not suffer from heat for at fifteen or twenty fathoms below the surface the temperature did not rise above from ten to twelve degrees on th of december we left to the east the bewitching group of the societies and the graceful tahiti queen of the pacific i saw in the morning some miles to the windward the elevated summits of the island these waters furnished our table with excellent fish mackerel bonitos and some varieties of a seaserpent on the th of december the _nautilus_ sailed into the midst of the new hebrides discovered by quiros in and that bougainville explored in and to which cook gave its present name in this group is composed principally of nine large islands that form a band of leagues nnw to sse between and s lat and deg and long we passed tolerably near to the island of aurou that at noon looked like a mass of green woods surmounted by a peak of great height that day being christmas day ned land seemed to regret sorely the noncelebration of christmas the family fete of which protestants are so fond i had not seen captain nemo for a week when on the morning of the th he came into the large drawingroom always seeming as if he had seen you five minutes before i was busily tracing the route of the _nautilus_ on the planisphere the captain came up to me put his finger on one spot on the chart and said this single word vanikoro the effect was magical it was the name of the islands on which la perouse had been lost i rose suddenly the _nautilus_ has brought us to vanikoro i asked yes professor said the captain and i can visit the celebrated islands where the boussole and the astrolabe struck if you like professor when shall we be there we are there now followed by captain nemo i went up on to the platform and greedily scanned the horizon to the ne two volcanic islands emerged of unequal size surrounded by a coral reef that measured forty miles in circumference we were close to vanikoro really the one to which dumont durville gave the name of isle de la recherche and exactly facing the little harbour of vanou situated in s lat and e long the earth seemed covered with verdure from the shore to the summits in the interior that were crowned by mount kapogo feet high the _nautilus_ having passed the outer belt of rocks by a narrow strait found itself among breakers where the sea was from thirty to forty fathoms deep under the verdant shade of some mangroves i perceived some savages who appeared greatly surprised at our approach in the long black body moving between wind and water did they not see some formidable cetacean that they regarded with suspicion just then captain nemo asked me what i knew about the wreck of la perouse only what everyone knows captain i replied and could you tell me what everyone knows about it he inquired ironically easily i related to him all that the last works of dumont durville had made knownworks from which the following is a brief account la perouse and his second captain de langle were sent by louis xvi in on a voyage of circumnavigation they embarked in the corvettes boussole and the astrolabe neither of which were again heard of in the french government justly uneasy as to the fate of these two sloops manned two large merchantmen the recherche and the esperance which left brest the th of september under the command of bruni dentrecasteaux two months after they learned from bowen commander of the albemarle that the debris of shipwrecked vessels had been seen on the coasts of new georgia but dentrecasteaux ignoring this communicationrather uncertain besidesdirected his course towards the admiralty islands mentioned in a report of captain hunters as being the place where la perouse was wrecked they sought in vain the esperance and the recherche passed before vanikoro without stopping there and in fact this voyage was most disastrous as it cost dentrecasteaux his life and those of two of his lieutenants besides several of his crew captain dillon a shrewd old pacific sailor was the first to find unmistakable traces of the wrecks on the th of may his vessel the st patrick passed close to tikopia one of the new hebrides there a lascar came alongside in a canoe sold him the handle of a sword in silver that bore the print of characters engraved on the hilt the lascar pretended that six years before during a stay at vanikoro he had seen two europeans that belonged to some vessels that had run aground on the reefs some years ago dillon guessed that he meant la perouse whose disappearance had troubled the whole world he tried to get on to vanikoro where according to the lascar he would find numerous debris of the wreck but winds and tides prevented him dillon returned to calcutta there he interested the asiatic society and the indian company in his discovery a vessel to which was given the name of the recherche was put at his disposal and he set out rd january accompanied by a french agent the recherche after touching at several points in the pacific cast anchor before vanikoro th july in that same harbour of vanou where the _nautilus_ was at this time there it collected numerous relics of the wreckiron utensils anchors pulleystrops swivelguns an lbshot fragments of astronomical instruments a piece of crown work and a bronze clock bearing this inscriptionbazin ma fait the mark of the foundry of the arsenal at brest about there could be no further doubt dillon having made all inquiries stayed in the unlucky place till october then he quitted vanikoro and directed his course towards new zealand put into calcutta th april and returned to france where he was warmly welcomed by charles x but at the same time without knowing dillons movements dumont durville had already set out to find the scene of the wreck and they had learned from a whaler that some medals and a cross of st louis had been found in the hands of some savages of louisiade and new caledonia dumont durville commander of the astrolabe had then sailed and two months after dillon had left vanikoro he put into hobart town there he learned the results of dillons inquiries and found that a certain james hobbs second lieutenant of the union of calcutta after landing on an island situated s lat and e long had seen some iron bars and red stuffs used by the natives of these parts dumont durville much perplexed and not knowing how to credit the reports of lowclass journals decided to follow dillons track on the th of february the astrolabe appeared off tikopia and took as guide and interpreter a deserter found on the island made his way to vanikoro sighted it on the th inst lay among the reefs until the th and not until the th did he cast anchor within the barrier in the harbour of vanou on the rd several officers went round the island and brought back some unimportant trifles the natives adopting a system of denials and evasions refused to take them to the unlucky place this ambiguous conduct led them to believe that the natives had illtreated the castaways and indeed they seemed to fear that dumont durville had come to avenge la perouse and his unfortunate crew however on the th appeased by some presents and understanding that they had no reprisals to fear they led m jacquireot to the scene of the wreck there in three or four fathoms of water between the reefs of pacou and vanou lay anchors cannons pigs of lead and iron embedded in the limy concretions the large boat and the whaler belonging to the astrolabe were sent to this place and not without some difficulty their crews hauled up an anchor weighing lbs a brass gun some pigs of iron and two copper swivelguns dumont durville questioning the natives learned too that la perouse after losing both his vessels on the reefs of this island had constructed a smaller boat only to be lost a second time where no one knew but the french government fearing that dumont durville was not acquainted with dillons movements had sent the sloop bayonnaise commanded by legoarant de tromelin to vanikoro which had been stationed on the west coast of america the bayonnaise cast her anchor before vanikoro some months after the departure of the astrolabe but found no new document but stated that the savages had respected the monument to la perouse that is the substance of what i told captain nemo so he said no one knows now where the third vessel perished that was constructed by the castaways on the island of vanikoro no one knows captain nemo said nothing but signed to me to follow him into the large saloon the _nautilus_ sank several yards below the waves and the panels were opened i hastened to the aperture and under the crustations of coral covered with fungi syphonules alcyons madrepores through myriads of charming fishgirelles glyphisidri pompherides diacopes and holocentresi recognised certain debris that the drags had not been able to tear upiron stirrups anchors cannons bullets capstan fittings the stem of a ship all objects clearly proving the wreck of some vessel and now carpeted with living flowers while i was looking on this desolate scene captain nemo said in a sad voice commander la perouse set out th december with his vessels la boussole and the astrolabe he first cast anchor at botany bay visited the friendly isles new caledonia then directed his course towards santa cruz and put into namouka one of the hapai group then his vessels struck on the unknown reefs of vanikoro the boussole which went first ran aground on the southerly coast the astrolabe went to its help and ran aground too the first vessel was destroyed almost immediately the second stranded under the wind resisted some days the natives made the castaways welcome they installed themselves in the island and constructed a smaller boat with the debris of the two large ones some sailors stayed willingly at vanikoro the others weak and ill set out with la perouse they directed their course towards the solomon islands and there perished with everything on the westerly coast of the chief island of the group between capes deception and satisfaction how do you know that by this that i found on the spot where was the last wreck captain nemo showed me a tinplate box stamped with the french arms and corroded by the salt water he opened it and i saw a bundle of papers yellow but still readable they were the instructions of the naval minister to commander la perouse annotated in the margin in louis xvis handwriting ah it is a fine death for a sailor said captain nemo at last a coral tomb makes a quiet grave and i trust that i and my comrades will find no other chapter xix torres straits during the night of the th or th of december the _nautilus_ left the shores of vanikoro with great speed her course was southwesterly and in three days she had gone over the leagues that separated it from la perouses group and the southeast point of papua early on the st of january conseil joined me on the platform master will you permit me to wish you a happy new year what conseil exactly as if i was at paris in my study at the jardin des plantes well i accept your good wishes and thank you for them only i will ask you what you mean by a happy new year under our circumstances do you mean the year that will bring us to the end of our imprisonment or the year that sees us continue this strange voyage really i do not know how to answer master we are sure to see curious things and for the last two months we have not had time for dullness the last marvel is always the most astonishing and if we continue this progression i do not know how it will end it is my opinion that we shall never again see the like i think then with no offence to master that a happy year would be one in which we could see everything on nd january we had made miles or french leagues since our startingpoint in the japan seas before the ships head stretched the dangerous shores of the coral sea on the northeast coast of australia our boat lay along some miles from the redoubtable bank on which cooks vessel was lost th june the boat in which cook was struck on a rock and if it did not sink it was owing to a piece of coral that was broken by the shock and fixed itself in the broken keel i had wished to visit the reef leagues long against which the sea always rough broke with great violence with a noise like thunder but just then the inclined planes drew the _nautilus_ down to a great depth and i could see nothing of the high coral walls i had to content myself with the different specimens of fish brought up by the nets i remarked among others some germons a species of mackerel as large as a tunny with bluish sides and striped with transverse bands that disappear with the animals life these fish followed us in shoals and furnished us with very delicate food we took also a large number of giltheads about one and a half inches long tasting like dorys and flying pyrapeds like submarine swallows which in dark nights light alternately the air and water with their phosphorescent light among the molluscs and zoophytes i found in the meshes of the net several species of alcyonarians echini hammers spurs dials cerites and hyalleae the flora was represented by beautiful floating seaweeds laminariae and macrocystes impregnated with the mucilage that transudes through their pores and among which i gathered an admirable nemastoma geliniarois that was classed among the natural curiosities of the museum two days after crossing the coral sea th january we sighted the papuan coasts on this occasion captain nemo informed me that his intention was to get into the indian ocean by the strait of torres his communication ended there the torres straits are nearly thirtyfour leagues wide but they are obstructed by an innumerable quantity of islands islets breakers and rocks that make its navigation almost impracticable so that captain nemo took all needful precautions to cross them the _nautilus_ floating betwixt wind and water went at a moderate pace her screw like a cetaceans tail beat the waves slowly profiting by this i and my two companions went up on to the deserted platform before us was the steersmans cage and i expected that captain nemo was there directing the course of the _nautilus_ i had before me the excellent charts of the straits of torres and i consulted them attentively round the _nautilus_ the sea dashed furiously the course of the waves that went from southeast to northwest at the rate of two and a half miles broke on the coral that showed itself here and there this is a bad sea remarked ned land detestable indeed and one that does not suit a boat like the _nautilus_ the captain must be very sure of his route for i see there pieces of coral that would do for its keel if it only touched them slightly indeed the situation was dangerous but the _nautilus_ seemed to slide like magic off these rocks it did not follow the routes of the astrolabe and the zelee exactly for they proved fatal to dumont durville it bore more northwards coasted the islands of murray and came back to the southwest towards cumberland passage i thought it was going to pass it by when going back to northwest it went through a large quantity of islands and islets little known towards the island sound and canal mauvais i wondered if captain nemo foolishly imprudent would steer his vessel into that pass where dumont durvilles two corvettes touched when swerving again and cutting straight through to the west he steered for the island of gilboa it was then three in the afternoon the tide began to recede being quite full the _nautilus_ approached the island that i still saw with its remarkable border of screwpines he stood off it at about two miles distant suddenly a shock overthrew me the _nautilus_ just touched a rock and stayed immovable laying lightly to port side when i rose i perceived captain nemo and his lieutenant on the platform they were examining the situation of the vessel and exchanging words in their incomprehensible dialect she was situated thus two miles on the starboard side appeared gilboa stretching from north to west like an immense arm towards the south and east some coral showed itself left by the ebb we had run aground and in one of those seas where the tides are middlinga sorry matter for the floating of the _nautilus_ however the vessel had not suffered for her keel was solidly joined but if she could neither glide off nor move she ran the risk of being for ever fastened to these rocks and then captain nemos submarine vessel would be done for i was reflecting thus when the captain cool and calm always master of himself approached me an accident i asked no an incident but an incident that will oblige you perhaps to become an inhabitant of this land from which you flee captain nemo looked at me curiously and made a negative gesture as much as to say that nothing would force him to set foot on terra firma again then he said besides m aronnax the _nautilus_ is not lost it will carry you yet into the midst of the marvels of the ocean our voyage is only begun and i do not wish to be deprived so soon of the honour of your company however captain nemo i replied without noticing the ironical turn of his phrase the _nautilus_ ran aground in open sea now the tides are not strong in the pacific and if you cannot lighten the _nautilus_ i do not see how it will be reinflated the tides are not strong in the pacific you are right there professor but in torres straits one finds still a difference of a yard and a half between the level of high and low seas today is th january and in five days the moon will be full now i shall be very much astonished if that satellite does not raise these masses of water sufficiently and render me a service that i should be indebted to her for having said this captain nemo followed by his lieutenant redescended to the interior of the _nautilus_ as to the vessel it moved not and was immovable as if the coralline polypi had already walled it up with their indestructible cement well sir said ned land who came up to me after the departure of the captain well friend ned we will wait patiently for the tide on the th instant for it appears that the moon will have the goodness to put it off again really really and this captain is not going to cast anchor at all since the tide will suffice said conseil simply the canadian looked at conseil then shrugged his shoulders sir you may believe me when i tell you that this piece of iron will navigate neither on nor under the sea again it is only fit to be sold for its weight i think therefore that the time has come to part company with captain nemo friend ned i do not despair of this stout _nautilus_ as you do and in four days we shall know what to hold to on the pacific tides besides flight might be possible if we were in sight of the english or provencal coast but on the papuan shores it is another thing and it will be time enough to come to that extremity if the _nautilus_ does not recover itself again which i look upon as a grave event but do they know at least how to act circumspectly there is an island on that island there are trees under those trees terrestrial animals bearers of cutlets and roast beef to which i would willingly give a trial in this friend ned is right said conseil and i agree with him could not master obtain permission from his friend captain nemo to put us on land if only so as not to lose the habit of treading on the solid parts of our planet i can ask him but he will refuse will master risk it asked conseil and we shall know how to rely upon the captains amiability to my great surprise captain nemo gave me the permission i asked for and he gave it very agreeably without even exacting from me a promise to return to the vessel but flight across new guinea might be very perilous and i should not have counselled ned land to attempt it better to be a prisoner on board the _nautilus_ than to fall into the hands of the natives at eight oclock armed with guns and hatchets we got off the _nautilus_ the sea was pretty calm a slight breeze blew on land conseil and i rowing we sped along quickly and ned steered in the straight passage that the breakers left between them the boat was well handled and moved rapidly ned land could not restrain his joy he was like a prisoner that had escaped from prison and knew not that it was necessary to reenter it meat we are going to eat some meat and what meat he replied real game no bread indeed i do not say that fish is not good we must not abuse it but a piece of fresh venison grilled on live coals will agreeably vary our ordinary course glutton said conseil he makes my mouth water it remains to be seen i said if these forests are full of game and if the game is not such as will hunt the hunter himself well said m aronnax replied the canadian whose teeth seemed sharpened like the edge of a hatchet but i will eat tigerloin of tigerif there is no other quadruped on this island friend ned is uneasy about it said conseil whatever it may be continued ned land every animal with four paws without feathers or with two paws without feathers will be saluted by my first shot very well master lands imprudences are beginning never fear m aronnax replied the canadian i do not want twentyfive minutes to offer you a dish of my sort at halfpast eight the _nautilus_ boat ran softly aground on a heavy sand after having happily passed the coral reef that surrounds the island of gilboa chapter xx a few days on land i was much impressed on touching land ned land tried the soil with his feet as if to take possession of it however it was only two months before that we had become according to captain nemo passengers on board the _nautilus_ but in reality prisoners of its commander in a few minutes we were within musketshot of the coast the whole horizon was hidden behind a beautiful curtain of forests enormous trees the trunks of which attained a height of feet were tied to each other by garlands of bindweed real natural hammocks which a light breeze rocked they were mimosas figs hibisci and palm trees mingled together in profusion and under the shelter of their verdant vault grew orchids leguminous plants and ferns but without noticing all these beautiful specimens of papuan flora the canadian abandoned the agreeable for the useful he discovered a cocotree beat down some of the fruit broke them and we drunk the milk and ate the nut with a satisfaction that protested against the ordinary food on the _nautilus_ excellent said ned land exquisite replied conseil and i do not think said the canadian that he would object to our introducing a cargo of coconuts on board i do not think he would but he would not taste them so much the worse for him said conseil and so much the better for us replied ned land there will be more for us one word only master land i said to the harpooner who was beginning to ravage another coconut tree coconuts are good things but before filling the canoe with them it would be wise to reconnoitre and see if the island does not produce some substance not less useful fresh vegetables would be welcome on board the _nautilus_ master is right replied conseil and i propose to reserve three places in our vessel one for fruits the other for vegetables and the third for the venison of which i have not yet seen the smallest specimen conseil we must not despair said the canadian let us continue i returned and lie in wait although the island seems uninhabited it might still contain some individuals that would be less hard than we on the nature of game ho ho said ned land moving his jaws significantly well ned said conseil my word returned the canadian i begin to understand the charms of anthropophagy ned ned what are you saying you a maneater i should not feel safe with you especially as i share your cabin i might perhaps wake one day to find myself half devoured friend conseil i like you much but not enough to eat you unnecessarily i would not trust you replied conseil but enough we must absolutely bring down some game to satisfy this cannibal or else one of these fine mornings master will find only pieces of his servant to serve him while we were talking thus we were penetrating the sombre arches of the forest and for two hours we surveyed it in all directions chance rewarded our search for eatable vegetables and one of the most useful products of the tropical zones furnished us with precious food that we missed on board i would speak of the breadfruit tree very abundant in the island of gilboa and i remarked chiefly the variety destitute of seeds which bears in malaya the name of rima ned land knew these fruits well he had already eaten many during his numerous voyages and he knew how to prepare the eatable substance moreover the sight of them excited him and he could contain himself no longer master he said i shall die if i do not taste a little of this breadfruit pie taste it friend nedtaste it as you want we are here to make experimentsmake them it wont take long said the canadian and provided with a lentil he lighted a fire of dead wood that crackled joyously during this time conseil and i chose the best fruits of the breadfruit some had not then attained a sufficient degree of maturity and their thick skin covered a white but rather fibrous pulp others the greater number yellow and gelatinous waited only to be picked these fruits enclosed no kernel conseil brought a dozen to ned land who placed them on a coal fire after having cut them in thick slices and while doing this repeating you will see master how good this bread is more so when one has been deprived of it so long it is not even bread added he but a delicate pastry you have eaten none master no ned very well prepare yourself for a juicy thing if you do not come for more i am no longer the king of harpooners after some minutes the part of the fruits that was exposed to the fire was completely roasted the interior looked like a white pasty a sort of soft crumb the flavour of which was like that of an artichoke it must be confessed this bread was excellent and i ate of it with great relish what time is it now asked the canadian two oclock at least replied conseil how time flies on firm ground sighed ned land let us be off replied conseil we returned through the forest and completed our collection by a raid upon the cabbagepalms that we gathered from the tops of the trees little beans that i recognised as the abrou of the malays and yams of a superior quality we were loaded when we reached the boat but ned land did not find his provisions sufficient fate however favoured us just as we were pushing off he perceived several trees from twentyfive to thirty feet high a species of palmtree at last at five oclock in the evening loaded with our riches we quitted the shore and half an hour after we hailed the _nautilus_ no one appeared on our arrival the enormous ironplated cylinder seemed deserted the provisions embarked i descended to my chamber and after supper slept soundly the next day th january nothing new on board not a sound inside not a sign of life the boat rested along the edge in the same place in which we had left it we resolved to return to the island ned land hoped to be more fortunate than on the day before with regard to the hunt and wished to visit another part of the forest at dawn we set off the boat carried on by the waves that flowed to shore reached the island in a few minutes we landed and thinking that it was better to give in to the canadian we followed ned land whose long limbs threatened to distance us he wound up the coast towards the west then fording some torrents he gained the high plain that was bordered with admirable forests some kingfishers were rambling along the watercourses but they would not let themselves be approached their circumspection proved to me that these birds knew what to expect from bipeds of our species and i concluded that if the island was not inhabited at least human beings occasionally frequented it after crossing a rather large prairie we arrived at the skirts of a little wood that was enlivened by the songs and flight of a large number of birds there are only birds said conseil but they are eatable replied the harpooner i do not agree with you friend ned for i see only parrots there friend conseil said ned gravely the parrot is like pheasant to those who have nothing else and i added this bird suitably prepared is worth knife and fork indeed under the thick foliage of this wood a world of parrots were flying from branch to branch only needing a careful education to speak the human language for the moment they were chattering with parrots of all colours and grave cockatoos who seemed to meditate upon some philosophical problem whilst brilliant red lories passed like a piece of bunting carried away by the breeze papuans with the finest azure colours and in all a variety of winged things most charming to behold but few eatable however a bird peculiar to these lands and which has never passed the limits of the arrow and papuan islands was wanting in this collection but fortune reserved it for me before long after passing through a moderately thick copse we found a plain obstructed with bushes i saw then those magnificent birds the disposition of whose long feathers obliges them to fly against the wind their undulating flight graceful aerial curves and the shading of their colours attracted and charmed ones looks i had no trouble in recognising them birds of paradise i exclaimed the malays who carry on a great trade in these birds with the chinese have several means that we could not employ for taking them sometimes they put snares on the top of high trees that the birds of paradise prefer to frequent sometimes they catch them with a viscous birdlime that paralyses their movements they even go so far as to poison the fountains that the birds generally drink from but we were obliged to fire at them during flight which gave us few chances to bring them down and indeed we vainly exhausted one half our ammunition about eleven oclock in the morning the first range of mountains that form the centre of the island was traversed and we had killed nothing hunger drove us on the hunters had relied on the products of the chase and they were wrong happily conseil to his great surprise made a double shot and secured breakfast he brought down a white pigeon and a woodpigeon which cleverly plucked and suspended from a skewer was roasted before a red fire of dead wood while these interesting birds were cooking ned prepared the fruit of the breadtree then the woodpigeons were devoured to the bones and declared excellent the nutmeg with which they are in the habit of stuffing their crops flavours their flesh and renders it delicious eating now ned what do you miss now some fourfooted game m aronnax all these pigeons are only sidedishes and trifles and until i have killed an animal with cutlets i shall not be content nor i ned if i do not catch a bird of paradise let us continue hunting replied conseil let us go towards the sea we have arrived at the first declivities of the mountains and i think we had better regain the region of forests that was sensible advice and was followed out after walking for one hour we had attained a forest of sagotrees some inoffensive serpents glided away from us the birds of paradise fled at our approach and truly i despaired of getting near one when conseil who was walking in front suddenly bent down uttered a triumphal cry and came back to me bringing a magnificent specimen ah bravo conseil master is very good no my boy you have made an excellent stroke take one of these living birds and carry it in your hand if master will examine it he will see that i have not deserved great merit why conseil because this bird is as drunk as a quail drunk yes sir drunk with the nutmegs that it devoured under the nutmegtree under which i found it see friend ned see the monstrous effects of intemperance by jove exclaimed the canadian because i have drunk gin for two months you must needs reproach me however i examined the curious bird conseil was right the bird drunk with the juice was quite powerless it could not fly it could hardly walk this bird belonged to the most beautiful of the eight species that are found in papua and in the neighbouring islands it was the large emerald bird the most rare kind it measured three feet in length its head was comparatively small its eyes placed near the opening of the beak and also small but the shades of colour were beautiful having a yellow beak brown feet and claws nutcoloured wings with purple tips pale yellow at the back of the neck and head and emerald colour at the throat chestnut on the breast and belly two horned downy nets rose from below the tail that prolonged the long light feathers of admirable fineness and they completed the whole of this marvellous bird that the natives have poetically named the bird of the sun but if my wishes were satisfied by the possession of the bird of paradise the canadians were not yet happily about two oclock ned land brought down a magnificent hog from the brood of those the natives call barioutang the animal came in time for us to procure real quadruped meat and he was well received ned land was very proud of his shot the hog hit by the electric ball fell stone dead the canadian skinned and cleaned it properly after having taken half a dozen cutlets destined to furnish us with a grilled repast in the evening then the hunt was resumed which was still more marked by ned and conseils exploits indeed the two friends beating the bushes roused a herd of kangaroos that fled and bounded along on their elastic paws but these animals did not take to flight so rapidly but what the electric capsule could stop their course ah professor cried ned land who was carried away by the delights of the chase what excellent game and stewed too what a supply for the _nautilus_ two three five down and to think that we shall eat that flesh and that the idiots on board shall not have a crumb i think that in the excess of his joy the canadian if he had not talked so much would have killed them all but he contented himself with a single dozen of these interesting marsupians these animals were small they were a species of those kangaroo rabbitss that live habitually in the hollows of trees and whose speed is extreme but they are moderately fat and furnish at least estimable food we were very satisfied with the results of the hunt happy ned proposed to return to this enchanting island the next day for he wished to depopulate it of all the eatable quadrupeds but he had reckoned without his host at six oclock in the evening we had regained the shore our boat was moored to the usual place the _nautilus_ like a long rock emerged from the waves two miles from the beach ned land without waiting occupied himself about the important dinner business he understood all about cooking well the barioutang grilled on the coals soon scented the air with a delicious odour indeed the dinner was excellent two woodpigeons completed this extraordinary menu the sago pasty the artocarpus bread some mangoes half a dozen pineapples and the liquor fermented from some coconuts overjoyed us i even think that my worthy companions ideas had not all the plainness desirable suppose we do not return to the _nautilus_ this evening said conseil suppose we never return added ned land just then a stone fell at our feet and cut short the harpooners proposition chapter xxi captain nemos thunderbolt we looked at the edge of the forest without rising my hand stopping in the action of putting it to my mouth ned lands completing its office stones do not fall from the sky remarked conseil or they would merit the name aerolites a second stone carefully aimed that made a savoury pigeons leg fall from conseils hand gave still more weight to his observation we all three arose shouldered our guns and were ready to reply to any attack are they apes cried ned land very nearlythey are savages to the boat i said hurrying to the sea it was indeed necessary to beat a retreat for about twenty natives armed with bows and slings appeared on the skirts of a copse that masked the horizon to the right hardly a hundred steps from us our boat was moored about sixty feet from us the savages approached us not running but making hostile demonstrations stones and arrows fell thickly ned land had not wished to leave his provisions and in spite of his imminent danger his pig on one side and kangaroos on the other he went tolerably fast in two minutes we were on the shore to load the boat with provisions and arms to push it out to sea and ship the oars was the work of an instant we had not gone two cablelengths when a hundred savages howling and gesticulating entered the water up to their waists i watched to see if their apparition would attract some men from the _nautilus_ on to the platform but no the enormous machine lying off was absolutely deserted twenty minutes later we were on board the panels were open after making the boat fast we entered into the interior of the _nautilus_ i descended to the drawingroom from whence i heard some chords captain nemo was there bending over his organ and plunged in a musical ecstasy captain he did not hear me captain i said touching his hand he shuddered and turning round said ah it is you professor well have you had a good hunt have you botanised successfully yes captain but we have unfortunately brought a troop of bipeds whose vicinity troubles me what bipeds savages savages he echoed ironically so you are astonished professor at having set foot on a strange land and finding savages savages where are there not any besides are they worse than others these whom you call savages but captain how many have you counted a hundred at least m aronnax replied captain nemo placing his fingers on the organ stops when all the natives of papua are assembled on this shore the _nautilus_ will have nothing to fear from their attacks the captains fingers were then running over the keys of the instrument and i remarked that he touched only the black keys which gave his melodies an essentially scotch character soon he had forgotten my presence and had plunged into a reverie that i did not disturb i went up again on to the platform night had already fallen for in this low latitude the sun sets rapidly and without twilight i could only see the island indistinctly but the numerous fires lighted on the beach showed that the natives did not think of leaving it i was alone for several hours sometimes thinking of the nativesbut without any dread of them for the imperturbable confidence of the captain was catchingsometimes forgetting them to admire the splendours of the night in the tropics my remembrances went to france in the train of those zodiacal stars that would shine in some hours time the moon shone in the midst of the constellations of the zenith the night slipped away without any mischance the islanders frightened no doubt at the sight of a monster aground in the bay the panels were open and would have offered an easy access to the interior of the _nautilus_ at six oclock in the morning of the th january i went up on to the platform the dawn was breaking the island soon showed itself through the dissipating fogs first the shore then the summits the natives were there more numerous than on the day beforefive or six hundred perhapssome of them profiting by the low water had come on to the coral at less than two cablelengths from the _nautilus_ i distinguished them easily they were true papuans with athletic figures men of good race large high foreheads large but not broad and flat and white teeth their woolly hair with a reddish tinge showed off on their black shining bodies like those of the nubians from the lobes of their ears cut and distended hung chaplets of bones most of these savages were naked amongst them i remarked some women dressed from the hips to knees in quite a crinoline of herbs that sustained a vegetable waistband some chiefs had ornamented their necks with a crescent and collars of glass beads red and white nearly all were armed with bows arrows and shields and carried on their shoulders a sort of net containing those round stones which they cast from their slings with great skill one of these chiefs rather near to the _nautilus_ examined it attentively he was perhaps a mado of high rank for he was draped in a mat of bananaleaves notched round the edges and set off with brilliant colours i could easily have knocked down this native who was within a short length but i thought that it was better to wait for real hostile demonstrations between europeans and savages it is proper for the europeans to parry sharply not to attack during low water the natives roamed about near the _nautilus_ but were not troublesome i heard them frequently repeat the word assai and by their gestures i understood that they invited me to go on land an invitation that i declined so that on that day the boat did not push off to the great displeasure of master land who could not complete his provisions this adroit canadian employed his time in preparing the viands and meat that he had brought off the island as for the savages they returned to the shore about eleven oclock in the morning as soon as the coral tops began to disappear under the rising tide but i saw their numbers had increased considerably on the shore probably they came from the neighbouring islands or very likely from papua however i had not seen a single native canoe having nothing better to do i thought of dragging these beautiful limpid waters under which i saw a profusion of shells zoophytes and marine plants moreover it was the last day that the _nautilus_ would pass in these parts if it float in open sea the next day according to captain nemos promise i therefore called conseil who brought me a little light drag very like those for the oyster fishery now to work for two hours we fished unceasingly but without bringing up any rarities the drag was filled with midasears harps melames and particularly the most beautiful hammers i have ever seen we also brought up some seaslugs pearloysters and a dozen little turtles that were reserved for the pantry on board but just when i expected it least i put my hand on a wonder i might say a natural deformity very rarely met with conseil was just dragging and his net came up filled with divers ordinary shells when all at once he saw me plunge my arm quickly into the net to draw out a shell and heard me utter a cry what is the matter sir he asked in surprise has master been bitten no my boy but i would willingly have given a finger for my discovery what discovery this shell i said holding up the object of my triumph it is simply an olive porphyry genus olive order of the pectinibranchidæ class of gasteropods subclass mollusca yes conseil but instead of being rolled from right to left this olive turns from left to right is it possible yes my boy it is a left shell shells are all righthanded with rare exceptions and when by chance their spiral is left amateurs are ready to pay their weight in gold conseil and i were absorbed in the contemplation of our treasure and i was promising myself to enrich the museum with it when a stone unfortunately thrown by a native struck against and broke the precious object in conseils hand i uttered a cry of despair conseil took up his gun and aimed at a savage who was poising his sling at ten yards from him i would have stopped him but his blow took effect and broke the bracelet of amulets which encircled the arm of the savage illustration conseil seized his gun conseil cried i conseil well sir do you not see that the cannibal has commenced the attack a shell is not worth the life of a man said i ah the scoundrel cried conseil i would rather he had broken my shoulder conseil was in earnest but i was not of his opinion however the situation had changed some minutes before and we had not perceived a score of canoes surrounded the _nautilus_ these canoes scooped out of the trunk of a tree long narrow well adapted for speed were balanced by means of a long bamboo pole which floated on the water they were managed by skilful halfnaked paddlers and i watched their advance with some uneasiness it was evident that these papuans had already had dealings with the europeans and knew their ships but this long iron cylinder anchored in the bay without masts or chimneys what could they think of it nothing good for at first they kept at a respectful distance however seeing it motionless by degrees they took courage and sought to familiarise themselves with it now this familiarity was precisely what it was necessary to avoid our arms which were noiseless could only produce a moderate effect on the savages who have little respect for aught but blustering things the thunderbolt without the reverberations of thunder would frighten man but little though the danger lies in the lightning not in the noise at this moment the canoes approached the _nautilus_ and a shower of arrows alighted on her i went down to the saloon but found no one there i ventured to knock at the door that opened into the captains room come in was the answer i entered and found captain nemo deep in algebraical calculations of _x_ and other quantities i am disturbing you said i for courtesys sake that is true m aronnax replied the captain but i think you have serious reasons for wishing to see me very grave ones the natives are surrounding us in their canoes and in a few minutes we shall certainly be attacked by many hundreds of savages ah said captain nemo quietly they are come with their canoes yes sir well sir we must close the hatches exactly and i came to say to you nothing can be more simple said captain nemo and pressing an electric button he transmitted an order to the ships crew it is all done sir said he after some moments the pinnace is ready and the hatches are closed you do not fear i imagine that these gentlemen could stave in walls on which the balls of your frigate have had no effect no captain but a danger still exists what is that sir it is that tomorrow at about this hour we must open the hatches to renew the air of the _nautilus_ now if at this moment the papuans should occupy the platform i do not see how you could prevent them from entering then sir you suppose that they will board us i am certain of it well sir let them come i see no reason for hindering them after all these papuans are poor creatures and i am unwilling that my visit to the island should cost the life of a single one of these wretches upon that i was going away but captain nemo detained me and asked me to sit down by him he questioned me with interest about our excursions on shore and our hunting and seemed not to understand the craving for meat that possessed the canadian then the conversation turned on various subjects and without being more communicative captain nemo showed himself more amiable amongst other things we happened to speak of the situation of the _nautilus_ run aground in exactly the same spot in this strait where dumont durville was nearly lost apropos of this this durville was one of your great sailors said the captain to me one of your most intelligent navigators he is the captain cook of you frenchmen unfortunate man of science after having braved the icebergs of the south pole the coral reefs of oceania the cannibals of the pacific to perish miserably in a railway train if this energetic man could have reflected during the last moments of his life what must have been uppermost in his last thoughts do you suppose so speaking captain nemo seemed moved and his emotion gave me a better opinion of him then chart in hand we reviewed the travels of the french navigator his voyages of circumnavigation his double detention at the south pole which led to the discovery of adelaide and louis philippe and fixing the hydrographical bearings of the principal islands of oceania that which your durville has done on the surface of the seas said captain nemo that have i done under them and more easily more completely than he the astrolabe and the zelee incessantly tossed about by the hurricane could not be worth the _nautilus_ quiet repository of labour that she is truly motionless in the midst of the waters tomorrow added the captain rising tomorrow at twenty minutes to three pm the _nautilus_ shall float and leave the strait of torres uninjured having curtly pronounced these words captain nemo bowed slightly this was to dismiss me and i went back to my room there i found conseil who wished to know the result of my interview with the captain my boy said i when i feigned to believe that his _nautilus_ was threatened by the natives of papua the captain answered me very sarcastically i have but one thing to say to you have confidence in him and go to sleep in peace have you no need of my services sir no my friend what is ned land doing if you will excuse me sir answered conseil friend ned is busy making a kangaroopie which will be a marvel i remained alone and went to bed but slept indifferently i heard the noise of the savages who stamped on the platform uttering deafening cries the night passed thus without disturbing the ordinary repose of the crew the presence of these cannibals affected them no more than the soldiers of a masked battery care for the ants that crawl over its front at six in the morning i rose the hatches had not been opened the inner air was not renewed but the reservoirs filled ready for any emergency were now resorted to and discharged several cubic feet of oxygen into the exhausted atmosphere of the _nautilus_ i worked in my room till noon without having seen captain nemo even for an instant on board no preparations for departure were visible i waited still some time then went into the large saloon the clock marked halfpast two in ten minutes it would be hightide and if captain nemo had not made a rash promise the _nautilus_ would be immediately detached if not many months would pass ere she could leave her bed of coral however some warning vibrations began to be felt in the vessel i heard the keel grating against the rough calcareous bottom of the coral reef at fiveandtwenty minutes to three captain nemo appeared in the saloon we are going to start said he ah replied i i have given the order to open the hatches and the papuans the papuans answered captain nemo slightly shrugging his shoulders will they not come inside the _nautilus_ how only by leaping over the hatches you have opened m aronnax quietly answered captain nemo they will not enter the hatches of the _nautilus_ in that way even if they were open i looked at the captain you do not understand said he hardly well come and you will see i directed my steps towards the central staircase there ned land and conseil were slyly watching some of the ships crew who were opening the hatches while cries of rage and fearful vociferations resounded outside the port lids were pulled down outside twenty horrible faces appeared but the first native who placed his hand on the stairrail struck from behind by some invisible force i know not what fled uttering the most fearful cries and making the wildest contortions ten of his companions followed him they met with the same fate conseil was in ecstasy ned land carried away by his violent instincts rushed on to the staircase but the moment he seized the rail with both hands he in his turn was overthrown i am struck by a thunderbolt cried he with an oath this explained all it was no rail but a metallic cable charged with electricity from the deck communicating with the platform whoever touched it felt a powerful shockand this shock would have been mortal if captain nemo had discharged into the conductor the whole force of the current it might truly be said that between his assailants and himself he had stretched a network of electricity which none could pass with impunity meanwhile the exasperated papuans had beaten a retreat paralysed with terror as for us half laughing we consoled and rubbed the unfortunate ned land who swore like one possessed but at this moment the _nautilus_ raised by the last waves of the tide quitted her coral bed exactly at the fortieth minute fixed by the captain her screw swept the waters slowly and majestically her speed increased gradually and sailing on the surface of the ocean she quitted safe and sound the dangerous passes of the straits of torres chapter xxii ægri somnia the following day th january the _nautilus_ continued her course between two seas but with such remarkable speed that i could not estimate it at less than thirtyfive miles an hour the rapidity of her screw was such that i could neither follow nor count its revolutions when i reflected that this marvellous electric agent after having afforded motion heat and light to the _nautilus_ still protected her from outward attack and transformed her into an ark of safety which no profane hand might touch without being thunderstricken my admiration was unbounded and from the structure it extended to the engineer who had called it into existence our course was directed to the west and on the th of january we doubled cape wessel situation in long and north lat which forms the east point of the gulf of carpentaria the reefs were still numerous but more equalised and marked on the chart with extreme precision the _nautilus_ easily avoided the breakers of money to port and the victoria reefs to starboard placed at long and on the th parallel which we strictly followed on the th of january captain nemo arrived in the sea of timor and recognised the island of that name in long from this point the direction of the _nautilus_ inclined towards the southwest her head was set for the indian ocean where would the fancy of captain nemo carry us next would he return to the coast of asia or would he approach again the shores of europe improbable conjectures both to a man who fled from inhabited continents then would he descend to the south was he going to double the cape of good hope then cape horn and finally go as far as the antarctic pole would he come back at last to the pacific where his _nautilus_ could sail free and independently time would show after having skirted the sands of cartier of hibernia seringapatam and scott last efforts of the solid against the liquid element on the th of january we lost sight of land altogether the speed of the _nautilus_ was considerably abated and with irregular course she sometimes swam in the bosom of the waters sometimes floated on their surface during this period of the voyage captain nemo made some interesting experiments on the varied temperature of the sea in different beds under ordinary conditions these observations are made by means of rather complicated instruments and with somewhat doubtful results by means of thermometrical soundingleads the glasses often breaking under the pressure of the water or an apparatus grounded on the variations of the resistance of metals to the electric currents results so obtained could not be correctly calculated on the contrary captain nemo went himself to test the temperature in the depths of the sea and his thermometer placed in communication with the different sheets of water gave him the required degree immediately and accurately it was thus that either by overloading her reservoirs or by descending obliquely by means of her inclined planes the _nautilus_ successively attained the depth of three four five seven nine and ten thousand yards and the definite result of this experience was that the sea preserved an average temperature of four degrees and a half at a depth of five thousand fathoms under all latitudes on the th of january the _nautilus_ seemed becalmed only a few yards beneath the surface of the waves her electric apparatus remained inactive and her motionless screw left her to drift at the mercy of the currents i supposed that the crew was occupied with interior repairs rendered necessary by the violence of the mechanical movements of the machine my companions and i then witnessed a curious spectacle the hatches of the saloon were open and as the beacon light of the _nautilus_ was not in action a dim obscurity reigned in the midst of the waters i observed the state of the sea under these conditions and the largest fish appeared to me no more than scarcely defined shadows when the _nautilus_ found herself suddenly transported into full light i thought at first that the beacon had been lighted and was casting its electric radiance into the liquid mass i was mistaken and after a rapid survey perceived my error the _nautilus_ floated in the midst of a phosphorescent bed which in this obscurity became quite dazzling it was produced by myriads of luminous animalculae whose brilliancy was increased as they glided over the metallic hull of the vessel i was surprised by lightning in the midst of these luminous sheets as though they had been rivulets of lead melted in an ardent furnace or metallic masses brought to a white heat so that by force of contrast certain portions of light appeared to cast a shade in the midst of the general ignition from which all shade seemed banished no this was not the calm irradiation of our ordinary lightning there was unusual life and vigour this was truly living light in reality it was an infinite agglomeration of coloured infusoria of veritable globules of jelly provided with a threadlike tentacle and of which as many as twentyfive thousand have been counted in less than two cubic halfinches of water during several hours the _nautilus_ floated in these brilliant waves and our admiration increased as we watched the marine monsters disporting themselves like salamanders i saw there in the midst of this fire that burns not the swift and elegant porpoise the indefatigable clown of the ocean and some swordfish ten feet long those prophetic heralds of the hurricane whose formidable sword would now and then strike the glass of the saloon then appeared the smaller fish the balista the leaping mackerel wolfthorntails and a hundred others which striped the luminous atmosphere as they swam this dazzling spectacle was enchanting perhaps some atmospheric condition increased the intensity of this phenomenon perhaps some storm agitated the surface of the waves but at this depth of some yards the _nautilus_ was unmoved by its fury and reposed peacefully in still water so we progressed incessantly charmed by some new marvel the days passed rapidly away and i took no account of them ned according to habit tried to vary the diet on board like snails we were fixed to our shells and i declare it is easy to lead a snails life thus this life seemed easy and natural and we thought no longer of the life we led on land but something happened to recall us to the strangeness of our situation on the th of january the _nautilus_ was in long and s lat the weather was threatening the sea rough and rolling there was a strong east wind the barometer which had been going down for some days foreboded a coming storm i went up on to the platform just as the second lieutenant was taking the measure of the horary angles and waited according to habit till the daily phrase was said but on this day it was exchanged for another phrase not less incomprehensible almost directly i saw captain nemo appear with a glass looking towards the horizon for some minutes he was immovable without taking his eye off the point of observation then he lowered his glass and exchanged a few words with his lieutenant the latter seemed to be a victim to some emotion that he tried in vain to repress captain nemo having more command over himself was cool he seemed too to be making some objections to which the lieutenant replied by formal assurances at least i concluded so by the difference of their tones and gestures for myself i had looked carefully in the direction indicated without seeing anything the sky and water were lost in the clear line of the horizon however captain nemo walked from one end of the platform to the other without looking at me perhaps without seeing me his step was firm but less regular than usual he stopped sometimes crossed his arms and observed the sea what could he be looking for on that immense expanse the _nautilus_ was then some hundreds of miles from the nearest coast the lieutenant had taken up the glass and examined the horizon steadfastly going and coming stamping his foot and showing more nervous agitation than his superior officer besides this mystery must necessarily be solved and before long for upon an order from captain nemo the engine increasing its propelling power made the screw turn more rapidly just then the lieutenant drew the captains attention again the latter stopped walking and directed his glass towards the place indicated he looked long i felt very much puzzled and descended to the drawingroom and took out an excellent telescope that i generally used then leaning on the cage of the watchlight that jutted out from the front of the platform set myself to look over all the line of the sky and sea but my eye was no sooner applied to the glass than it was quickly snatched out of my hands i turned round captain nemo was before me but i did not know him his face was transfigured his eyes flashed sullenly his teeth were set his stiff body clenched fists and head shrunk between his shoulders betrayed the violent agitation that pervaded his whole frame he did not move my glass fallen from his hands had rolled at his feet had i unwittingly provoked this fit of anger did this incomprehensible person imagine that i had discovered some forbidden secret no i was not the object of this hatred for he was not looking at me his eye was steadily fixed upon the impenetrable point of the horizon at last captain nemo recovered himself his agitation subsided he addressed some words in a foreign language to his lieutenant then turned to me m aronnax he said in rather an imperious tone i require you to keep one of the conditions that bind you to me what is it captain you must be confined with your companions until i think fit to release you you are the master i replied looking steadily at him but may i ask you one question none sir there was no resisting this imperious command it would have been useless i went down to the cabin occupied by ned land and conseil and told them the captains determination you may judge how this communication was received by the canadian but there was not time for altercation four of the crew waited at the door and conducted us to that cell where we had passed our first night on board the _nautilus_ ned land would have remonstrated but the door was shut upon him will master tell me what this means asked conseil i told my companions what had passed they were as much astonished as i and equally at a loss how to account for it meanwhile i was absorbed in my own reflections and could think of nothing but the strange fear depicted in the captains countenance i was utterly at a loss to account for it when my cogitations were disturbed by these words from ned land hallo breakfast is ready and indeed the table was laid evidently captain nemo had given this order at the same time that he had hastened the speed of the _nautilus_ will master permit me to make a recommendation asked conseil yes my boy well it is that master breakfasts it is prudent for we do not know what may happen you are right conseil unfortunately said ned land they have only given us the ships fare friend ned asked conseil what would you have said if the breakfast had been entirely forgotten this argument cut short the harpooners recriminations we sat down to table the meal was eaten in silence just then the luminous globe that lighted the cell went out and left us in total darkness ned land was soon asleep and what astonished me was that conseil went off into a heavy slumber i was thinking what could have caused his irresistible drowsiness when i felt my brain becoming stupefied in spite of my efforts to keep my eyes open they would close a painful suspicion seized me evidently soporific substances had been mixed with the food we had just taken imprisonment was not enough to conceal captain nemos projects from us sleep was more necessary i then heard the panels shut the undulations of the sea which caused a slight rolling motion ceased had the _nautilus_ quitted the surface of the ocean had it gone back to the motionless bed of water i tried to resist sleep it was impossible my breathing grew weak i felt a mortal cold freeze my stiffened and halfparalysed limbs my eyelids like leaden caps fell over my eyes i could not raise them a morbid sleep full of hallucinations bereft me of my being then the visions disappeared and left me in complete insensibility chapter xxiii the coral kingdom the next day i woke with my head singularly clear to my great surprise i was in my own room my companions no doubt had been reinstated in their cabin without having perceived it any more than i of what had passed during the night they were as ignorant as i was and to penetrate this mystery i only reckoned upon the chances of the future i then thought of quitting my room was i free again or a prisoner quite free i opened the door went to the halfdeck went up the central stairs the panels shut the evening before were open i went on to the platform ned land and conseil waited there for me i questioned them they knew nothing lost in a heavy sleep in which they had been totally unconscious they had been astonished at finding themselves in their cabin as for the _nautilus_ it seemed quiet and mysterious as ever it floated on the surface of the waves at a moderate pace nothing seemed changed on board the second lieutenant then came on to the platform and gave the usual order below as for captain nemo he did not appear of the people on board i only saw the impassive steward who served me with his usual dumb regularity about two oclock i was in the drawingroom busied in arranging my notes when the captain opened the door and appeared i bowed he made a slight inclination in return without speaking i resumed my work hoping that he would perhaps give me some explanation of the events of the preceding night he made none i looked at him he seemed fatigued his heavy eyes had not been refreshed by sleep his face looked very sorrowful he walked to and fro sat down and got up again took a chance book put it down consulted his instruments without taking his habitual notes and seemed restless and uneasy at last he came up to me and said are you a doctor m aronnax i so little expected such a question that i stared some time at him without answering are you a doctor he repeated several of your colleagues have studied medicine well said i i am a doctor and resident surgeon to the hospital i practised several years before entering the museum very well sir my answer had evidently satisfied the captain but not knowing what he would say next i waited for other questions reserving my answers according to circumstances m aronnax will you consent to prescribe for one of my men he asked is he ill yes i am ready to follow you come then i own my heart beat i do not know why i saw certain connection between the illness of one of the crew and the events of the day before and this mystery interested me at least as much as the sick man captain nemo conducted me to the poop of the _nautilus_ and took me into a cabin situated near the sailors quarters there on a bed lay a man about forty years of age with a resolute expression of countenance a true type of an anglosaxon i leant over him he was not only ill he was wounded his head swathed in bandages covered with blood lay on a pillow i undid the bandages and the wounded man looked at me with his large eyes and gave no sign of pain as i did it it was a horrible wound the skull shattered by some deadly weapon left the brain exposed which was much injured clots of blood had formed in the bruised and broken mass in colour like the dregs of wine there was both contusion and suffusion of the brain his breathing was slow and some spasmodic movements of the muscles agitated his face i felt his pulse it was intermittent the extremities of the body were growing cold already and i saw death must inevitably ensue after dressing the unfortunate mans wounds i readjusted the bandages on his head and turned to captain nemo what caused this wound i asked what does it signify he replied evasively a shock has broken one of the levers of the engine which struck myself but your opinion as to his state i hesitated before giving it you may speak said the captain this man does not understand french i gave a last look at the wounded man he will be dead in two hours can nothing save him nothing captain nemos hand contracted and some tears glistened in his eyes which i thought incapable of shedding any for some moments i still watched the dying man whose life ebbed slowly his pallor increased under the electric light that was shed over his deathbed i looked at his intelligent forehead furrowed with premature wrinkles produced probably by misfortune and sorrow i tried to learn the secret of his life from the last words that escaped his lips you can go now m aronnax said the captain i left him in the dying mans cabin and returned to my room much affected by this scene during the whole day i was haunted by uncomfortable suspicions and at night i slept badly and between my broken dreams i fancied i heard distant sighs like the notes of a funeral psalm were they the prayers of the dead murmured in that language that i could not understand the next morning i went on to the bridge captain nemo was there before me as soon as he perceived me he came to me professor will it be convenient to you to make a submarine excursion today with my companions i asked if they like we obey your orders captain will you be so good then as to put on your cork jackets it was not a question of dead or dying i rejoined ned land and conseil and told them of captain nemos proposition conseil hastened to accept it and this time the canadian seemed quite willing to follow our example it was eight oclock in the morning at halfpast eight we were equipped for this new excursion and provided with two contrivances for light and breathing the double door was open and accompanied by captain nemo who was followed by a dozen of the crew we set foot at a depth of about thirty feet on the solid bottom on which the _nautilus_ rested a slight declivity ended in an uneven bottom at fifteen fathoms depth this bottom differed entirely from the one i had visited on my first excursion under the waters of the pacific ocean here there was no fine sand no submarine prairies no seaforest i immediately recognised that marvellous region in which on that day the captain did the honours to us it was the coral kingdom the light produced a thousand charming varieties playing in the midst of the branches that were so vividly coloured i seemed to see the membraneous and cylindrical tubes tremble beneath the undulation of the waters i was tempted to gather their fresh petals ornamented with delicate tentacles some just blown the others budding while a small fish swimming swiftly touched them slightly like flights of birds but if my hand approached these living flowers these animated sensitive plants the whole colony took alarm the white petals reentered their red cases the flowers faded as i looked and the bush changed into a block of stony knobs chance had thrown me just by the most precious specimens of the zoophyte this coral was more valuable than that found in the mediterranean on the coasts of france italy and barbary its tints justified the poetical names of flower of blood and froth of blood that trade has given to its most beautiful productions coral is sold for per ounce and in this place the watery beds would make the fortunes of a company of coraldivers this precious matter often confused with other polypi formed then the inextricable plots called macciota and on which i noticed several beautiful specimens of pink coral but soon the bushes contract and the arborisations increase real petrified thickets long joists of fantastic architecture were disclosed before us captain nemo placed himself under a dark gallery where by a slight declivity we reached a depth of a hundred yards the light from our lamps produced sometimes magical effects following the rough outlines of the natural arches and pendants disposed like lustres that were tipped with points of fire at last after walking two hours we had attained a depth of about three hundred yards that is to say the extreme limit on which coral begins to form but there was no isolated bush nor modest brushwood at the bottom of lofty trees it was an immense forest of large mineral vegetations enormous petrified trees united by garlands of elegant seabindweed all adorned with clouds and reflections we passed freely under their high branches lost in the shade of the waves captain nemo had stopped i and my companions halted and turning round i saw his men were forming a semicircle round their chief watching attentively i observed that four of them carried on their shoulders an object of an oblong shape we occupied in this place the centre of a vast glade surrounded by the lofty foliage of the submarine forest our lamps threw over this place a sort of clear twilight that singularly elongated the shadows on the ground at the end of the glade the darkness increased and was only relieved by little sparks reflected by the points of coral ned land and conseil were near me we watched and i thought i was going to witness a strange scene on observing the ground i saw that it was raised in certain places by slight excrescences encrusted with limy deposits and disposed with a regularity that betrayed the hand of man in the midst of the glade on a pedestal of rocks roughly piled up stood a cross of coral that extended its long arms that one might have thought were made of petrified blood upon a sign from captain nemo one of the men advanced and at some feet from the cross he began to dig a hole with a pickaxe that he took from his belt i understood all this glade was a cemetery this hole a tomb this oblong object the body of the man who had died in the night the captain and his men had come to bury their companion in this general restingplace at the bottom of this inaccessible ocean the grave was being dug slowly the fish fled on all sides while their retreat was being thus disturbed i heard the strokes of the pickaxe which sparkled when it hit upon some flint lost at the bottom of the waters the hole was soon large and deep enough to receive the body then the bearers approached the body enveloped in a tissue of white linen was lowered into the damp grave captain nemo with his arms crossed on his breast and all the friends of him who had loved them knelt in prayer illustration all fell on their knees in an attitude of prayer the grave was then filled in with the rubbish taken from the ground which formed a slight mound when this was done captain nemo and his men rose then approaching the grave they knelt again and all extended their hands in sign of a last adieu then the funeral procession returned to the _nautilus_ passing under the arches of the forest in the midst of thickets along the coral bushes and still on the ascent at last the light of the ship appeared and its luminous track guided us to the _nautilus_ at one oclock we had returned as soon as i had changed my clothes i went up on to the platform and a prey to conflicting emotions i sat down near the binnacle captain nemo joined me i rose and said to him so as i said he would this man died in the night yes m aronnax and he rests now near his companions in the coral cemetery yes forgotten by all else but not by us we dug the grave and the polypi undertake to seal our dead for eternity and burying his face quickly in his hands he tried in vain to suppress a sob then he added our peaceful cemetery is there some hundred feet below the surface of the waves your dead sleep quietly at least captain out of the reach of sharks yes sir of sharks and men gravely replied the captain part two chapter i the indian ocean we now come to the second part of our journey under the sea the first ended with the moving scene in the coral cemetery which left such a deep impression on my mind thus in the midst of this great sea captain nemos life was passing even to his grave which he had prepared in one of its deepest abysses there not one of the oceans monsters could trouble the last sleep of the crew of the _nautilus_ of those friends riveted to each other in death as in life nor any man either had added the captain still the same fierce implacable defiance towards human society i could no longer content myself with the theory which satisfied conseil that worthy fellow persisted in seeing in the commander of the _nautilus_ one of those unknown _savants_ who return mankind contempt for indifference for him he was a misunderstood genius who tired of earths deceptions had taken refuge in this inaccessible medium where he might follow his instincts freely to my mind this explains but one side of captain nemos character indeed the mystery of that last night during which we had been chained in prison the sleep and the precaution so violently taken by the captain of snatching from my eyes the glass i had raised to sweep the horizon the mortal wound of the man due to an unaccountable shock of the _nautilus_ all put me on a new track no captain nemo was not satisfied with shunning man his formidable apparatus not only suited his instinct of freedom but perhaps also the design of some terrible retaliation at this moment nothing is clear to me i catch but a glimpse of light amidst all the darkness and i must confine myself to writing as events shall dictate that day the th of january at noon the second officer came to take the altitude of the sun i mounted the platform lit a cigar and watched the operation it seemed to me that the man did not understand french for several times i made remarks in a loud voice which must have drawn from him some involuntary sign of attention if he had understood them but he remained undisturbed and dumb as he was taking observations with the sextant one of the sailors of the _nautilus_ the strong man who had accompanied us on our first submarine excursion to the island of crespo came to clean the glasses of the lantern i examined the fittings of the apparatus the strength of which was increased a hundredfold by lenticular rings placed similar to those in a lighthouse and which projected their brilliance in a horizontal plane the electric lamp was combined in such a way as to give its most powerful light indeed it was produced in vacuo which insured both its steadiness and its intensity this vacuum economised the graphite points between which the luminous arc was developedan important point of economy for captain nemo who could not easily have replaced them and under these conditions their waste was imperceptible when the _nautilus_ was ready to continue its submarine journey i went down to the saloon the panel was closed and the course marked direct west we were furrowing the waters of the indian ocean a vast liquid plain with a surface of of acres and whose waters are so clear and transparent that any one leaning over them would turn giddy the _nautilus_ usually floated between fifty and a hundred fathoms deep we went on so for some days to any one but myself who had a great love for the sea the hours would have seemed long and monotonous but the daily walks on the platform when i steeped myself in the reviving air of the ocean the sight of the rich waters through the windows of the saloon the books in the library the compiling of my memoirs took up all my time and left me not a moment of ennui or weariness for some days we saw a great number of aquatic birds seamews or gulls some were cleverly killed and prepared in a certain way made very acceptable watergame amongst largewinged birds carried a long distance from all lands and resting upon the waves from the fatigue of their flight i saw some magnificent albatrosses uttering discordant cries like the braying of an ass and birds belonging to the family of the longwings as to the fish they always provoked our admiration when we surprised the secrets of their aquatic life through the open panels i saw many kinds which i never before had a chance of observing i shall notice chiefly ostracions peculiar to the red sea the indian ocean and that part which washes the coast of tropical america these fishes like the tortoise the armadillo the seahedgehog and the crustacea are protected by a breastplate which is neither chalky nor stony but real bone in some it takes the form of a solid triangle in others of a solid quadrangle amongst the triangular i saw some an inch and a half in length with wholesome flesh and a delicious flavour they are brown at the tail and yellow at the fins and i recommend their introduction into fresh water to which a certain number of seafish easily accustom themselves i would also mention quadrangular ostracions having on the back four large tubercles some dotted over with white spots on the lower part of the body and which may be tamed like birds trigons provided with spikes formed by the lengthening of their bony shell and which from their strange gruntings are called seapigs also dromedaries with large humps in the shape of a cone whose flesh is very tough and leathery i now borrow from the daily notes of master conseil certain fish of the genus petrodon peculiar to those seas with red backs and white chests which are distinguished by three rows of longitudinal filaments and some electrical seven inches long decked in the liveliest colours then as specimens of other kinds some ovoides resembling an egg of a dark brown colour marked with white bands and without tails diodons real seaporcupines furnished with spikes and capable of swelling in such a way as to look like cushions bristling with darts hippocampi common to every ocean some pegasi with lengthened snouts which their pectoral fins being much elongated and formed in the shape of wings allow if not to fly at least to shoot into the air pigeon spatulae with tails covered with many rings of shell macrognathi with long jaws an excellent fish nine inches long and bright with most agreeable colours palecoloured calliomores with rugged heads and plenty of chaetodons with long and tubular muzzles which kill insects by shooting them as from an airgun with a single drop of water these we may call the flycatchers of the seas in the eightyninth genus of fishes classed by lacepede belonging to the second lower class of bony characterised by opercules and bronchial membranes i remarked the scorpaena the head of which is furnished with spikes and which has but one dorsal fin these creatures are covered or not with little shells according to the subclass to which they belong the second subclass gives us specimens of didactyles fourteen or fifteen inches in length with yellow rays and heads of a most fantastic appearance as to the first subclass it gives several specimens of that singular looking fish appropriately called a seafrog with large head sometimes pierced with holes sometimes swollen with protuberances bristling with spikes and covered with tubercles it has irregular and hideous horns its body and tail are covered with callosities its sting makes a dangerous wound it is both repugnant and horrible to look at from the st to the rd of january the _nautilus_ went at the rate of two hundred and fifty leagues in twentyfour hours being five hundred and forty miles or twentytwo miles an hour if we recognised so many different varieties of fish it was because attracted by the electric light they tried to follow us the greater part however were soon distanced by our speed though some kept their place in the waters of the _nautilus_ for a time the morning of the th in s lat and long we observed keeling island a coral formation planted with magnificent cocos and which had been visited by mr darwin and captain fitzroy the _nautilus_ skirted the shores of this desert island for a little distance its nets brought up numerous specimens of polypi and curious shells of mollusca some precious productions of the species of delphinulae enriched the treasures of captain nemo to which i added an astraea punctifera a kind of parasite polypus often found fixed to a shell soon keeling island disappeared from the horizon and our course was directed to the northwest in the direction of the indian peninsula from keeling island our course was slower and more variable often taking us into great depths several times they made use of the inclined planes which certain internal levers placed obliquely to the waterline in that way we went about two miles but without ever obtaining the greatest depths of the indian sea which soundings of seven thousand fathoms have never reached as to the temperature of the lower strata the thermometer invariably indicated above zero i only observed that in the upper regions the water was always colder in the high levels than at the surface of the sea on the th of january the ocean was entirely deserted the _nautilus_ passed the day on the surface beating the waves with its powerful screw and making them rebound to a great height who under such circumstances would not have taken it for a gigantic cetacean three parts of this day i spent on the platform i watched the sea nothing on the horizon till about four oclock a steamer running west on our counter her masts were visible for an instant but she could not see the _nautilus_ being too low in the water i fancied this steamboat belonged to the p o company which runs from ceylon to sydney touching at king georges point and melbourne at five oclock in the evening before that fleeting twilight which binds night to day in tropical zones conseil and i were astonished by a curious spectacle it was a shoal of argonauts travelling along on the surface of the ocean we could count several hundreds they belonged to the tubercle kind which are peculiar to the indian seas these graceful molluscs moved backwards by means of their locomotive tube through which they propelled the water already drawn in of their eight tentacles six were elongated and stretched out floating on the water whilst the other two rolled up flat were spread to the wing like a light sail i saw their spiralshaped and fluted shells which cuvier justly compares to an elegant skiff a boat indeed it bears the creature which secretes it without its adhering to it for nearly an hour the _nautilus_ floated in the midst of this shoal of molluscs then i know not what sudden fright they took but as if at a signal every sail was furled the arms folded the body drawn in the shells turned over changing their centre of gravity and the whole fleet disappeared under the waves never did the ships of a squadron manœuvre with more unity at that moment night fell suddenly and the reeds scarcely raised by the breeze lay peaceably under the sides of the _nautilus_ the next day th of january we cut the equator at the eightysecond meridian and entered the northern hemisphere during the day a formidable troop of sharks accompanied us terrible creatures which multiply in these seas and make them very dangerous they were cestracio philippi sharks with brown backs and whitish bellies armed with eleven rows of teetheyed sharkstheir throat being marked with a large black spot surrounded with white like an eye there were also some isabella sharks with rounded snouts marked with dark spots these powerful creatures often hurled themselves at the windows of the saloon with such violence as to make us feel very insecure at such times ned land was no longer master of himself he wanted to go to the surface and harpoon the monsters particularly certain smoothhound sharks whose mouth is studded with teeth like a mosaic and large tigersharks nearly six yards long the last named of which seemed to excite him more particularly but the _nautilus_ accelerating her speed easily left the most rapid of them behind the th of january at the entrance of the vast bay of bengal we met repeatedly a forbidding spectacle dead bodies floating on the surface of the water they were the dead of the indian villages carried by the ganges to the level of the sea and which the vultures the only undertakers of the country had not been able to devour but the sharks did not fail to help them at their funeral work about seven oclock in the evening the _nautilus_ halfimmersed was sailing in a sea of milk at first sight the ocean seemed lactified was it the effect of the lunar rays no for the moon scarcely two days old was still lying hidden under the horizon in the rays of the sun the whole sky though lit by the sidereal rays seemed black by contrast with the whiteness of the waters conseil could not believe his eyes and questioned me as to the cause of this strange phenomenon happily i was able to answer him it is called a milk sea i explained a large extent of white wavelets often to be seen on the coasts of amboyna and in these parts of the sea but sir said conseil can you tell me what causes such an effect for i suppose the water is not really turned into milk no my boy and the whiteness which surprises you is caused only by the presence of myriads of infusoria a sort of luminous little worm gelatinous and without colour of the thickness of a hair and whose length is not more than seventhousandths of an inch these insects adhere to one another sometimes for several leagues several leagues exclaimed conseil yes my boy and you need not try to compute the number of these infusoria you will not be able for if i am not mistaken ships have floated on these milk seas for more than forty miles towards midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual colour but behind us even to the limits of the horizon the sky reflected the whitened waves and for a long time seemed impregnated with the vague glimmerings of an aurora borealis chapter ii a novel proposal of captain nemos on the th of february when at noon the _nautilus_ came to the surface of the sea in n lat there was land in sight about eight miles to westward the first thing i noticed was a range of mountains about two thousand feet high the shapes of which were most capricious on taking the bearings i knew that we were nearing the island of ceylon the pearl which hangs from the lobe of the indian peninsula captain nemo and his second appeared at this moment the captain glanced at the map then turning to me said the island of ceylon noted for its pearlfisheries would you like to visit one of them m aronnax certainly captain well the thing is easy though if we see the fisheries we shall not see the fishermen the annual exportation has not yet begun never mind i will give orders to make for the gulf of manaar where we shall arrive in the night the captain said something to his second who immediately went out soon the _nautilus_ returned to her native element and the manometer showed that she was about thirty feet deep well sir said captain nemo you and your companions shall visit the bank of manaar and if by chance some fisherman should be there we shall see him at work agreed captain by the bye m aronnax you are not afraid of sharks sharks exclaimed i this question seemed a very hard one well continued captain nemo i admit captain that i am not yet very familiar with that kind of fish we are accustomed to them replied captain nemo and in time you will be too however we shall be armed and on the road we may be able to hunt some of the tribe it is interesting so till tomorrow sir and early this said in a careless tone captain nemo left the saloon now if you were invited to hunt the bear in the mountains of switzerland what would you say very well tomorrow we will go and hunt the bear if you were asked to hunt the lion in the plains of atlas or the tiger in the indian jungles what would you say ha ha it seems we are going to hunt the tiger or the lion but when you are invited to hunt the shark in its natural element you would perhaps reflect before accepting the invitation as for myself i passed my hand over my forehead on which stood large drops of cold perspiration let us reflect said i and take our time hunting otters in submarine forests as we did in the island of crespo will pass but going up and down at the bottom of the sea where one is almost certain to meet sharks is quite another thing i know well that in certain countries particularly in the andaman islands the negroes never hesitate to attack them with a dagger in one hand and a running noose in the other but i also know that few who affront those creatures ever return alive however i am not a negro and if i were i think a little hesitation in this case would not be illtimed at this moment conseil and the canadian entered quite composed and even joyous they knew not what awaited them faith sir said ned land your captain nemothe devil take himhas just made us a very pleasant offer ah said i you know if agreeable to you sir interrupted conseil the commander of the _nautilus_ has invited us to visit the magnificent ceylon fisheries tomorrow in your company he did it kindly and behaved like a real gentleman he said nothing more nothing more sir except that he had already spoken to you of this little walk sir said conseil would you give us some details of the pearl fishery as to the fishing itself i asked or the incidents which on the fishing replied the canadian before entering upon the ground it is as well to know something about it very well sit down my friends and i will teach you ned and conseil seated themselves on an ottoman and the first thing the canadian asked was sir what is a pearl my worthy ned i answered to the poet a pearl is a tear of the sea to the orientals it is a drop of dew solidified to the ladies it is a jewel of an oblong shape of a brilliancy of motherofpearl substance which they wear on their fingers their necks or their ears for the chemist it is a mixture of phosphate and carbonate of lime with a little gelatine and lastly for naturalists it is simply a morbid secretion of the organ that produces the motherofpearl amongst certain bivalves branch of molluscs said conseil precisely so my learned conseil and amongst these testacea the earshell the tridacnae the turbots in a word all those which secrete motherofpearl that is the blue bluish violet or white substance which lines the interior of their shells are capable of producing pearls mussels too asked the canadian yes mussels of certain waters in scotland wales ireland saxony bohemia and france good for the future i shall pay attention replied the canadian but i continued the particular mollusc which secretes the pearl is the pearloyster the meleagrina margaritifera that precious pintadine the pearl is nothing but a nacreous formation deposited in a globular form either adhering to the oyster shell or buried in the folds of the creature on the shell it is fast in the flesh it is loose but always has for a kernel a small hard substance may be a barren egg may be a grain of sand around which the pearly matter deposits itself year after year successively and by thin concentric layers are many pearls found in the same oyster asked conseil yes my boy some are a perfect casket one oyster has been mentioned though i allow myself to doubt it as having contained no less than a hundred and fifty sharks a hundred and fifty sharks exclaimed ned land did i say sharks said i hurriedly i meant to say a hundred and fifty pearls sharks would not be sense certainly not said conseil but will you tell us now by what means they extract these pearls they proceed in various ways when they adhere to the shell the fishermen often pull them off with pincers but the most common way is to lay the oysters on mats of the seaweed which covers the banks thus they die in the open air and at the end of ten days they are in a forward state of decomposition they are then plunged into large reservoirs of seawater then they are opened and washed the price of these pearls varies according to their size asked conseil not only according to their size i answered but also according to their shape their water that is their colour and their lustre that is that bright and diapered sparkle which makes them so charming to the eye the most beautiful are called virgin pearls or paragons they are formed alone in the tissue of the mollusc are white often opaque and sometimes have the transparency of an opal they are generally round or oval the round are made into bracelets the oval into pendants and being more precious are sold singly those adhering to the shell of the oyster are more irregular in shape and are sold by weight lastly in a lower order are classed those small pearls known under the name of seedpearls they are sold by measure and are especially used in embroidery for church ornaments but said conseil is this pearlfishery dangerous no i answered quickly particularly if certain precautions are taken what does one risk in such a calling said ned land the swallowing of some mouthfuls of seawater as you say ned by the bye said i trying to take captain nemos careless tone are you afraid of sharks brave ned i replied the canadian a harpooner by profession it is my trade to make light of them but said i it is not a question of fishing for them with an ironswivel hoisting them into the vessel cutting off their tails with a blow of a chopper ripping them up and throwing their heart into the sea then it is a question of precisely in the water in the water faith with a good harpoon you know sir these sharks are illfashioned beasts they turn on their bellies to seize you and in that time ned land had a way of saying seize which made my blood run cold well and you conseil what do you think of sharks me said conseil i will be frank sir so much the better thought i if you sir mean to face the sharks i do not see why your faithful servant should not face them with you chapter iii a pearl of ten millions the next morning at four oclock i was awakened by the steward whom captain nemo had placed at my service i rose hurriedly dressed and went into the saloon captain nemo was awaiting me m aronnax said he are you ready to start i am ready then please to follow me and my companions captain they have been told and are waiting are we not to put on our divers dresses asked i not yet i have not allowed the _nautilus_ to come too near this coast and we are some distance from the manaar bank but the boat is ready and will take us to the exact point of disembarking which will save us a long way it carries our diving apparatus which we will put on when we begin our submarine journey captain nemo conducted me to the central staircase which led on the platform ned and conseil were already there delighted at the idea of the pleasure party which was preparing five sailors from the _nautilus_ with their oars waited in the boat which had been made fast against the side the night was still dark layers of clouds covered the sky allowing but few stars to be seen i looked on the side where the land lay and saw nothing but a dark line enclosing three parts of the horizon from southwest to northwest the _nautilus_ having returned during the night up the western coast of ceylon was now west of the bay or rather gulf formed by the mainland and the island of manaar there under the dark waters stretched the pintadine bank an inexhaustible field of pearls the length of which is more than twenty miles captain nemo ned land conseil and i took our places in the stern of the boat the master went to the tiller his four companions leaned on their oars the painter was cast off and we sheered off the boat went towards the south the oarsmen did not hurry i noticed that their strokes strong in the water only followed each other every ten seconds according to the method generally adopted in the navy whilst the craft was running by its own velocity the liquid drops struck the dark depths of the waves crisply like spats of melted lead a little billow spreading wide gave a slight roll to the boat and some samphire reeds flapped before it we were silent what was captain nemo thinking of perhaps of the land he was approaching and which he found too near to him contrary to the canadians opinion who thought it too far off as to conseil he was merely there from curiosity about halfpast five the first tints on the horizon showed the upper line of coast more distinctly flat enough in the east it rose a little to the south five miles still lay between us and it was indistinct owing to the mist on the water at six oclock it became suddenly daylight with that rapidity peculiar to tropical regions which know neither dawn nor twilight the solar rays pierced the curtain of clouds piled up on the eastern horizon and the radiant orb rose rapidly i saw land distinctly with a few trees scattered here and there the boat neared manaar island which was rounded to the south captain nemo rose from his seat and watched the sea at a sign from him the anchor was dropped but the chain scarcely ran for it was little more than a yard deep and this spot was one of the highest points of the bank of pintadines here we are m aronnax said captain nemo you see that enclosed bay here in a month will be assembled the numerous fishing boats of the exporters and these are the waters their divers will ransack so boldly happily this bay is well situated for that kind of fishing it is sheltered from the strongest winds the sea is never very rough here which makes it favourable for the divers work we will now put on our dresses and begin our walk i did not answer and while watching the suspected waves began with the help of the sailors to put on my heavy seadress captain nemo and my companions were also dressing none of the _nautilus_ men were to accompany us on this new excursion soon we were enveloped to the throat in indiarubber clothing the air apparatus fixed to our backs by braces as to the ruhmkorff apparatus there was no necessity for it before putting my head into the copper cap i had asked the question of the captain they would be useless he replied we are going to no great depth and the solar rays will be enough to light our walk besides it would not be prudent to carry the electric light in these waters its brilliancy might attract some of the dangerous inhabitants of the coast most inopportunely as captain nemo pronounced these words i turned to conseil and ned land but my two friends had already encased their heads in the metal cap and they could neither hear nor answer one last question remained to ask of captain nemo and our arms asked i our guns guns what for do not mountaineers attack the bear with a dagger in their hand and is not steel surer than lead here is a strong blade put it in your belt and we start i looked at my companions they were armed like us and more than that ned land was brandishing an enormous harpoon which he had placed in the boat before leaving the _nautilus_ then following the captains example i allowed myself to be dressed in the heavy copper helmet and our reservoirs of air were at once in activity an instant after we were landed one after the other in about two yards of water upon an even sand captain nemo made a sign with his hand and we followed him by a gentle declivity till we disappeared under the waves over our feet like coveys of snipe in a bog rose shoals of fish of the genus monoptera which have no other fins but their tail i recognized the javanese a real serpent two and a half feet long of a livid colour underneath and which might easily be mistaken for a conger eel if it were not for the golden stripes on its side in the genus stromateus whose bodies are very flat and oval i saw some of the most brilliant colours carrying their dorsal fin like a scythe an excellent eating fish which dried and pickled is known by the name of karawade then some tranquebars belonging to the genus apsiphoroides whose body is covered with a shell cuirass of eight longitudinal plates the heightening sun lit the mass of waters more and more the soil changed by degrees to the fine sand succeeded a perfect causeway of boulders covered with a carpet of molluscs and zoophytes amongst the specimens of these branches i noticed some placenae with thin unequal shells a kind of ostracion peculiar to the red sea and the indian ocean some orange lucinae with rounded shells rockfish three feet and a half long which raised themselves under the waves like hands ready to seize one there were also some panopyres slightly luminous and lastly some oculines like magnificent fans forming one of the richest vegetations of these seas in the midst of these living plants and under the arbours of the hydrophytes were layers of clumsy articulates particularly some raninae whose carapace formed a slightly rounded triangle and some horrible looking parthenopes at about seven oclock we found ourselves at last surveying the oysterbanks on which the pearloysters are reproduced by millions captain nemo pointed with his hand to the enormous heap of oysters and i could well understand that this mine was inexhaustible for natures creative power is far beyond mans instinct of destruction ned land faithful to his instinct hastened to fill a net which he carried by his side with some of the finest specimens but we could not stop we must follow the captain who seemed to guide himself by paths known only to himself the ground was sensibly rising and sometimes on holding up my arm it was above the surface of the sea then the level of the bank would sink capriciously often we rounded high rocks scarped into pyramids in their dark fractures huge crustacea perched upon their high claws like some warmachine watched us with fixed eyes and under our feet crawled various kinds of annelides at this moment there opened before us a large grotto dug in a picturesque heap of rocks and carpeted with all the thick warp of the submarine flora at first it seemed very dark to me the solar rays seemed to be extinguished by successive gradations until its vague transparency became nothing more than drowned light captain nemo entered we followed my eyes soon accustomed themselves to this relative state of darkness i could distinguish the arches springing capriciously from natural pillars standing broad upon their granite base like the heavy columns of tuscan architecture why had our incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt i was soon to know after descending a rather sharp declivity our feet trod the bottom of a kind of circular pit there captain nemo stopped and with his hand indicated an object i had not yet perceived it was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions a gigantic tridacne a goblet which could have contained a whole lake of holywater a basin the breadth of which was more than two yards and a half and consequently larger than that ornamenting the saloon of the _nautilus_ i approached this extraordinary mollusc it adhered by its filaments to a table of granite and there isolated it developed itself in the calm waters of the grotto i estimated the weight of this tridacne at lbs such an oyster would contain lbs of meat and one must have the stomach of a gargantua to demolish some dozens of them captain nemo was evidently acquainted with the existence of this bivalve and seemed to have a particular motive in verifying the actual state of this tridacne the shells were a little open the captain came near and put his dagger between to prevent them from closing then with his hand he raised the membrane with its fringed edges which formed a cloak for the creature there between the folded plaits i saw a loose pearl whose size equalled that of a coconut its globular shape perfect clearness and admirable lustre made it altogether a jewel of inestimable value carried away by my curiosity i stretched out my hand to seize it weigh it and touch it but the captain stopped me made a sign of refusal and quickly withdrew his dagger and the two shells closed suddenly i then understood captain nemos intention in leaving this pearl hidden in the mantle of the tridacne he was allowing it to grow slowly each year the secretions of the mollusc would add new concentric circles i estimated its value at at least after ten minutes captain nemo stopped suddenly i thought he had halted previously to returning no by a gesture he bade us crouch beside him in a deep fracture of the rock his hand pointed to one part of the liquid mass which i watched attentively about five yards from me a shadow appeared and sank to the ground the disquieting idea of sharks shot through my mind but i was mistaken and once again it was not a monster of the ocean that we had anything to do with it was a man a living man an indian a fisherman a poor devil who i suppose had come to glean before the harvest i could see the bottom of his canoe anchored some feet above his head he dived and went up successively a stone held between his feet cut in the shape of a sugar loaf whilst a rope fastened him to his boat helped him to descend more rapidly this was all his apparatus reaching the bottom about five yards deep he went on his knees and filled his bag with oysters picked up at random then he went up emptied it pulled up his stone and began the operation once more which lasted thirty seconds the diver did not see us the shadow of the rock hid us from sight and how should this poor indian ever dream that men beings like himself should be there under the water watching his movements and losing no detail of the fishing several times he went up in this way and dived again he did not carry away more than ten at each plunge for he was obliged to pull them from the bank to which they adhered by means of their strong byssus and how many of those oysters for which he risked his life had no pearl in them i watched him closely his manœuvres were regular and for the space of half an hour no danger appeared to threaten him i was beginning to accustom myself to the sight of this interesting fishing when suddenly as the indian was on the ground i saw him make a gesture of terror rise and make a spring to return to the surface of the sea i understood his dread a gigantic shadow appeared just above the unfortunate diver it was a shark of enormous size advancing diagonally his eyes on fire and his jaws open i was mute with horror and unable to move the voracious creature shot towards the indian who threw himself on one side to avoid the sharks fins but not its tail for it struck his chest and stretched him on the ground this scene lasted but a few seconds the shark returned and turning on his back prepared himself for cutting the indian in two when i saw captain nemo rise suddenly and then dagger in hand walk straight to the monster ready to fight face to face with him the very moment the shark was going to snap the unhappy fisherman in two he perceived his new adversary and turning over made straight towards him i can still see captain nemos position holding himself well together he waited for the shark with admirable coolness and when it rushed at him threw himself on one side with wonderful quickness avoiding the shock and burying his dagger deep into its side but it was not all over a terrible combat ensued illustration a terrible combat began the shark had seemed to roar if i might say so the blood rushed in torrents from its wound the sea was dyed red and through the opaque liquid i could distinguish nothing more nothing more until the moment when like lightning i saw the undaunted captain hanging on to one of the creatures fins struggling as it were hand to hand with the monster and dealing successive blows at his enemy yet still unable to give a decisive one the sharks struggles agitated the water with such fury that the rocking threatened to upset me i wanted to go to the captains assistance but nailed to the spot with horror i could not stir i saw the haggard eye i saw the different phases of the fight the captain fell to the earth upset by the enormous mass which leant upon him the sharks jaws opened wide like a pair of factory shears and it would have been all over with the captain but quick as thought harpoon in hand ned land rushed towards the shark and struck it with its sharp point the waves were impregnated with a mass of blood they rocked under the sharks movements which beat them with indescribable fury ned land had not missed his aim it was the monsters deathrattle struck to the heart it struggled in dreadful convulsions the shock of which overthrew conseil but ned land had disentangled the captain who getting up without any wound went straight to the indian quickly cut the cord which held him to his stone took him in his arms and with a sharp blow of his heel mounted to the surface we all three followed in a few seconds saved by a miracle and reached the fishermans boat captain nemos first care was to recall the unfortunate man to life again i did not think he could succeed i hoped so for the poor creatures immersion was not long but the blow from the sharks tail might have been his deathblow happily with the captains and conseils sharp friction i saw consciousness return by degrees he opened his eyes what was his surprise his terror even at seeing four great copper heads leaning over him and above all what must he have thought when captain nemo drawing from the pocket of his dress a bag of pearls placed it in his hand this munificent charity from the man of the waters to the poor cingalese was accepted with a trembling hand his wondering eyes showed that he knew not to what superhuman beings he owed both fortune and life at a sign from the captain we regained the bank and following the road already traversed came in about half an hour to the anchor which held the canoe of the _nautilus_ to the earth once on board we each with the help of the sailors got rid of the heavy copper helmet captain nemos first word was to the canadian thank you master land said he it was in revenge captain replied ned land i owed you that a ghastly smile passed across the captains lips and that was all to the _nautilus_ said he the boat flew over the waves some minutes after we met the sharks dead body floating by the black marking of the extremity of its fins i recognised the terrible melanopteron of the indian seas of the species of shark so properly called it was more than twentyfive feet long its enormous mouth occupied onethird of its body it was an adult as was known by its six rows of teeth placed in an isosceles triangle in the upper jaw whilst i was contemplating this inert mass a dozen of these voracious beasts appeared round the boat and without noticing us threw themselves upon the dead body and fought with one another for the pieces at halfpast eight we were again on board the _nautilus_ there i reflected on the incidents which had taken place in our excursion to the manaar bank two conclusions i must inevitably draw from itone bearing upon the unparalleled courage of captain nemo the other upon his devotion to a human being a representative of that race from which he fled beneath the sea whatever he might say this strange man had not yet succeeded in entirely crushing his heart when i made this observation to him he answered in a slightly moved tone that indian sir is an inhabitant of an oppressed country and i am still and shall be to my last breath one of them chapter iv the red sea in the course of the day of the th of january the island of ceylon disappeared under the horizon and the _nautilus_ at a speed of twenty miles an hour slid into the labyrinth of canals which separate the maldives from the laccadives it coasted even the island of kiltan a land originally coraline discovered by vasco da gama in and one of the nineteen principal islands of the laccadive archipelago situated between and n lat and e long we had made miles or french leagues from our startingpoint in the japanese seas the next day th january when the _nautilus_ went to the surface of the ocean there was no land in sight its course was nne in the direction of the sea of oman between arabia and the indian peninsula which serves as an outlet to the persian gulf it was evidently a block without any possible egress where was captain nemo taking us to i could not say this however did not satisfy the canadian who that day came to me asking where we were going we are going where our captains fancy takes us master ned his fancy cannot take us far then said the canadian the persian gulf has no outlet and if we do go in it will not be long before we are out again very well then we will come out again master land and if after the persian gulf the _nautilus_ would like to visit the red sea the straits of babelmandeb are there to give us entrance i need not tell you sir said ned land that the red sea is as much closed as the gulf as the isthmus of suez is not yet cut and if it was a boat as mysterious as ours would not risk itself in a canal cut with sluices and again the red sea is not the road to take us back to europe but i never said we were going back to europe what do you suppose then i suppose that after visiting the curious coasts of arabia and egypt the _nautilus_ will go down the indian ocean again perhaps cross the channel of mozambique perhaps off the mascarenhas so as to gain the cape of good hope and once at the cape of good hope asked the canadian with peculiar emphasis well we shall penetrate into that atlantic which we do not yet know ah friend ned you are getting tired of this journey under the sea you are surfeited with the incessantly varying spectacle of submarine wonders for my part i shall be sorry to see the end of a voyage which it is given to so few men to make for four days till the rd of february the _nautilus_ scoured the sea of oman at various speeds and at various depths it seemed to go at random as if hesitating as to which road it should follow but we never passed the tropic of cancer in quitting this sea we sighted muscat for an instant one of the most important towns of the country of oman i admired its strange aspect surrounded by black rocks upon which its white houses and forts stood in relief i saw the rounded domes of its mosques the elegant points of its minarets its fresh and verdant terraces but it was only a vision the _nautilus_ soon sank under the waves of that part of the sea we passed along the arabian coast of mahrah and hadramaut for a distance of six miles its undulating line of mountains being occasionally relieved by some ancient ruin the th of february we at last entered the gulf of aden a perfect funnel introduced into the neck of babelmandeb through which the indian waters entered the red sea the th of february the _nautilus_ floated in sight of aden perched upon a promontory which a narrow isthmus joins to the mainland a kind of inaccessible gibraltar the fortifications of which were rebuilt by the english after taking possession in i caught a glimpse of the octagon minarets of this town which was at one time the richest commercial magazine on the coast i certainly thought that captain nemo arrived at this point would back out again but i was mistaken for he did no such thing much to my surprise the next day the th of february we entered the straits of babelmandeb the name of which in the arab tongue means the gate of tears to twenty miles in breadth it is only thirtytwo in length and for the _nautilus_ starting at full speed the crossing was scarcely the work of an hour but i saw nothing not even the island of perim with which the british government has fortified the position of aden there were too many english or french steamers of the line of suez to bombay calcutta to melbourne and from bourbon to the mauritius furrowing this narrow passage for the _nautilus_ to venture to show itself so it remained prudently below at last about noon we were in the waters of the red sea i would not even seek to understand the caprice which had decided captain nemo upon entering the gulf but i quite approved of the _nautilus_ entering it its speed was lessened sometimes it kept on the surface sometimes it dived to avoid a vessel and thus i was able to observe the upper and lower parts of this curious sea the th of february from the first dawn of day mocha came in sight now a ruined town whose walls would fall at a gunshot yet which shelters here and there some verdant datetrees once an important city containing six public markets and twentysix mosques and whose walls defended by fourteen forts formed a girdle of two miles in circumference the _nautilus_ then approached the african shore where the depth of the sea was greater there between two waters clear as crystal through the open panels we were allowed to contemplate the beautiful bushes of brilliant coral and large blocks of rock clothed with a splendid fur of green algæ and fuci what an indescribable spectacle and what variety of sites and landscapes along these sandbanks and volcanic islands which bound the libyan coast but where these shrubs appeared in all their beauty was on the eastern coast which the _nautilus_ soon gained it was on the coast of tehama for there not only did this display of zoophytes flourish beneath the level of the sea but they also formed picturesque interlacings which unfolded themselves about sixty feet above the surface more capricious but less highly coloured than those whose freshness was kept up by the vital power of the waters what charming hours i passed thus at the window of the saloon what new specimens of submarine flora and fauna did i admire under the brightness of our electric lantern the th of february the _nautilus_ floated in the broadest part of the red sea which is comprised between souakin on the west coast and komfidah on the east coast with a diameter of ninety miles that day at noon after the bearings were taken captain nemo mounted the platform where i happened to be and i was determined not to let him go down again without at least pressing him regarding his ulterior projects as soon as he saw me he approached and graciously offered me a cigar well sir does this red sea please you have you sufficiently observed the wonders it covers its fishes its zoophytes its parterres of sponges and its forests of coral did you catch a glimpse of the towns on its borders yes captain nemo i replied and the _nautilus_ is wonderfully fitted for such a study ah it is an intelligent boat yes sir intelligent and invulnerable it fears neither the terrible tempests of the red sea nor its currents nor its sandbanks certainly said i this sea is quoted as one of the worst and in the time of the ancients if i am not mistaken its reputation was detestable detestable m aronnax the greek and latin historians do not speak favourably of it and strabo says it is very dangerous during the etesian winds and in the rainy season the arabian edrisi portrays it under the name of the gulf of colzoum and relates that vessels perished there in great numbers on the sandbanks and that no one would risk sailing in the night it is he pretends a sea subject to fearful hurricanes strewn with inhospitable islands and which offers nothing good either on its surface or in its depths one may see i replied that these historians never sailed on board the _nautilus_ just so replied the captain smiling and in that respect moderns are not more advanced than the ancients it required many ages to find out the mechanical power of steam who knows if in another hundred years we may not see a second _nautilus_ progress is slow m aronnax it is true i answered your boat is at least a century before its time perhaps an era what a misfortune that the secret of such an invention should die with its inventor captain nemo did not reply after some minutes silence he continued you were speaking of the opinions of ancient historians upon the dangerous navigation of the red sea it is true said i but were not their fears exaggerated yes and no m aronnax replied captain nemo who seemed to know the red sea by heart that which is no longer dangerous for a modern vessel well rigged strongly built and master of its own course thanks to obedient steam offered all sorts of perils to the ships of the ancients picture to yourself those first navigators venturing in ships made of planks sewn with the cords of the palmtree saturated with the grease of the seadog and covered with powdered resin they had not even instruments wherewith to take their bearings and they went by guess amongst currents of which they scarcely knew anything under such conditions shipwrecks were and must have been numerous but in our time steamers running between suez and the south seas have nothing more to fear from the fury of this gulf in spite of contrary tradewinds the captain and passengers do not prepare for their departure by offering propitiatory sacrifices and on their return they no longer go ornamented with wreaths and gilt fillets to thank the gods in the neighbouring temple i agree with you said i and steam seems to have killed all gratitude in the hearts of sailors but captain since you seem to have especially studied this sea can you tell me the origin of its name there exist several explanations on the subject m aronnax would you like to know the opinion of a chronicler of the fourteenth century willingly this fanciful writer pretends that its name was given to it after the passage of the israelites when pharaoh perished in the waves which closed at the voice of moses a poets explanation captain nemo i replied but i cannot content myself with that i ask you for your personal opinion here it is m aronnax according to my idea we must see in this appellation of the red sea a translation of the hebrew word edom and if the ancients gave it that name it was on account of the particular colour of its waters but up to this time i have seen nothing but transparent waves and without any particular colour very likely but as we advance to the bottom of the gulf you will see this singular appearance i remember seeing the bay of tor entirely red like a sea of blood and you attribute this colour to the presence of a microscopic seaweed yes so captain nemo it is not the first time you have overrun the red sea on board the _nautilus_ no sir as you spoke a while ago of the passage of the israelites and of the catastrophe to the egyptians i will ask whether you have met with the traces under the water of this great historical fact no sir and for a good reason what is it it is that the spot where moses and his people passed is now so blocked up with sand that the camels can barely bathe their legs there you can well understand that there would not be water enough for my _nautilus_ and the spot i asked the spot is situated a little above the isthmus of suez in the arm which formerly made a deep estuary when the red sea extended to the salt lakes now whether this passage were miraculous or not the israelites nevertheless crossed there to reach the promised land and pharaohs army perished precisely on that spot and i think that excavations made in the middle of the sand would bring to light a large number of arms and instruments of egyptian origin that is evident i replied and for the sake of archaeologists let us hope that these excavations will be made sooner or later when new towns are established on the isthmus after the construction of the suez canal a canal however very useless to a vessel like the _nautilus_ very likely but useful to the whole world said captain nemo the ancients well understood the utility of a communication between the red sea and the mediterranean for their commercial affairs but they did not think of digging a canal direct and took the nile as an intermediate very probably the canal which united the nile to the red sea was begun by sesostris if we may believe tradition one thing is certain that in the year before jesus christ necos undertook the works of an alimentary canal to the waters of the nile across the plain of egypt looking towards arabia it took four days to go up this canal and it was so wide that two triremes could go abreast it was carried on by darius the son of hystaspes and probably finished by ptolemy ii strabo saw it navigated but its decline from the point of departure near bubastes to the red sea was so slight that it was only navigable for a few months in the year this canal answered all commercial purposes to the age of antonius when it was abandoned and blocked up with sand restored by order of the caliph omar it was definitely destroyed in or by caliph almansor who wished to prevent the arrival of provisions to mohammedbenabdallah who had revolted against him during the expedition into egypt your general bonaparte discovered traces of the works in the desert of suez and surprised by the tide he nearly perished before regaining hadjaroth at the very place where moses had encamped three thousand years before him well captain what the ancients dared not undertake this junction between the two seas which will shorten the road from cadiz to india m lesseps has succeeded in doing and before long he will have changed africa into an immense island yes m aronnax you have the right to be proud of your countryman such a man brings more honour to a nation than great captains he began like so many others with disgust and rebuffs but he has triumphed for he has the genius of will and it is sad to think that a work like that which ought to have been an international work and which would have sufficed to make a reign illustrious should have succeeded by the energy of one man all honour to m lesseps yes honour to the great citizen i replied surprised by the manner in which captain nemo had just spoken unfortunately he continued i cannot take you through the suez canal but you will be able to see the long jetty of port said after tomorrow when we shall be in the mediterranean the mediterranean i exclaimed yes sir does that astonish you what astonishes me is to think that we shall be there the day after tomorrow indeed yes captain although by this time i ought to have accustomed myself to be surprised at nothing since i have been on board your boat but the cause of this surprise well it is the fearful speed you will have to put on the _nautilus_ if the day after tomorrow she is to be in the mediterranean having made the round of africa and doubled the cape of good hope who told you that she would make the round of africa and double the cape of good hope sir well unless the _nautilus_ sails on dry land and passes above the isthmus or beneath it m aronnax beneath it certainly replied captain nemo quietly a long time ago nature made under this tongue of land what man has this day made on its surface what such a passage exists yes a subterranean passage which i have named the arabian tunnel it takes us beneath suez and opens into the gulf of pelusium but this isthmus is composed of nothing but quicksands to a certain depth but at fiftyfive yards only there is a solid layer of rock did you discover this passage by chance i asked more and more surprised chance and reasoning sir and by reasoning even more than by chance not only does this passage exist but i have profited by it several times without that i should not have ventured this day into the impassable red sea i noticed that in the red sea and in the mediterranean there existed a certain number of fishes of a kind perfectly identical certain of the fact i asked myself was it possible that there was no communication between the two seas if there was the subterranean current must necessarily run from the red sea to the mediterranean from the sole cause of difference of level i caught a large number of fishes in the neighbourhood of suez i passed a copper ring through their tails and threw them back into the sea some months later on the coast of syria i caught some of my fish ornamented with the ring thus the communication between the two was proved i then sought for it with my _nautilus_ i discovered it ventured into it and before long sir you too will have passed through my arabian tunnel chapter v the arabian tunnel that same evening in n lat the _nautilus_ floated on the surface of the sea approaching the arabian coast i saw djeddah the most important countinghouse of egypt syria turkey and india i distinguished clearly enough its buildings the vessels anchored at the quays and those whose draught of water obliged them to anchor in the roads the sun rather low on the horizon struck full on the houses of the town bringing out their whiteness outside some wooden cabins and some made of reeds showed the quarter inhabited by the bedouins soon djeddah was shut out from view by the shadows of night and the _nautilus_ found herself under water slightly phosphorescent the next day the th of february we sighted several ships running to windward the _nautilus_ returned to its submarine navigation but at noon when her bearings were taken the sea being deserted she rose again to her waterline accompanied by ned and conseil i seated myself on the platform the coast on the eastern side looked like a mass faintly printed upon a damp fog we were leaning on the sides of the pinnace talking of one thing and another when ned land stretching out his hand towards a spot on the sea said do you see anything there sir no ned i replied but i have not your eyes you know look well said ned there on the starboard beam about the height of the lantern do you not see a mass which seems to move certainly said i after close attention i see something like a long black body on the top of the water and certainly before long the black object was not more than a mile from us it looked like a great sandbank deposited in the open sea it was a gigantic dugong ned land looked eagerly his eyes shone with covetousness at the sight of the animal his hand seemed ready to harpoon it one would have thought he was awaiting the moment to throw himself into the sea and attack it in its element at this instant captain nemo appeared on the platform he saw the dugong understood the canadians attitude and addressing him said if you held a harpoon just now master land would it not burn your hand just so sir and you would not be sorry to go back for one day to your trade of a fisherman and to add this cetacean to the list of those you have already killed i should not sir well you can try thank you sir said ned land his eyes flaming only continued the captain i advise you for your own sake not to miss the creature is the dugong dangerous to attack i asked in spite of the canadians shrug of the shoulders yes replied the captain sometimes the animal turns upon its assailants and overturns their boat but for master land this danger is not to be feared his eye is prompt his arm sure at this moment seven men of the crew mute and immovable as ever mounted the platform one carried a harpoon and a line similar to those employed in catching whales the pinnace was lifted from the bridge pulled from its socket and let down into the sea six oarsmen took their seats and the coxswain went to the tiller ned conseil and i went to the back of the boat you are not coming captain i asked no sir but i wish you good sport the boat put off and lifted by the six rowers drew rapidly towards the dugong which floated about two miles from the _nautilus_ arrived some cableslength from the cetacean the speed slackened and the oars dipped noiselessly into the quiet waters ned land harpoon in hand stood in the fore part of the boat the harpoon used for striking the whale is generally attached to a very long cord which runs out rapidly as the wounded creature draws it after him but here the cord was not more than ten fathoms long and the extremity was attached to a small barrel which by floating was to show the course the dugong took under the water i stood and carefully watched the canadians adversary this dugong which also bears the name of the halicore closely resembles the manatee its oblong body terminated in a lengthened tail and its lateral fins in perfect fingers its difference from the manatee consisted in its upper jaw which was armed with two long and pointed teeth which formed on each side diverging tusks this dugong which ned land was preparing to attack was of colossal dimensions it was more than seven yards long it did not move and seemed to be sleeping on the waves which circumstance made it easier to capture the boat approached within six yards of the animal the oars rested on the rowlocks i half rose ned land his body thrown a little back brandished the harpoon in his experienced hand suddenly a hissing noise was heard and the dugong disappeared the harpoon although thrown with great force had apparently only struck the water curse it exclaimed the canadian furiously i have missed it no said i the creature is woundedlook at the blood but your weapon has not stuck in his body my harpoon my harpoon cried ned land the sailors rowed on and the coxswain made for the floating barrel the harpoon regained we followed in pursuit of the animal the latter came now and then to the surface to breathe its wound had not weakened it for it shot onwards with great rapidity the boat rowed by strong arms flew on its track several times it approached within some few yards and the canadian was ready to strike but the dugong made off with a sudden plunge and it was impossible to reach it imagine the passion which excited impatient ned land he hurled at the unfortunate creature the most energetic expletives in the english tongue for my part i was only vexed to see the dugong escape all our attacks we pursued it without relaxation for an hour and i began to think it would prove difficult to capture when the animal possessed with the perverse idea of vengeance of which he had cause to repent turned upon the pinnace and assailed us in its turn this manœuvre did not escape the canadian look out he cried the coxswain said some words in his outlandish tongue doubtless warning the men to keep on their guard the dugong came within twenty feet of the boat stopped sniffed the air briskly with its large nostrils not pierced at the extremity but in the upper part of its muzzle then taking a spring he threw himself upon us the pinnace could not avoid the shock and half upset shipped at least two tons of water which had to be emptied but thanks to the coxswain we caught it sideways not full front so we were not quite overturned while ned land clinging to the bows belaboured the gigantic animal with blows from his harpoon the creatures teeth were buried in the gunwale and it lifted the whole thing out of the water as a lion does a roebuck we were upset over one another and i know not how the adventure would have ended if the canadian still enraged with the beast had not struck it to the heart i heard its teeth grind on the iron plate and the dugong disappeared carrying the harpoon with him but the barrel soon returned to the surface and shortly after the body of the animal turned on its back the boat came up with it took it in tow and made straight for the _nautilus_ it required tackle of enormous strength to hoist the dugong on to the platform it weighed lbs the next day th february the larder of the _nautilus_ was enriched by some more delicate game a flight of seaswallows rested on the _nautilus_ it was a species of the sterna nilotica peculiar to egypt its beak is black head grey and pointed the eye surrounded by white spots the back wings and tail of a greyish colour the belly and throat white and claws red they also took some dozen of nile ducks a wild bird of high flavour its throat and upper part of the head white with black spots about five oclock in the evening we sighted to the north the cape of rasmohammed this cape forms the extremity of arabia petraea comprised between the gulf of suez and the gulf of acabah the _nautilus_ penetrated into the straits of jubal which leads to the gulf of suez i distinctly saw a high mountain towering between the two gulfs of rasmohammed it was mount horeb that sinai at the top of which moses saw god face to face at six oclock the _nautilus_ sometimes floating sometimes immersed passed some distance from tor situated at the end of the bay the waters of which seemed tinted with red an observation already made by captain nemo then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence sometimes broken by the cries of the pelican and other nightbirds and the noise of the waves breaking upon the shore chafing against the rocks or the panting of some faroff steamer beating the waters of the gulf with its noisy paddles from eight to nine oclock the _nautilus_ remained some fathoms under the water according to my calculation we must have been very near suez through the panel of the saloon i saw the bottom of the rocks brilliantly lit up by our electric lamp we seemed to be leaving the straits behind us more and more at a quarterpast nine the vessel having returned to the surface i mounted the platform most impatient to pass through captain nemos tunnel i could not stay in one place so came to breathe the fresh night air soon in the shadow i saw a pale light half discoloured by the fog shining about a mile from us a floating lighthouse said someone near me i turned and saw the captain it is the floating light of suez he continued it will not be long before we gain the entrance of the tunnel the entrance cannot be easy no sir for that reason i am accustomed to go into the steersmans cage and myself direct our course and now if you will go down m aronnax the _nautilus_ is going under the waves and will not return to the surface until we have passed through the arabian tunnel captain nemo led me towards the central staircase half way down he opened a door traversed the upper deck and landed in the pilots cage which it may be remembered rose at the extremity of the platform it was a cabin measuring six feet square very much like that occupied by the pilot on the steamboats of the mississippi or hudson in the midst worked a wheel placed vertically and caught to the tillerrope which ran to the back of the _nautilus_ four lightports with lenticular glasses let in a groove in the partition of the cabin allowed the man at the wheel to see in all directions this cabin was dark but soon my eyes accustomed themselves to the obscurity and i perceived the pilot a strong man with his hands resting on the spokes of the wheel outside the sea appeared vividly lit up by the lantern which shed its rays from the back of the cabin to the other extremity of the platform now said captain nemo let us try to make our passage electric wires connected the pilots cage with the machinery room and from there the captain could communicate simultaneously to his _nautilus_ the direction and the speed he pressed a metal knob and at once the speed of the screw diminished i looked in silence at the high straight wall we were running by at this moment the immovable base of a massive sandy coast we followed it thus for an hour only some few yards off captain nemo did not take his eye from the knob suspended by its two concentric circles in the cabin at a simple gesture the pilot modified the course of the _nautilus_ every instant i had placed myself at the portscuttle and saw some magnificent substructures of coral zoophytes seaweed and fucus agitating their enormous claws which stretched out from the fissures of the rock at a quarterpast ten the captain himself took the helm a large gallery black and deep opened before us the _nautilus_ went boldly into it a strange roaring was heard round its sides it was the waters of the red sea which the incline of the tunnel precipitated violently towards the mediterranean the _nautilus_ went with the torrent rapid as an arrow in spite of the efforts of the machinery which in order to offer more effective resistance beat the waves with reversed screw on the walls of the narrow passage i could see nothing but brilliant rays straight lines furrows of fire traced by the great speed under the brilliant electric light my heart beat fast at thirtyfive minutes past ten captain nemo quitted the helm and turning to me said the mediterranean in less than twenty minutes the _nautilus_ carried along by the torrent had passed through the isthmus of suez chapter vi the grecian archipelago the next day the th of february at the dawn of day the _nautilus_ rose to the surface i hastened on to the platform three miles to the south the dim outline of pelusium was to be seen a torrent had carried us from one sea to another about seven oclock ned and conseil joined me well sir naturalist said the canadian in a slightly jovial tone and the mediterranean we are floating on its surface friend ned what said conseil this very night yes this very night in a few minutes we have passed this impassable isthmus i do not believe it replied the canadian then you are wrong master land i continued this low coast which rounds off to the south is the egyptian coast and you who have such good eyes ned you can see the jetty of port said stretching into the sea the canadian looked attentively certainly you are right sir and your captain is a firstrate man we are in the mediterranean good now if you please let us talk of our own little affair but so that no one hears us i saw what the canadian wanted and in any case i thought it better to let him talk as he wished it so we all three went and sat down near the lantern where we were less exposed to the spray of the blades now ned we listen what have you to tell us what i have to tell you is very simple we are in europe and before captain nemos caprices drag us once more to the bottom of the polar seas or lead us into oceania i ask to leave the _nautilus_ i wished in no way to shackle the liberty of my companions but i certainly felt no desire to leave captain nemo thanks to him and thanks to his apparatus i was each day nearer the completion of my submarine studies and i was rewriting my book of submarine depths in its very element should i ever again have such an opportunity of observing the wonders of the ocean no certainly not and i could not bring myself to the idea of abandoning the _nautilus_ before the cycle of investigation was accomplished friend ned answer me frankly are you tired of being on board are you sorry that destiny has thrown us into captain nemos hands the canadian remained some moments without answering then crossing his arms he said frankly i do not regret this journey under the seas i shall be glad to have made it but now that it is made let us have done with it that is my idea it will come to an end ned where and when where i do not knowwhen i cannot say or rather i suppose it will end when these seas have nothing more to teach us then what do you hope for demanded the canadian that circumstances may occur as well six months hence as now by which we may and ought to profit oh said ned land and where shall we be in six months if you please sir naturalist perhaps in china you know the _nautilus_ is a rapid traveller it goes through water as swallows through the air or as an express on the land it does not fear frequented seas who can say that it may not beat the coasts of france england or america on which flight may be attempted as advantageously as here m aronnax replied the canadian your arguments are rotten at the foundation you speak in the future we shall be there we shall be here i speak in the present we are here and we must profit by it ned lands logic pressed me hard and i felt myself beaten on that ground i knew not what argument would now tell in my favour sir continued ned let us suppose an impossibility if captain nemo should this day offer you your liberty would you accept it i do not know i answered and if he added the offer made you this day was never to be renewed would you accept it friend ned this is my answer your reasoning is against me we must not rely on captain nemos goodwill common prudence forbids him to set us at liberty on the other side prudence bids us profit by the first opportunity to leave the _nautilus_ well m aronnax that is wisely said only one observationjust one the occasion must be serious and our first attempt must succeed if it fails we shall never find another and captain nemo will never forgive us all that is true replied the canadian but your observation applies equally to all attempts at flight whether in two years time or in two days but the question is still this if a favourable opportunity presents itself it must be seized agreed and now ned will you tell me what you mean by a favourable opportunity it will be that which on a dark night will bring the _nautilus_ a short distance from some european coast and you will try and save yourself by swimming yes if we were near enough to the bank and if the vessel was floating at the time not if the bank was far away and the boat was under the water and in that case in that case i should seek to make myself master of the pinnace i know how it is worked we must get inside and the bolts once drawn we shall come to the surface of the water without even the pilot who is in the bows perceiving our flight well ned watch for the opportunity but do not forget that a hitch will ruin us i will not forget sir and now ned would you like to know what i think of your project certainly m aronnax well i thinki do not say i hopei think that this favourable opportunity will never present itself why not because captain nemo cannot hide from himself that we have not given up all hope of regaining our liberty and he will be on his guard above all in the seas and in the sight of european coasts we shall see replied ned land shaking his head determinedly and now ned land i added let us stop here not another word on the subject the day that you are ready come and let us know and we will follow you i rely entirely upon you thus ended a conversation which at no very distant time led to such grave results i must say here that facts seemed to confirm my foresight to the canadians great despair did captain nemo distrust us in these frequented seas or did he only wish to hide himself from the numerous vessels of all nations which ploughed the mediterranean i could not tell but we were oftener between waters and far from the coast or if the _nautilus_ did emerge nothing was to be seen but the pilots cage and sometimes it went to great depths for between the grecian archipelago and asia minor we could not touch the bottom by more than a thousand fathoms thus i only knew we were near the island of carpathos one of the sporades by captain nemo reciting these lines from virgil est carpathio neptuni gurgite vates caeruleus proteus as he pointed to a spot on the planisphere it was indeed the ancient abode of proteus the old shepherd of neptunes flocks now the island of scarpanto situated between rhodes and crete i saw nothing but the granite base through the glass panels of the saloon the next day the th of february i resolved to employ some hours in studying the fishes of the archipelago but for some reason or other the panels remained hermetically sealed upon taking the course of the _nautilus_ i found that we were going towards candia the ancient isle of crete at the time i embarked on the _abraham lincoln_ the whole of this island had risen in insurrection against the despotism of the turks but how the insurgents had fared since that time i was absolutely ignorant and it was not captain nemo deprived of all land communications who could tell me i made no allusion to this event when that night i found myself alone with him in the saloon besides he seemed to be taciturn and preoccupied then contrary to his custom he ordered both panels to be opened and going from one to the other observed the mass of waters attentively to what end i could not guess so on my side i employed my time in studying the fish passing before my eyes in the midst of the waters a man appeared a diver carrying at his belt a leathern purse it was not a body abandoned to the waves it was a living man swimming with a strong hand disappearing occasionally to take breath at the surface i turned towards captain nemo and in an agitated voice exclaimed a man shipwrecked he must be saved at any price illustration a man a shipwrecked sailor i cried the captain did not answer me but came and leaned against the panel the man had approached and with his face flattened against the glass was looking at us to my great amazement captain nemo signed to him the diver answered with his hand mounted immediately to the surface of the water and did not appear again do not be uncomfortable said captain nemo it is nicholas of cape matapan surnamed pesca he is well known in all the cyclades a bold diver water is his element and he lives more in it than on land going continually from one island to another even as far as crete you know him captain why not m aronnax saying which captain nemo went towards a piece of furniture standing near the left panel of the saloon near this piece of furniture i saw a chest bound with iron on the cover of which was a copper plate bearing the cypher of the _nautilus_ with its device at that moment the captain without noticing my presence opened the piece of furniture a sort of strong box which held a great many ingots they were ingots of gold from whence came this precious metal which represented an enormous sum where did the captain gather this gold from and what was he going to do with it i did not say one word i looked captain nemo took the ingots one by one and arranged them methodically in the chest which he filled entirely i estimated the contents at more than lbs weight of gold that is to say nearly the chest was securely fastened and the captain wrote an address on the lid in characters which must have belonged to modern greece this done captain nemo pressed a knob the wire of which communicated with the quarters of the crew four men appeared and not without some trouble pushed the chest out of the saloon then i heard them hoisting it up the iron staircase by means of pulleys at that moment captain nemo turned to me and you were saying sir said he i was saying nothing captain then sir if you will allow me i will wish you good night whereupon he turned and left the saloon i returned to my room much troubled as one may believe i vainly tried to sleepi sought the connecting link between the apparition of the diver and the chest filled with gold soon i felt by certain movements of pitching and tossing that the _nautilus_ was leaving the depths and returning to the surface then i heard steps upon the platform and i knew they were unfastening the pinnace and launching it upon the waves for one instant it struck the side of the _nautilus_ then all noise ceased two hours after the same noise the same going and coming was renewed the boat was hoisted on board replaced in its socket and the _nautilus_ again plunged under the waves so these millions had been transported to their address to what point of the continent who was captain nemos correspondent the next day i related to conseil and the canadian the events of the night which had excited my curiosity to the highest degree my companions were not less surprised than myself but where does he take his millions to asked ned land to that there was no possible answer i returned to the saloon after having breakfast and set to work till five oclock in the evening i employed myself in arranging my notes at that momentought i to attribute it to some peculiar idiosyncrasyi felt so great a heat that i was obliged to take off my coat it was strange for we were under low latitudes and even then the _nautilus_ submerged as it was ought to experience no change of temperature i looked at the manometer it showed a depth of sixty feet to which atmospheric heat could never attain i continued my work but the temperature rose to such a pitch as to be intolerable could there be fire on board i asked myself i was leaving the saloon when captain nemo entered he approached the thermometer consulted it and turning to me said fortytwo degrees i have noticed it captain i replied and if it gets much hotter we cannot bear it oh sir it will not get hotter if we do not wish it you can reduce it as you please then no but i can go farther from the stove which produces it it is outward then certainly we are floating in a current of boiling water is it possible i exclaimed look the panels opened and i saw the sea entirely white all round a sulphurous smoke was curling amid the waves which boiled like water in a copper i placed my hand on one of the panes of glass but the heat was so great that i quickly took it off again where are we i asked near the island of santorin sir replied the captain i wished to give you a sight of the curious spectacle of a submarine eruption i thought said i that the formation of these new islands was ended nothing is ever ended in the volcanic parts of the sea replied captain nemo and the globe is always being worked by subterranean fires already in the nineteenth year of our era according to cassiodorus and pliny a new island theia the divine appeared in the very place where these islets have recently been formed then they sank under the waves to rise again in the year when they again subsided since that time to our days the plutonian work has been suspended but on the rd of february a new island which they named george island emerged from the midst of the sulphurous vapour near nea kamenni and settled again the th of the same month seven days after the th of february the island of aphroessa appeared leaving between nea kamenni and itself a canal ten yards broad i was in these seas when the phenomenon occurred and i was able therefore to observe all the different phases the island of aphroessa of round form measured feet in diameter and feet in height it was composed of black and vitreous lava mixed with fragments of felspar and lately on the th of march a smaller island called reka showed itself near nea kamenni and since then these three have joined together forming but one and the same island and the canal in which we are at this moment i asked here it is replied captain nemo showing me a map of the archipelago you see i have marked the new islands i returned to the glass the _nautilus_ was no longer moving the heat was becoming unbearable the sea which till now had been white was red owing to the presence of salts of iron in spite of the ships being hermetically sealed an insupportable smell of sulphur filled the saloon and the brilliancy of the electricity was entirely extinguished by bright scarlet flames i was in a bath i was choking i was broiled we can remain no longer in this boiling water said i to the captain it would not be prudent replied the impassive captain nemo an order was given the _nautilus_ tacked about and left the furnace it could not brave with impunity a quarter of an hour after we were breathing fresh air on the surface the thought then struck me that if ned land had chosen this part of the sea for our flight we should never have come alive out of this sea of fire the next day the th of february we left the basin which between rhodes and alexandria is reckoned about fathoms in depth and the _nautilus_ passing some distance from cerigo quitted the grecian archipelago after having doubled cape matapan chapter vii the mediterranean in fortyeight hours the mediterranean the blue sea par excellence the great sea of the hebrews the sea of the greeks the mare nostrum of the romans bordered by orangetrees aloes cacti and seapines embalmed with the perfume of the myrtle surrounded by rude mountains saturated with pure and transparent air but incessantly worked by underground fires a perfect battlefield in which neptune and pluto still dispute the empire of the world it is upon these banks and on these waters says michelet that man is renewed in one of the most powerful climates of the globe but beautiful as it was i could only take a rapid glance at the basin whose superficial area is two million of square yards even captain nemos knowledge was lost to me for this puzzling person did not appear once during our passage at full speed i estimated the course which the _nautilus_ took under the waves of the sea at about six hundred leagues and it was accomplished in fortyeight hours starting on the morning of the th of february from the shores of greece we had crossed the straits of gibraltar by sunrise on the th it was plain to me that this mediterranean enclosed in the midst of those countries which he wished to avoid was distasteful to captain nemo those waves and those breezes brought back too many remembrances if not too many regrets here he had no longer that independence and that liberty of gait which he had when in the open seas and his _nautilus_ felt itself cramped between the close shores of africa and europe our speed was now twentyfive miles an hour it may be well understood that ned land to his great disgust was obliged to renounce his intended flight he could not launch the pinnace going at the rate of twelve or thirteen yards every second to quit the _nautilus_ under such conditions would be as bad as jumping from a train going at full speedan imprudent thing to say the least of it besides our vessel only mounted to the surface of the waves at night to renew its stock of air it was steered entirely by the compass and the log i saw no more of the interior of this mediterranean than a traveller by express train perceives of the landscape which flies before his eyes that is to say the distant horizon and not the nearer objects which pass like a flash of lightning we were then passing between sicily and the coast of tunis in the narrow space between cape bon and the straits of messina the bottom of the sea rose almost suddenly there was a perfect bank on which there was not more than nine fathoms of water whilst on either side the depth was ninety fathoms the _nautilus_ had to manœuvre very carefully so as not to strike against this submarine barrier i showed conseil on the map of the mediterranean the spot occupied by this reef but if you please sir observed conseil it is like a real isthmus joining europe to africa yes my boy it forms a perfect bar to the straits of lybia and the soundings of smith have proved that in former times the continents between cape boco and cape furina were joined i can well believe it said conseil i will add i continued that a similar barrier exists between gibraltar and ceuta which in geological times formed the entire mediterranean what if some volcanic burst should one day raise these two barriers above the waves it is not probable conseil well but allow me to finish please sir if this phenomenon should take place it will be troublesome for m lesseps who has taken so much pains to pierce the isthmus i agree with you but i repeat conseil this phenomenon will never happen the violence of subterranean force is ever diminishing volcanoes so plentiful in the first days of the world are being extinguished by degrees the internal heat is weakened the temperature of the lower strata of the globe is lowered by a perceptible quantity every century to the detriment of our globe for its heat is its life but the sun the sun is not sufficient conseil can it give heat to a dead body not that i know of well my friend this earth will one day be that cold corpse it will become uninhabitable and uninhabited like the moon which has long since lost all its vital heat in how many centuries in some hundreds of thousands of years my boy then said conseil we shall have time to finish our journeythat is if ned land does not interfere with it and conseil reassured returned to the study of the bank which the _nautilus_ was skirting at a moderate speed during the night of the th and th february we had entered the second mediterranean basin the greatest depth of which was fathoms the _nautilus_ by the action of its screw slid down the inclined planes and buried itself in the lowest depths of the sea on the th of february about three oclock in the morning we were at the entrance of the straits of gibraltar there once existed two currents an upper one long since recognised which conveys the waters of the ocean into the basin of the mediterranean and a lower countercurrent which reasoning has now shown to exist indeed the volume of water in the mediterranean incessantly added to by the waves of the atlantic and by rivers falling into it would each year raise the level of this sea for its evaporation is not sufficient to restore the equilibrium as it is not so we must necessarily admit the existence of an undercurrent which empties into the basin of the atlantic through the straits of gibraltar the surplus waters of the mediterranean a fact indeed and it was this countercurrent by which the _nautilus_ profited it advanced rapidly by the narrow pass for one instant i caught a glimpse of the beautiful ruins of the temple of hercules buried in the ground according to pliny and with the low island which supports it and a few minutes later we were floating on the atlantic chapter viii vigo bay the atlantic a vast sheet of water whose superficial area covers twentyfive millions of square miles the length of which is nine thousand miles with a mean breadth of two thousand seven hundredan ocean whose parallel winding shores embrace an immense circumference watered by the largest rivers of the world the st lawrence the mississippi the amazon the plata the orinoco the niger the senegal the elbe the loire and the rhine which carry water from the most civilised as well as from the most savage countries magnificent field of water incessantly ploughed by vessels of every nation sheltered by the flags of every nation and which terminates in those two terrible points so dreaded by mariners cape horn and the cape of tempests the _nautilus_ was piercing the water with its sharp spur after having accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half a distance greater than the great circle of the earth where were we going now and what was reserved for the future the _nautilus_ leaving the straits of gibraltar had gone far out it returned to the surface of the waves and our daily walks on the platform were restored to us i mounted at once accompanied by ned land and conseil at a distance of about twelve miles cape st vincent was dimly to be seen forming the southwestern point of the spanish peninsula a strong southerly gale was blowing the sea was swollen and billowy it made the _nautilus_ rock violently it was almost impossible to keep ones foot on the platform which the heavy rolls of the sea beat over every instant so we descended after inhaling some mouthfuls of fresh air i returned to my room conseil to his cabin but the canadian with a preoccupied air followed me our rapid passage across the mediterranean had not allowed him to put his project into execution and he could not help showing his disappointment when the door of my room was shut he sat down and looked at me silently friend ned said i i understand you but you cannot reproach yourself to have attempted to leave the _nautilus_ under the circumstances would have been folly ned land did not answer his compressed lips and frowning brow showed with him the violent possession this fixed idea had taken of his mind let us see i continued we need not despair yet we are going up the coast of portugal again france and england are not far off where we can easily find refuge now if the _nautilus_ on leaving the straits of gibraltar had gone to the south if it had carried us towards regions where there were no continents i should share your uneasiness but we know now that captain nemo does not fly from civilised seas and in some days i think you can act with security ned land still looked at me fixedly at length his fixed lips parted and he said it is for tonight i drew myself up suddenly i was i admit little prepared for this communication i wanted to answer the canadian but words would not come we agreed to wait for an opportunity continued ned land and the opportunity has arrived this night we shall be but a few miles from the spanish coast it is cloudy the wind blows freely i have your word m aronnax and i rely upon you as i was silent the canadian approached me tonight at nine oclock said he i have warned conseil at that moment captain nemo will be shut up in his room probably in bed neither the engineers nor the ships crew can see us conseil and i will gain the central staircase and you m aronnax will remain in the library two steps from us waiting my signal the oars the mast and the sail are in the canoe i have even succeeded in getting some provisions i have procured an english wrench to unfasten the bolts which attach it to the shell of the _nautilus_ so all is ready till tonight the sea is bad that i allow replied the canadian but we must risk that liberty is worth paying for besides the boat is strong and a few miles with a fair wind to carry us is no great thing who knows but by tomorrow we may be a hundred leagues away let circumstances only favour us and by ten or eleven oclock we shall have landed on some spot of terra firma alive or dead but adieu now till tonight with these words the canadian withdrew leaving me almost dumb i had imagined that the chance gone i should have time to reflect and discuss the matter my obstinate companion had given me no time and after all what could i have said to him ned land was perfectly right there was almost the opportunity to profit by could i retract my word and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the future of my companions tomorrow captain nemo might take us far from all land at that moment a rather loud hissing noise told me that the reservoirs were filling and that the _nautilus_ was sinking under the waves of the atlantic a sad day i passed between the desire of regaining my liberty of action and of abandoning the wonderful _nautilus_ and leaving my submarine studies incomplete what dreadful hours i passed thus sometimes seeing myself and companions safely landed sometimes wishing in spite of my reason that some unforeseen circumstance would prevent the realisation of ned lands project twice i went to the saloon i wished to consult the compass i wished to see if the direction the _nautilus_ was taking was bringing us nearer or taking us farther from the coast but no the _nautilus_ kept in portuguese waters i must therefore take my part and prepare for flight my luggage was not heavy my notes nothing more as to captain nemo i asked myself what he would think of our escape what trouble what wrong it might cause him and what he might do in case of its discovery or failure certainly i had no cause to complain of him on the contrary never was hospitality freer than his in leaving him i could not be taxed with ingratitude no oath bound us to him it was on the strength of circumstances he relied and not upon our word to fix us for ever i had not seen the captain since our visit to the island of santorin would chance bring me to his presence before our departure i wished it and i feared it at the same time i listened if i could hear him walking the room contiguous to mine no sound reached my ear i felt an unbearable uneasiness this day of waiting seemed eternal hours struck too slowly to keep pace with my impatience my dinner was served in my room as usual i ate but little i was too preoccupied i left the table at seven oclock a hundred and twenty minutes i counted them still separated me from the moment in which i was to join ned land my agitation redoubled my pulse beat violently i could not remain quiet i went and came hoping to calm my troubled spirit by constant movement the idea of failure in our bold enterprise was the least painful of my anxieties but the thought of seeing our project discovered before leaving the _nautilus_ of being brought before captain nemo irritated or what was worse saddened at my desertion made my heart beat i wanted to see the saloon for the last time i descended the stairs and arrived in the museum where i had passed so many useful and agreeable hours i looked at all its riches all its treasures like a man on the eve of an eternal exile who was leaving never to return these wonders of nature these masterpieces of art amongst which for so many days my life had been concentrated i was going to abandon them for ever i should like to have taken a last look through the windows of the saloon into the waters of the atlantic but the panels were hermetically closed and a cloak of steel separated me from that ocean which i had not yet explored in passing through the saloon i came near the door let into the angle which opened into the captains room to my great surprise this door was ajar i drew back involuntarily if captain nemo should be in his room he could see me but hearing no sound i drew nearer the room was deserted i pushed open the door and took some steps forward still the same monklike severity of aspect suddenly the clock struck eight the first beat of the hammer on the bell awoke me from my dreams i trembled as if an invisible eye had plunged into my most secret thoughts and i hurried from the room there my eye fell upon the compass our course was still north the log indicated moderate speed the manometer a depth of about sixty feet i returned to my room clothed myself warmlysea boots an otterskin cap a great coat of byssus lined with sealskin i was ready i was waiting the vibration of the screw alone broke the deep silence which reigned on board i listened attentively would no loud voice suddenly inform me that ned land had been surprised in his projected flight a mortal dread hung over me and i vainly tried to regain my accustomed coolness at a few minutes to nine i put my ear to the captains door no noise i left my room and returned to the saloon which was half in obscurity but deserted i opened the door communicating with the library the same insufficient light the same solitude i placed myself near the door leading to the central staircase and there waited for ned lands signal at that moment the trembling of the screw sensibly diminished then it stopped entirely the silence was now only disturbed by the beatings of my own heart suddenly a slight shock was felt and i knew that the _nautilus_ had stopped at the bottom of the ocean my uneasiness increased the canadians signal did not come i felt inclined to join ned land and beg of him to put off his attempt i felt that we were not sailing under our usual conditions at this moment the door of the large saloon opened and captain nemo appeared he saw me and without further preamble began in an amiable tone of voice ah sir i have been looking for you do you know the history of spain now one might know the history of ones own country by heart but in the condition i was at the time with troubled mind and head quite lost i could not have said a word of it well continued captain nemo you heard my question do you know the history of spain very slightly i answered well here are learned men having to learn said the captain come sit down and i will tell you a curious episode in this history sir listen well said he this history will interest you on one side for it will answer a question which doubtless you have not been able to solve i listen captain said i not knowing what my interlocutor was driving at and asking myself if this incident was bearing on our projected flight sir if you have no objection we will go back to you cannot be ignorant that your king louis xiv thinking that the gesture of a potentate was sufficient to bring the pyrenees under his yoke had imposed the duke of anjou his grandson on the spaniards this prince reigned more or less badly under the name of philip v and had a strong party against him abroad indeed the preceding year the royal houses of holland austria and england had concluded a treaty of alliance at the hague with the intention of plucking the crown of spain from the head of philip v and placing it on that of an archduke to whom they prematurely gave the title of charles iii spain must resist this coalition but she was almost entirely unprovided with either soldiers or sailors however money would not fail them provided that their galleons laden with gold and silver from america once entered their ports and about the end of they expected a rich convoy which france was escorting with a fleet of twentythree vessels commanded by admiral chateaurenaud for the ships of the coalition were already beating the atlantic this convoy was to go to cadiz but the admiral hearing that an english fleet was cruising in those waters resolved to make for a french port the spanish commanders of the convoy objected to this decision they wanted to be taken to a spanish port and if not to cadiz into vigo bay situated on the northwest coast of spain and which was not blocked admiral chateaurenaud had the rashness to obey this injunction and the galleons entered vigo bay unfortunately it formed an open road which could not be defended in any way they must therefore hasten to unload the galleons before the arrival of the combined fleet and time would not have failed them had not a miserable question of rivalry suddenly arisen you are following the chain of events asked captain nemo perfectly said i not knowing the end proposed by this historical lesson i will continue this is what passed the merchants of cadiz had a privilege by which they had the right of receiving all merchandise coming from the west indies now to disembark these ingots at the port of vigo was depriving them of their rights they complained at madrid and obtained the consent of the weakminded philip that the convoy without discharging its cargo should remain sequestered in the roads of vigo until the enemy had disappeared but whilst coming to this decision on the nd of october the english vessels arrived in vigo bay when admiral chateaurenaud in spite of inferior forces fought bravely but seeing that the treasure must fall into the enemys hands he burnt and scuttled every galleon which went to the bottom with their immense riches captain nemo stopped i admit i could not see yet why this history should interest me well i asked well m aronnax replied captain nemo we are in that vigo bay and it rests with yourself whether you will penetrate its mysteries the captain rose telling me to follow him i had had time to recover i obeyed the saloon was dark but through the transparent glass the waves were sparkling i looked for half a mile around the _nautilus_ the waters seemed bathed in electric light the sandy bottom was clean and bright some of the ships crew in their divingdresses were clearing away halfrotten barrels and empty cases from the midst of the blackened wrecks from these cases and from these barrels escaped ingots of gold and silver cascades of piastres and jewels the sand was heaped up with them laden with their precious booty the men returned to the _nautilus_ disposed of their burden and went back to this inexhaustible fishery of gold and silver i understood now this was the scene of the battle of the nd of october here on this very spot the galleons laden for the spanish government had sunk here captain nemo came according to his wants to pack up those millions with which he burdened the _nautilus_ it was for him and him alone america had given up her precious metals he was heir direct without anyone to share in those treasures torn from the incas and from the conquered of ferdinand cortez did you know sir he asked smiling that the sea contained such riches i knew i answered that they value money held in suspension in these waters at two millions doubtless but to extract this money the expense would be greater than the profit here on the contrary i have but to pick up what man has lostand not only in vigo bay but in a thousand other ports where shipwrecks have happened and which are marked on my submarine map can you understand now the source of the millions i am worth i understand captain but allow me to tell you that in exploring vigo bay you have only been beforehand with a rival society and which a society which has received from the spanish government the privilege of seeking those buried galleons the shareholders are led on by the allurement of an enormous bounty for they value these rich shipwrecks at five hundred millions five hundred millions they were answered captain nemo but they are so no longer just so said i and a warning to those shareholders would be an act of charity but who knows if it would be well received what gamblers usually regret above all is less the loss of their money than of their foolish hopes after all i pity them less than the thousands of unfortunates to whom so much riches welldistributed would have been profitable whilst for them they will be for ever barren i had no sooner expressed this regret than i felt that it must have wounded captain nemo barren he exclaimed with animation do you think then sir that these riches are lost because i gather them is it for myself alone according to your idea that i take the trouble to collect these treasures who told you that i did not make a good use of it do you think i am ignorant that there are suffering beings and oppressed races on this earth miserable creatures to console victims to avenge do you not understand captain nemo stopped at these last words regretting perhaps that he had spoken so much but i had guessed that whatever the motive which had forced him to seek independence under the sea it had left him still a man that his heart still beat for the sufferings of humanity and that his immense charity was for oppressed races as well as individuals and i then understood for whom those millions were destined which were forwarded by captain nemo when the _nautilus_ was cruising in the waters of crete chapter ix a vanished continent the next morning the th of february i saw the canadian enter my room i expected this visit he looked very disappointed well sir said he well ned fortune was against us yesterday yes that captain must needs stop exactly at the hour we intended leaving his vessel yes ned he had business at his bankers his bankers or rather his bankinghouse by that i mean the ocean where his riches are safer than in the chests of the state i then related to the canadian the incidents of the preceding night hoping to bring him back to the idea of not abandoning the captain but my recital had no other result than an energetically expressed regret from ned that he had not been able to take a walk on the battlefield of vigo on his own account however said he all is not ended it is only a blow of the harpoon lost another time we must succeed and tonight if necessary in what direction is the _nautilus_ going i asked i do not know replied ned well at noon we shall see the point the canadian returned to conseil as soon as i was dressed i went into the saloon the compass was not reassuring the course of the _nautilus_ was ssw we were turning our backs on europe i waited with some impatience till the ships place was pricked on the chart at about halfpast eleven the reservoirs were emptied and our vessel rose to the surface of the ocean i rushed towards the platform ned land had preceded me no more land in sight nothing but an immense sea some sails on the horizon doubtless those going to san roque in search of favourable winds for doubling the cape of good hope the weather was cloudy a gale of wind was preparing ned raved and tried to pierce the cloudy horizon he still hoped that behind all that fog stretched the land he so longed for at noon the sun showed itself for an instant the second profited by this brightness to take its height then the sea becoming more billowy we descended and the panel closed an hour after upon consulting the chart i saw the position of the _nautilus_ was marked at long and lat at leagues from the nearest coast there was no means of flight and i leave you to imagine the rage of the canadian when i informed him of our situation for myself i was not particularly sorry i felt lightened of the load which had oppressed me and was able to return with some degree of calmness to my accustomed work that night about eleven oclock i received a most unexpected visit from captain nemo he asked me very graciously if i felt fatigued from my watch of the preceding night i answered in the negative then m aronnax i propose a curious excursion propose captain you have hitherto only visited the submarine depths by daylight under the brightness of the sun would it suit you to see them in the darkness of the night most willingly i warn you the way will be tiring we shall have far to walk and must climb a mountain the roads are not well kept what you say captain only heightens my curiosity i am ready to follow you come then sir we will put on our divingdresses arrived at the robingroom i saw that neither of my companions nor any of the ships crew were to follow us on this excursion captain nemo had not even proposed my taking with me either ned or conseil in a few moments we had put on our divingdresses they placed on our backs the reservoirs abundantly filled with air but no electric lamps were prepared i called the captains attention to the fact they will be useless he replied i thought i had not heard aright but i could not repeat my observation for the captains head had already disappeared in its metal case i finished harnessing myself i felt them put an ironpointed stick into my hand and some minutes later after going through the usual form we set foot on the bottom of the atlantic at a depth of fathoms midnight was near the waters were profoundly dark but captain nemo pointed out in the distance a reddish spot a sort of large light shining brilliantly about two miles from the _nautilus_ what this fire might be what could feed it why and how it lit up the liquid mass i could not say in any case it did light our way vaguely it is true but i soon accustomed myself to the peculiar darkness and i understood under such circumstances the uselessness of the ruhmkorff apparatus as we advanced i heard a kind of pattering above my head the noise redoubling sometimes producing a continual shower i soon understood the cause it was rain falling violently and crisping the surface of the waves instinctively the thought flashed across my mind that i should be wet through by the water in the midst of the water i could not help laughing at the odd idea but indeed in the thick divingdress the liquid element is no longer felt and one only seems to be in an atmosphere somewhat denser than the terrestrial atmosphere nothing more after half an hours walk the soil became stony medusae microscopic crustacea and pennatules lit it slightly with their phosphorescent gleam i caught a glimpse of pieces of stone covered with millions of zoophytes and masses of sea weed my feet often slipped upon this sticky carpet of sea weed and without my irontipped stick i should have fallen more than once in turning round i could still see the whitish lantern of the _nautilus_ beginning to pale in the distance but the rosy light which guided us increased and lit up the horizon the presence of this fire under water puzzled me in the highest degree was i going towards a natural phenomenon as yet unknown to the _savants_ of the earth or even for this thought crossed my brain had the hand of man aught to do with this conflagration had he fanned this flame was i to meet in these depths companions and friends of captain nemo whom he was going to visit and who like him led this strange existence should i find down there a whole colony of exiles who weary of the miseries of this earth had sought and found independence in the deep ocean all these foolish and unreasonable ideas pursued me and in this condition of mind overexcited by the succession of wonders continually passing before my eyes i should not have been surprised to meet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns of which captain nemo dreamed our road grew lighter and lighter the white glimmer came in rays from the summit of a mountain about feet high but what i saw was simply a reflection developed by the clearness of the waters the source of this inexplicable light was a fire on the opposite side of the mountain in the midst of this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the atlantic captain nemo advanced without hesitation he knew this dreary road doubtless he had often travelled over it and could not lose himself i followed him with unshaken confidence he seemed to me like a genie of the sea and as he walked before me i could not help admiring his stature which was outlined in black on the luminous horizon it was one in the morning when we arrived at the first slopes of the mountain but to gain access to them we must venture through the difficult paths of a vast copse yes a copse of dead trees without leaves without sap trees petrified by the action of the water and here and there overtopped by gigantic pines it was like a coalpit still standing holding by the roots to the broken soil and whose branches like fine black paper cuttings showed distinctly on the watery ceiling picture to yourself a forest in the hartz hanging on to the sides of the mountain but a forest swallowed up the paths were encumbered with seaweed and fucus between which grovelled a whole world of crustacea i went along climbing the rocks striding over extended trunks breaking the sea bindweed which hung from one tree to the other and frightening the fishes which flew from branch to branch pressing onward i felt no fatigue i followed my guide who was never tired what a spectacle how can i express it how paint the aspect of those woods and rocks in this mediumtheir under parts dark and wild the upper coloured with red tints by that light which the reflecting powers of the waters doubled we climbed rocks which fell directly after with gigantic bounds and the low growling of an avalanche to right and left ran long dark galleries where sight was lost here opened vast glades which the hand of man seemed to have worked and i sometimes asked myself if some inhabitant of these submarine regions would not suddenly appear to me but captain nemo was still mounting i could not stay behind i followed boldly my stick gave me good help a false step would have been dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the gulfs but i walked with firm step without feeling any giddiness now i jumped a crevice the depth of which would have made me hesitate had it been among the glaciers on the land now i ventured on the unsteady trunk of a tree thrown across from one abyss to the other without looking under my feet having only eyes to admire the wild sites of this region there monumental rocks leaning on their regularlycut bases seemed to defy all laws of equilibrium from between their stony knees trees sprang like a jet under heavy pressure and upheld others which upheld them natural towers large scarps cut perpendicularly like a curtain inclined at an angle which the laws of gravitation could never have tolerated in terrestrial regions two hours after quitting the _nautilus_ we had crossed the line of trees and a hundred feet above our heads rose the top of the mountain which cast a shadow on the brilliant irradiation of the opposite slope some petrified shrubs ran fantastically here and there fishes got up under our feet like birds in the long grass the massive rocks were rent with impenetrable fractures deep grottos and unfathomable holes at the bottom of which formidable creatures might be heard moving my blood curdled when i saw enormous antennae blocking my road or some frightful claw closing with a noise in the shadow of some cavity millions of luminous spots shone brightly in the midst of the darkness they were the eyes of giant crustacea crouched in their holes giant lobsters setting themselves up like halberdiers and moving their claws with the clicking sound of pincers titanic crabs pointed like a gun on its carriage and frightfullooking poulps interweaving their tentacles like a living nest of serpents we had now arrived on the first platform where other surprises awaited me before us lay some picturesque ruins which betrayed the hand of man and not that of the creator there were vast heaps of stone amongst which might be traced the vague and shadowy forms of castles and temples clothed with a world of blossoming zoophytes and over which instead of ivy seaweed and fucus threw a thick vegetable mantle but what was this portion of the globe which had been swallowed by cataclysms who had placed those rocks and stones like cromlechs of prehistoric times where was i whither had captain nemos fancy hurried me i would fain have asked him not being able to i stopped himi seized his arm but shaking his head and pointing to the highest point of the mountain he seemed to say come come along come higher i followed and in a few minutes i had climbed to the top which for a circle of ten yards commanded the whole mass of rock i looked down the side we had just climbed the mountain did not rise more than seven or eight hundred feet above the level of the plain but on the opposite side it commanded from twice that height the depths of this part of the atlantic my eyes ranged far over a large space lit by a violent fulguration in fact the mountain was a volcano at fifty feet above the peak in the midst of a rain of stones and scoriae a large crater was vomiting forth torrents of lava which fell in a cascade of fire into the bosom of the liquid mass thus situated this volcano lit the lower plain like an immense torch even to the extreme limits of the horizon i said that the submarine crater threw up lava but no flames flames require the oxygen of the air to feed upon and cannot be developed under water but streams of lava having in themselves the principles of their incandescence can attain a white heat fight vigorously against the liquid element and turn it to vapour by contact rapid currents bearing all these gases in diffusion and torrents of lava slid to the bottom of the mountain like an eruption of vesuvius on another terra del greco there indeed under my eyes ruined destroyed lay a townits roofs open to the sky its temples fallen its arches dislocated its columns lying on the ground from which one would still recognise the massive character of tuscan architecture further on some remains of a gigantic aqueduct here the high base of an acropolis with the floating outline of a parthenon there traces of a quay as if an ancient port had formerly abutted on the borders of the ocean and disappeared with its merchant vessels and its wargalleys farther on again long lines of sunken walls and broad deserted streetsa perfect pompeii escaped beneath the waters such was the sight that captain nemo brought before my eyes where was i where was i i must know at any cost i tried to speak but captain nemo stopped me by a gesture and picking up a piece of chalkstone advanced to a rock of black basalt and traced the one word atlantis what a light shot through my mind atlantis the atlantis of plato that continent denied by origen and humbolt who placed its disappearance amongst the legendary tales i had it there now before my eyes bearing upon it the unexceptionable testimony of its catastrophe the region thus engulfed was beyond europe asia and lybia beyond the columns of hercules where those powerful people the atlantides lived against whom the first wars of ancient greeks were waged thus led by the strangest destiny i was treading under foot the mountains of this continent touching with my hand those ruins a thousand generations old and contemporary with the geological epochs i was walking on the very spot where the contemporaries of the first man had walked whilst i was trying to fix in my mind every detail of this grand landscape captain nemo remained motionless as if petrified in mute ecstasy leaning on a mossy stone was he dreaming of those generations long since disappeared was he asking them the secret of human destiny was it here this strange man came to steep himself in historical recollections and live again this ancient lifehe who wanted no modern one what would i not have given to know his thoughts to share them to understand them we remained for an hour at this place contemplating the vast plains under the brightness of the lava which was some times wonderfully intense rapid tremblings ran along the mountain caused by internal bubblings deep noise distinctly transmitted through the liquid medium were echoed with majestic grandeur at this moment the moon appeared through the mass of waters and threw her pale rays on the buried continent it was but a gleam but what an indescribable effect the captain rose cast one last look on the immense plain and then bade me follow him we descended the mountain rapidly and the mineral forest once passed i saw the lantern of the _nautilus_ shining like a star the captain walked straight to it and we got on board as the first rays of light whitened the surface of the ocean chapter x the submarine coalmines the next day the th of february i awoke very late the fatigues of the previous night had prolonged my sleep until eleven oclock i dressed quickly and hastened to find the course the _nautilus_ was taking the instruments showed it to be still toward the south with a speed of twenty miles an hour and a depth of fifty fathoms the species of fishes here did not differ much from those already noticed there were rays of giant size five yards long and endowed with great muscular strength which enabled them to shoot above the waves sharks of many kinds amongst others one fifteen feet long with triangular sharp teeth and whose transparency rendered it almost invisible in the water amongst bony fish conseil noticed some about three yards long armed at the upper jaw with a piercing sword other brightcoloured creatures known in the time of aristotle by the name of the seadragon which are dangerous to capture on account of the spikes on their back about four oclock the soil generally composed of a thick mud mixed with petrified wood changed by degrees and it became more stony and seemed strewn with conglomerate and pieces of basalt with a sprinkling of lava i thought that a mountainous region was succeeding the long plains and accordingly after a few evolutions of the _nautilus_ i saw the southerly horizon blocked by a high wall which seemed to close all exit its summit evidently passed the level of the ocean it must be a continent or at least an islandone of the canaries or of the cape verde islands the bearings not being yet taken perhaps designedly i was ignorant of our exact position in any case such a wall seemed to me to mark the limits of that atlantis of which we had in reality passed over only the smallest part much longer should i have remained at the window admiring the beauties of sea and sky but the panels closed at this moment the _nautilus_ arrived at the side of this high perpendicular wall what it would do i could not guess i returned to my room it no longer moved i laid myself down with the full intention of waking after a few hours sleep but it was eight oclock the next day when i entered the saloon i looked at the manometer it told me that the _nautilus_ was floating on the surface of the ocean besides i heard steps on the platform i went to the panel it was open but instead of broad daylight as i expected i was surrounded by profound darkness where were we was i mistaken was it still night no not a star was shining and night has not that utter darkness illustration the _nautilus_ was floating near a mountain i knew not what to think when a voice near me said is that you professor ah captain i answered where are we underground sir underground i exclaimed and the _nautilus_ floating still it always floats but i do not understand wait a few minutes our lantern will be lit and if you like light places you will be satisfied i stood on the platform and waited the darkness was so complete that i could not even see captain nemo but looking to the zenith exactly above my head i seemed to catch an undecided gleam a kind of twilight filling a circular hole at this instant the lantern was lit and its vividness dispelled the faint light i closed my dazzled eyes for an instant and then looked again the _nautilus_ was stationary floating near a mountain which formed a sort of quay the lake then supporting it was a lake imprisoned by a circle of walls measuring two miles in diameter and six in circumference its level the manometer showed could only be the same as the outside level for there must necessarily be a communication between the lake and the sea the high partitions leaning forward on their base grew into a vaulted roof bearing the shape of an immense funnel turned upside down the height being about five or six hundred yards at the summit was a circular orifice by which i had caught the slight gleam of light evidently daylight where are we i asked in the very heart of an extinct volcano the interior of which has been invaded by the sea after some great convulsion of the earth whilst you were sleeping professor the _nautilus_ penetrated to this lagoon by a natural canal which opens about ten yards beneath the surface of the ocean this is its harbour of refuge a sure commodious and mysterious one sheltered from all gales show me if you can on the coasts of any of your continents or islands a road which can give such perfect refuge from all storms certainly i replied you are in safety here captain nemo who could reach you in the heart of a volcano but did i not see an opening at its summit yes its crater formerly filled with lava vapour and flames and which now gives entrance to the lifegiving air we breathe but what is this volcanic mountain it belongs to one of the numerous islands with which this sea is strewnto vessels a simple sandbankto us an immense cavern chance led me to discover it and chance served me well but of what use is this refuge captain the _nautilus_ wants no port no sir but it wants electricity to make it move and the wherewithal to make the electricitysodium to feed the elements coal from which to get the sodium and a coalmine to supply the coal and exactly on this spot the sea covers entire forests embedded during the geological periods now mineralised and transformed into coal for me they are an inexhaustible mine your men follow the trade of miners here then captain exactly so these mines extend under the waves like the mines of newcastle here in their divingdresses pick axe and shovel in hand my men extract the coal which i do not even ask from the mines of the earth when i burn this combustible for the manufacture of sodium the smoke escaping from the crater of the mountain gives it the appearance of a stillactive volcano and we shall see your companions at work no not this time at least for i am in a hurry to continue our submarine tour of the earth so i shall content myself with drawing from the reserve of sodium i already possess the time for loading is one day only and we continue our voyage so if you wish to go over the cavern and make the round of the lagoon you must take advantage of today m aronnax i thanked the captain and went to look for my companions who had not yet left their cabin i invited them to follow me without saying where we were they mounted the platform conseil who was astonished at nothing seemed to look upon it as quite natural that he should wake under a mountain after having fallen asleep under the waves but ned land thought of nothing but finding whether the cavern had any exit after breakfast about ten oclock we went down on to the mountain here we are once more on land said conseil i do not call this land said the canadian and besides we are not on it but beneath it between the walls of the mountains and the waters of the lake lay a sandy shore which at its greatest breadth measured five hundred feet on this soil one might easily make the tour of the lake but the base of the high partitions was stony ground with volcanic blocks and enormous pumicestones lying in picturesque heaps all these detached masses covered with enamel polished by the action of the subterraneous fires shone resplendent by the light of our electric lantern the mica dust from the shore rising under our feet flew like a cloud of sparks the bottom now rose sensibly and we soon arrived at long circuitous slopes or inclined planes which took us higher by degrees but we were obliged to walk carefully among these conglomerates bound by no cement the feet slipping on the glassy crystal felspar and quartz the volcanic nature of this enormous excavation was confirmed on all sides and i pointed it out to my companions picture to yourselves said i what this crater must have been when filled with boiling lava and when the level of the incandescent liquid rose to the orifice of the mountain as though melted on the top of a hot plate i can picture it perfectly said conseil but sir will you tell me why the great architect has suspended operations and how it is that the furnace is replaced by the quiet waters of the lake most probably conseil because some convulsion beneath the ocean produced that very opening which has served as a passage for the _nautilus_ then the waters of the atlantic rushed into the interior of the mountain there must have been a terrible struggle between the two elements a struggle which ended in the victory of neptune but many ages have run out since then and the submerged volcano is now a peaceable grotto very well replied ned land i accept the explanation sir but in our own interests i regret that the opening of which you speak was not made above the level of the sea but friend ned said conseil if the passage had not been under the sea the _nautilus_ could not have gone through it we continued ascending the steps became more and more perpendicular and narrow deep excavations which we were obliged to cross cut them here and there sloping masses had to be turned we slid upon our knees and crawled along but conseils dexterity and the canadians strength surmounted all obstacles at a height of about feet the nature of the ground changed without becoming more practicable to the conglomerate and trachyte succeeded black basalt the first dispread in layers full of bubbles the latter forming regular prisms placed like a colonnade supporting the spring of the immense vault an admirable specimen of natural architecture between the blocks of basalt wound long streams of lava long since grown cold encrusted with bituminous rays and in some places there were spread large carpets of sulphur a more powerful light shone through the upper crater shedding a vague glimmer over these volcanic depressions for ever buried in the bosom of this extinguished mountain but our upward march was soon stopped at a height of about two hundred and fifty feet by impassable obstacles there was a complete vaulted arch overhanging us and our ascent was changed to a circular walk at the last change vegetable life began to struggle with the mineral some shrubs and even some trees grew from the fractures of the walls i recognised some euphorbias with the caustic sugar coming from them heliotropes quite incapable of justifying their name sadly drooped their clusters of flowers both their colour and perfume half gone here and there some chrysanthemums grew timidly at the foot of an aloe with long sicklylooking leaves but between the streams of lava i saw some little violets still slightly perfumed and i admit that i smelt them with delight perfume is the soul of the flower and seaflowers have no soul we had arrived at the foot of some sturdy dragontrees which had pushed aside the rocks with their strong roots when ned land exclaimed ah sir a hive a hive a hive i replied with a gesture of incredulity yes a hive repeated the canadian and bees humming round it i approached and was bound to believe my own eyes there at a hole bored in one of the dragontrees were some thousands of these ingenious insects so common in all the canaries and whose produce is so much esteemed naturally enough the canadian wished to gather the honey and i could not well oppose his wish a quantity of dry leaves mixed with sulphur he lit with a spark from his flint and he began to smoke out the bees the humming ceased by degrees and the hive eventually yielded several pounds of the sweetest honey with which ned land filled his haversack when i have mixed this honey with the paste of the artocarpus said he i shall be able to offer you a succulent cake pon my word said conseil it will be gingerbread never mind the gingerbread said i let us continue our interesting walk at every turn of the path we were following the lake appeared in all its length and breadth the lantern lit up the whole of its peaceable surface which knew neither ripple nor wave the _nautilus_ remained perfectly immovable on the platform and on the mountain the ships crew were working like black shadows clearly carved against the luminous atmosphere we were now going round the highest crest of the first layers of rock which upheld the roof i then saw that bees were not the only representatives of the animal kingdom in the interior of this volcano birds of prey hovered here and there in the shadows or fled from their nests on the top of the rocks there were sparrow hawks with white breasts and kestrels and down the slopes scampered with their long legs several fine fat bustards i leave anyone to imagine the covetousness of the canadian at the sight of this savoury game and whether he did not regret having no gun but he did his best to replace the lead by stones and after several fruitless attempts he succeeded in wounding a magnificent bird to say that he risked his life twenty times before reaching it is but the truth but he managed so well that the creature joined the honeycakes in his bag we were now obliged to descend toward the shore the crest becoming impracticable above us the crater seemed to gape like the mouth of a well from this place the sky could be clearly seen and clouds dissipated by the west wind leaving behind them even on the summit of the mountain their misty remnantscertain proof that they were only moderately high for the volcano did not rise more than eight hundred feet above the level of the ocean half an hour after the canadians last exploit we had regained the inner shore here the flora was represented by large carpets of marine crystal a little umbelliferous plant very good to pickle which also bears the name of piercestone and seafennel conseil gathered some bundles of it as to the fauna it might be counted by thousands of crustacea of all sorts lobsters crabs spidercrabs chameleon shrimps and a large number of shells rockfish and limpets threequarters of an hour later we had finished our circuitous walk and were on board the crew had just finished loading the sodium and the _nautilus_ could have left that instant but captain nemo gave no order did he wish to wait until night and leave the submarine passage secretly perhaps so whatever it might be the next day the _nautilus_ having left its port steered clear of all land at a few yards beneath the waves of the atlantic chapter xi the sargasso sea that day the _nautilus_ crossed a singular part of the atlantic ocean no one can be ignorant of the existence of a current of warm water known by the name of the gulf stream after leaving the gulf of florida we went in the direction of spitzbergen but before entering the gulf of mexico about of n lat this current divides into two arms the principal one going towards the coast of ireland and norway whilst the second bends to the south about the height of the azores then touching the african shore and describing a lengthened oval returns to the antilles this second armit is rather a collar than an armsurrounds with its circles of warm water that portion of the cold quiet immovable ocean called the sargasso sea a perfect lake in the open atlantic it takes no less than three years for the great current to pass round it such was the region the _nautilus_ was now visiting a perfect meadow a close carpet of seaweed fucus and tropical berries so thick and so compact that the stem of a vessel could hardly tear its way through it and captain nemo not wishing to entangle his screw in this herbaceous mass kept some yards beneath the surface of the waves the name sargasso comes from the spanish word sargazzo which signifies kelp this kelp or berryplant is the principal formation of this immense bank and this is the reason why these plants unite in the peaceful basin of the atlantic the only explanation which can be given he says seems to me to result from the experience known to all the world place in a vase some fragments of cork or other floating body and give to the water in the vase a circular movement the scattered fragments will unite in a group in the centre of the liquid surface that is to say in the part least agitated in the phenomenon we are considering the atlantic is the vase the gulf stream the circular current and the sargasso sea the central point at which the floating bodies unite i share maurys opinion and i was able to study the phenomenon in the very midst where vessels rarely penetrate above us floated products of all kinds heaped up among these brownish plants trunks of trees torn from the andes or the rocky mountains and floated by the amazon or the mississippi numerous wrecks remains of keels or ships bottoms sideplanks stove in and so weighted with shells and barnacles that they could not again rise to the surface and time will one day justify maurys other opinion that these substances thus accumulated for ages will become petrified by the action of the water and will then form inexhaustible coalminesa precious reserve prepared by farseeing nature for the moment when men shall have exhausted the mines of continents in the midst of this inextricable mass of plants and sea weed i noticed some charming pink halcyons and actiniae with their long tentacles trailing after them and medusæ green red and blue all the day of the nd of february we passed in the sargasso sea where such fish as are partial to marine plants find abundant nourishment the next the ocean had returned to its accustomed aspect from this time for nineteen days from the rd of february to the th of march the _nautilus_ kept in the middle of the atlantic carrying us at a constant speed of a hundred leagues in twentyfour hours captain nemo evidently intended accomplishing his submarine programme and i imagined that he intended after doubling cape horn to return to the australian seas of the pacific ned land had cause for fear in these large seas void of islands we could not attempt to leave the boat nor had we any means of opposing captain nemos will our only course was to submit but what we could neither gain by force nor cunning i liked to think might be obtained by persuasion this voyage ended would he not consent to restore our liberty under an oath never to reveal his existencean oath of honour which we should have religiously kept but we must consider that delicate question with the captain but was i free to claim this liberty had he not himself said from the beginning in the firmest manner that the secret of his life exacted from him our lasting imprisonment on board the _nautilus_ and would not my four months silence appear to him a tacit acceptance of our situation and would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our projects if at some future time a favourable opportunity offered to return to them during the nineteen days mentioned above no incident of any kind happened to signalise our voyage i saw little of the captain he was at work in the library i often found his books left open especially those on natural history my work on submarine depths conned over by him was covered with marginal notes often contradicting my theories and systems but the captain contented himself with thus purging my work it was very rare for him to discuss it with me sometimes i heard the melancholy tones of his organ but only at night in the midst of the deepest obscurity when the _nautilus_ slept upon the deserted ocean during this part of our voyage we sailed whole days on the surface of the waves the sea seemed abandoned a few sailingvessels on the road to india were making for the cape of good hope one day we were followed by the boats of a whaler who no doubt took us for some enormous whale of great price but captain nemo did not wish the worthy fellows to lose their time and trouble so ended the chase by plunging under the water our navigation continued until the th of march that day the _nautilus_ was employed in taking soundings which greatly interested me we had then made about leagues since our departure from the high seas of the pacific the bearings gave us s lat and w long it was the same water in which captain denham of the herald sounded fathoms without finding the bottom there too lieutenant parker of the american frigate congress could not touch the bottom with fathoms captain nemo intended seeking the bottom of the ocean by a diagonal sufficiently lengthened by means of lateral planes placed at an angle of with the waterline of the _nautilus_ then the screw set to work at its maximum speed its four blades beating the waves with in describable force under this powerful pressure the hull of the _nautilus_ quivered like a sonorous chord and sank regularly under the water at fathoms i saw some blackish tops rising from the midst of the waters but these summits might belong to high mountains like the himalayas or mont blanc even higher and the depth of the abyss remained incalculable the _nautilus_ descended still lower in spite of the great pressure i felt the steel plates tremble at the fastenings of the bolts its bars bent its partitions groaned the windows of the saloon seemed to curve under the pressure of the waters and this firm structure would doubtless have yielded if as its captain had said it had not been capable of resistance like a solid block we had attained a depth of yards four leagues and the sides of the _nautilus_ then bore a pressure of atmospheres that is to say lbs to each square twofifths of an inch of its surface what a situation to be in i exclaimed to overrun these deep regions where man has never trod look captain look at these magnificent rocks these uninhabited grottoes these lowest receptacles of the globe where life is no longer possible what unknown sights are here why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them would you like to carry away more than the remembrance said captain nemo what do you mean by those words i mean to say that nothing is easier than to make a photographic view of this submarine region i had not time to express my surprise at this new proposition when at captain nemos call an objective was brought into the saloon through the widelyopened panel the liquid mass was bright with electricity which was distributed with such uniformity that not a shadow not a gradation was to be seen in our manufactured light the _nautilus_ remained motionless the force of its screw subdued by the inclination of its planes the instrument was propped on the bottom of the oceanic site and in a few seconds we had obtained a perfect negative but the operation being over captain nemo said let us go up we must not abuse our position nor expose the _nautilus_ too long to such great pressure go up again i exclaimed hold well on i had not time to understand why the captain cautioned me thus when i was thrown forward on to the carpet at a signal from the captain its screw was shipped and its blades raised vertically the _nautilus_ shot into the air like a balloon rising with stunning rapidity and cutting the mass of waters with a sonorous agitation nothing was visible and in four minutes it had shot through the four leagues which separated it from the ocean and after emerging like a flyingfish fell making the waves rebound to an enormous height chapter xii cachalots and whales during the nights of the th and th of march the _nautilus_ returned to its southerly course i fancied that when on a level with cape horn he would turn the helm westward in order to beat the pacific seas and so complete the tour of the world he did nothing of the kind but continued on his way to the southern regions where was he going to to the pole it was madness i began to think that the captains temerity justified ned lands fears for some time past the canadian had not spoken to me of his projects of flight he was less communicative almost silent i could see that this lengthened imprisonment was weighing upon him and i felt that rage was burning within him when he met the captain his eyes lit up with suppressed anger and i feared that his natural violence would lead him into some extreme that day the th of march conseil and he came to me in my room i inquired the cause of their visit a simple question to ask you sir replied the canadian speak ned how many men are there on board the _nautilus_ do you think i cannot tell my friend i should say that its working does not require a large crew certainly under existing conditions ten men at the most ought to be enough well why should there be any more why i replied looking fixedly at ned land whose meaning was easy to guess because i added if my surmises are correct and if i have well understood the captains existence the _nautilus_ is not only a vessel it is also a place of refuge for those who like its commander have broken every tie upon earth perhaps so said conseil but in any case the _nautilus_ can only contain a certain number of men could not you sir estimate their maximum how conseil by calculation given the size of the vessel which you know sir and consequently the quantity of air it contains knowing also how much each man expends at a breath and comparing these results with the fact that the _nautilus_ is obliged to go to the surface every twentyfour hours conseil had not finished the sentence before i saw what he was driving at i understand said i but that calculation though simple enough can give but a very uncertain result never mind said ned land urgently here it is then said i in one hour each man consumes the oxygen contained in twenty gallons of air and in twentyfour that contained in gallons we must therefore find how many times gallons of air the _nautilus_ contains just so said conseil or i continued the size of the _nautilus_ being tons and one ton holding gallons it contains gallons of air which divided by gives a quotient of which means to say strictly speaking that the air contained in the _nautilus_ would suffice for men for twentyfour hours six hundred and twentyfive repeated ned but remember that all of us passengers sailors and officers included would not form a tenth part of that number still too many for three men murmured conseil the canadian shook his head passed his hand across his forehead and left the room without answering will you allow me to make one observation sir said conseil poor ned is longing for everything that he can not have his past life is always present to him everything that we are forbidden he regrets his head is full of old recollections and we must understand him what has he to do here nothing he is not learned like you sir and has not the same taste for the beauties of the sea that we have he would risk everything to be able to go once more into a tavern in his own country certainly the monotony on board must seem intolerable to the canadian accustomed as he was to a life of liberty and activity events were rare which could rouse him to any show of spirit but that day an event did happen which recalled the bright days of the harpooner about eleven in the morning being on the surface of the ocean the _nautilus_ fell in with a troop of whalesan encounter which did not astonish me knowing that these creatures hunted to death had taken refuge in high latitudes we were seated on the platform with a quiet sea the month of october in those latitudes gave us some lovely autumnal days it was the canadianhe could not be mistakenwho signalled a whale on the eastern horizon looking attentively one might see its black back rise and fall with the waves five miles from the _nautilus_ ah exclaimed ned land if i was on board a whaler now such a meeting would give me pleasure it is one of large size see with what strength its blowholes throw up columns of air an steam confound it why am i bound to these steel plates what ned said i you have not forgotten your old ideas of fishing can a whalefisher ever forget his old trade sir can he ever tire of the emotions caused by such a chase you have never fished in these seas ned never sir in the northern only and as much in behring as in davis straits then the southern whale is still unknown to you it is the greenland whale you have hunted up to this time and that would not risk passing through the warm waters of the equator whales are localised according to their kinds in certain seas which they never leave and if one of these creatures went from behring to davis straits it must be simply because there is a passage from one sea to the other either on the american or the asiatic side in that case as i have never fished in these seas i do not know the kind of whale frequenting them i have told you ned a greater reason for making their acquaintance said conseil look look exclaimed the canadian they approach they aggravate me they know that i cannot get at them ned stamped his feet his hand trembled as he grasped an imaginary harpoon are these cetaceans as large as those of the northern seas asked he very nearly ned because i have seen large whales sir whales measuring a hundred feet i have even been told that those of hullamoch and umgallick of the aleutian islands are sometimes a hundred and fifty feet long that seems to me exaggeration these creatures are only balaeaopterons provided with dorsal fins and like the cachalots are generally much smaller than the greenland whale ah exclaimed the canadian whose eyes had never left the ocean they are coming nearer they are in the same water as the _nautilus_ then returning to the conversation he said you spoke of the cachalot as a small creature i have heard of gigantic ones they are intelligent cetacea it is said of some that they cover themselves with seaweed and fucus and then are taken for islands people encamp upon them and settle there lights a fire and build houses said conseil yes joker said ned land and one fine day the creature plunges carrying with it all the inhabitants to the bottom of the sea something like the travels of sinbad the sailor i replied laughing ah suddenly exclaimed ned land it is not one whale there are tenthere are twentyit is a whole troop and i not able to do anything hands and feet tied but friend ned said conseil why do you not ask captain nemos permission to chase them conseil had not finished his sentence when ned land had lowered himself through the panel to seek the captain a few minutes afterwards the two appeared together on the platform captain nemo watched the troop of cetacea playing on the waters about a mile from the _nautilus_ they are southern whales said he there goes the fortune of a whole fleet of whalers well sir asked the canadian can i not chase them if only to remind me of my old trade of harpooner and to what purpose replied captain nemo only to destroy we have nothing to do with the whaleoil on board but sir continued the canadian in the red sea you allowed us to follow the dugong then it was to procure fresh meat for my crew here it would be killing for killings sake i know that is a privilege reserved for man but i do not approve of such murderous pastime in destroying the southern whale like the greenland whale an inoffensive creature your traders do a culpable action master land they have already depopulated the whole of baffins bay and are annihilating a class of useful animals leave the unfortunate cetacea alone they have plenty of natural enemiescachalots swordfish and sawfishwithout you troubling them the captain was right the barbarous and inconsiderate greed of these fishermen will one day cause the disappearance of the last whale in the ocean ned land whistled yankeedoodle between his teeth thrust his hands into his pockets and turned his back upon us but captain nemo watched the troop of cetacea and addressing me said i was right in saying that whales had natural enemies enough without counting man these will have plenty to do before long do you see m aronnax about eight miles to leeward those blackish moving points yes captain i replied those are cachalotsterrible animals which i have met in troops of two or three hundred as to those they are cruel mischievous creatures they would be right in exterminating them the canadian turned quickly at the last words well captain said he it is still time in the interest of the whales it is useless to expose ones self professor the _nautilus_ will disperse them it is armed with a steel spur as good as master lands harpoon i imagine the canadian did not put himself out enough to shrug his shoulders attack cetacea with blows of a spur who had ever heard of such a thing wait m aronnax said captain nemo we will show you something you have never yet seen we have no pity for these ferocious creatures they are nothing but mouth and teeth mouth and teeth no one could better describe the macrocephalous cachalot which is sometimes more than seventyfive feet long its enormous head occupies onethird of its entire body better armed than the whale whose upper jaw is furnished only with whalebone it is supplied with twentyfive large tusks about eight inches long cylindrical and conical at the top each weighing two pounds it is in the upper part of this enormous head in great cavities divided by cartilages that is to be found from six to eight hundred pounds of that precious oil called spermaceti the cachalot is a disagreeable creature more tadpole than fish according to fredols description it is badly formed the whole of its left side being if we may say it a failure and being only able to see with its right eye but the formidable troop was nearing us they had seen the whales and were preparing to attack them one could judge beforehand that the cachalots would be victorious not only because they were better built for attack than their inoffensive adversaries but also because they could remain longer under water without coming to the surface there was only just time to go to the help of the whales the _nautilus_ went under water conseil ned land and i took our places before the window in the saloon and captain nemo joined the pilot in his cage to work his apparatus as an engine of destruction soon i felt the beatings of the screw quicken and our speed increased the battle between the cachalots and the whales had already begun when the _nautilus_ arrived they did not at first show any fear at the sight of this new monster joining in the conflict but they soon had to guard against its blows what a battle the _nautilus_ was nothing but a formidable harpoon brandished by the hand of its captain it hurled itself against the fleshy mass passing through from one part to the other leaving behind it two quivering halves of the animal it could not feel the formidable blows from their tails upon its sides nor the shock which it produced itself much more one cachalot killed it ran at the next tacked on the spot that it might not miss its prey going forwards and backwards answering to its helm plunging when the cetacean dived into the deep waters coming up with it when it returned to the surface striking it front or sideways cutting or tearing in all directions and at any pace piercing it with its terrible spur what carnage what a noise on the surface of the waves what sharp hissing and what snorting peculiar to these enraged animals in the midst of these waters generally so peaceful their tails made perfect billows for one hour this wholesale massacre continued from which the cachalots could not escape several times ten or twelve united tried to crush the _nautilus_ by their weight from the window we could see their enormous mouths studded with tusks and their formidable eyes ned land could not contain himself he threatened and swore at them we could feel them clinging to our vessel like dogs worrying a wild boar in a copse but the _nautilus_ working its screw carried them here and there or to the upper levels of the ocean without caring for their enormous weight nor the powerful strain on the vessel at length the mass of cachalots broke up the waves became quiet and i felt that we were rising to the surface the panel opened and we hurried on to the platform the sea was covered with mutilated bodies a formidable explosion could not have divided and torn this fleshy mass with more violence we were floating amid gigantic bodies bluish on the back and white underneath covered with enormous protuberances some terrified cachalots were flying towards the horizon the waves were dyed red for several miles and the _nautilus_ floated in a sea of blood captain nemo joined us well master land said he well sir replied the canadian whose enthusiasm had somewhat calmed it is a terrible spectacle certainly but i am not a butcher i am a hunter and i call this a butchery it is a massacre of mischievous creatures replied the captain and the _nautilus_ is not a butchers knife i like my harpoon better said the canadian every one to his own answered the captain looking fixedly at ned land i feared he would commit some act of violence which would end in sad consequences but his anger was turned by the sight of a whale which the _nautilus_ had just come up with the creature had not quite escaped from the cachalots teeth i recognised the southern whale by its flat head which is entirely black anatomically it is distinguished from the white whale and the north cape whale by the seven cervical vertebrae and it has two more ribs than its congeners the unfortunate cetacean was lying on its side riddled with holes from the bites and quite dead from its mutilated fin still hung a young whale which it could not save from the massacre its open mouth let the water flow in and out murmuring like the waves breaking on the shore captain nemo steered close to the corpse of the creature two of his men mounted its side and i saw not without surprise that they were drawing from its breasts all the milk which they contained that is to say about two or three tons the captain offered me a cup of the milk which was still warm i could not help showing my repugnance to the drink but he assured me that it was excellent and not to be distinguished from cows milk i tasted it and was of his opinion it was a useful reserve to us for in the shape of salt butter or cheese it would form an agreeable variety from our ordinary food from that day i noticed with uneasiness that ned lands illwill towards captain nemo increased and i resolved to watch the canadians gestures closely chapter xiii the iceberg the _nautilus_ was steadily pursuing its southerly course following the fiftieth meridian with considerable speed did he wish to reach the pole i did not think so for every attempt to reach that point had hitherto failed again the season was far advanced for in the antarctic regions the th of march corresponds with the th of september of northern regions which begin at the equinoctial season on the th of march i saw floating ice in latitude merely pale bits of debris from twenty to twentyfive feet long forming banks over which the sea curled the _nautilus_ remained on the surface of the ocean ned land who had fished in the arctic seas was familiar with its icebergs but conseil and i admired them for the first time in the atmosphere towards the southern horizon stretched a white dazzling band english whalers have given it the name of ice blink however thick the clouds may be it is always visible and announces the presence of an ice pack or bank accordingly larger blocks soon appeared whose brilliancy changed with the caprices of the fog some of these masses showed green veins as if long undulating lines had been traced with sulphate of copper others resembled enormous amethysts with the light shining through them some reflected the light of day upon a thousand crystal facets others shaded with vivid calcareous reflections resembled a perfect town of marble the more we neared the south the more these floating islands increased both in number and importance at lat every pass had disappeared but seeking carefully captain nemo soon found a narrow opening through which he boldly slipped knowing however that it would close behind him thus guided by this clever hand the _nautilus_ passed through all the ice with a precision which quite charmed conseil icebergs or mountains icefields or smooth plains seeming to have no limits driftice or floating icepacks plains broken up called palchs when they are circular and streams when they are made up of long strips the temperature was very low the thermometer exposed to the air marked deg or below zero but we were warmly clad with fur at the expense of the seabear and seal the interior of the _nautilus_ warmed regularly by its electric apparatus defied the most intense cold besides it would only have been necessary to go some yards beneath the waves to find a more bearable temperature two months earlier we should have had perpetual daylight in these latitudes but already we had had three or four hours of night and by and by there would be six months of darkness in these circumpolar regions on the th of march we were in the latitude of new shetland and south orkney the captain told me that formerly numerous tribes of seals inhabited them but that english and american whalers in their rage for destruction massacred both old and young thus where there was once life and animation they had left silence and death about eight oclock on the morning of the th of march the _nautilus_ following the fiftyfifth meridian cut the antarctic polar circle ice surrounded us on all sides and closed the horizon but captain nemo went from one opening to another still going higher i cannot express my astonishment at the beauties of these new regions the ice took most surprising forms here the grouping formed an oriental town with innumerable mosques and minarets there a fallen city thrown to the earth as it were by some convulsion of nature the whole aspect was constantly changed by the oblique rays of the sun or lost in the greyish fog amidst hurricanes of snow detonations and falls were heard on all sides great overthrows of icebergs which altered the whole landscape like a diorama often seeing no exit i thought we were definitely prisoners but instinct guiding him at the slightest indication captain nemo would discover a new pass he was never mistaken when he saw the thin threads of bluish water trickling along the icefields and i had no doubt that he had already ventured into the midst of these antarctic seas before on the th of march however the icefields absolutely blocked our road it was not the iceberg itself as yet but vast fields cemented by the cold but this obstacle could not stop captain nemo he hurled himself against it with frightful violence the _nautilus_ entered the brittle mass like a wedge and split it with frightful crackings it was the battering ram of the ancients hurled by infinite strength the ice thrown high in the air fell like hail around us by its own power of impulsion our apparatus made a canal for itself some times carried away by its own impetus it lodged on the icefield crushing it with its weight and sometimes buried beneath it dividing it by a simple pitching movement producing large rents in it violent gales assailed us at this time accompanied by thick fogs through which from one end of the platform to the other we could see nothing the wind blew sharply from all parts of the compass and the snow lay in such hard heaps that we had to break it with blows of a pickaxe the temperature was always at deg below zero every outward part of the _nautilus_ was covered with ice a rigged vessel would have been entangled in the blocked up gorges a vessel without sails with electricity for its motive power and wanting no coal could alone brave such high latitudes at length on the th of march after many useless assaults the _nautilus_ was positively blocked it was no longer either streams packs or icefields but an interminable and immovable barrier formed by mountains soldered together an iceberg said the canadian to me i knew that to ned land as well as to all other navigators who had preceded us this was an inevitable obstacle the sun appearing for an instant at noon captain nemo took an observation as near as possible which gave our situation at long and of s lat we had advanced one degree more in this antarctic region of the liquid surface of the sea there was no longer a glimpse under the spur of the _nautilus_ lay stretched a vast plain entangled with confused blocks here and there sharp points and slender needles rising to a height of feet further on a steep shore hewn as it were with an axe and clothed with greyish tints huge mirrors reflecting a few rays of sunshine half drowned in the fog and over this desolate face of nature a stern silence reigned scarcely broken by the flapping of the wings of petrels and puffins everything was frozeneven the noise the _nautilus_ was then obliged to stop in its adventurous course amid these fields of ice in spite of our efforts in spite of the powerful means employed to break up the ice the _nautilus_ remained immovable generally when we can proceed no further we have return still open to us but here return was as impossible as advance for every pass had closed behind us and for the few moments when we were stationary we were likely to be entirely blocked which did indeed happen about two oclock in the afternoon the fresh ice forming around its sides with astonishing rapidity i was obliged to admit that captain nemo was more than imprudent i was on the platform at that moment the captain had been observing our situation for some time past when he said to me well sir what do you think of this i think that we are caught captain illustration the _nautilus_ was blocked up so m aronnax you really think that the _nautilus_ cannot disengage itself with difficulty captain for the season is already too far advanced for you to reckon on the breaking of the ice ah sir said captain nemo in an ironical tone you will always be the same you see nothing but difficulties and obstacles i affirm that not only can the _nautilus_ disengage itself but also that it can go further still further to the south i asked looking at the captain yes sir it shall go to the pole to the pole i exclaimed unable to repress a gesture of incredulity yes replied the captain coldly to the antarctic poleto that unknown point from whence springs every meridian of the globe you know whether i can do as i please with the _nautilus_ yes i knew that i knew that this man was bold even to rashness but to conquer those obstacles which bristled round the south pole rendering it more inaccessible than the north which had not yet been reached by the boldest navigatorswas it not a mad enterprise one which only a maniac would have conceived it then came into my head to ask captain nemo if he had ever discovered that pole which had never yet been trodden by a human creature no sir he replied but we will discover it together where others have failed i will not fail i have never yet led my _nautilus_ so far into southern seas but i repeat it shall go further yet i can well believe you captain said i in a slightly ironical tone i believe you let us go ahead there are no obstacles for us let us smash this iceberg let us blow it up and if it resists let us give the _nautilus_ wings to fly over it over it sir said captain nemo quietly no not over it but under it under it i exclaimed a sudden idea of the captains projects flashing upon my mind i understood the wonderful qualities of the _nautilus_ were going to serve us in this superhuman enterprise i see we are beginning to understand one another sir said the captain half smiling you begin to see the possibilityi should say the successof this attempt that which is impossible for an ordinary vessel is easy to the _nautilus_ if a continent lies before the pole it must stop before the continent but if on the contrary the pole is washed by open sea it will go even to the pole certainly said i carried away by the captains reasoning if the surface of the sea is solidified by the ice the lower depths are free by the providential law which has placed the maximum of density of the waters of the ocean one degree higher than freezingpoint and if i am not mistaken the portion of this iceberg which is above the water is as one to four to that which is below very nearly sir for one foot of iceberg above the sea there are three below it if these ice mountains are not more than feet above the surface they are not more than beneath and what are feet to the _nautilus_ nothing sir it could even seek at greater depths that uniform temperature of seawater and there brave with impunity the thirty or forty degrees of surface cold just so sirjust so i replied getting animated the only difficulty continued captain nemo is that of remaining several days without renewing our provision of air is that all the _nautilus_ has vast reservoirs we can fill them and they will supply us with all the oxygen we want well thought of m aronnax replied the captain smiling but not wishing you to accuse me of rashness i will first give you all my objections have you any more to make only one it is possible if the sea exists at the south pole that it may be covered and consequently we shall be unable to come to the surface good sir but do you forget that the _nautilus_ is armed with a powerful spur and could we not send it diagonally against these fields of ice which would open at the shocks ah sir you are full of ideas today besides captain i added enthusiastically why should we not find the sea open at the south pole as well as at the north the frozen poles of the earth do not coincide either in the southern or in the northern regions and until it is proved to the contrary we may suppose either a continent or an ocean free from ice at these two points of the globe i think so too m aronnax replied captain nemo i only wish you to observe that after having made so many objections to my project you are now crushing me with arguments in its favour the preparations for this audacious attempt now began the powerful pumps of the _nautilus_ were working air into the reservoirs and storing it at high pressure about four oclock captain nemo announced the closing of the panels on the platform i threw one last look at the massive iceberg which we were going to cross the weather was clear the atmosphere pure enough the cold very great being below zero but the wind having gone down this temperature was not so unbearable about ten men mounted the sides of the _nautilus_ armed with pickaxes to break the ice around the vessel which was soon free the operation was quickly performed for the fresh ice was still very thin we all went below the usual reservoirs were filled with the newlyliberated water and the _nautilus_ soon descended i had taken my place with conseil in the saloon through the open window we could see the lower beds of the southern ocean the thermometer went up the needle of the compass deviated on the dial at about feet as captain nemo had foreseen we were floating beneath the undulating bottom of the iceberg but the _nautilus_ went lower stillit went to the depth of four hundred fathoms the temperature of the water at the surface showed twelve degrees it was now only ten we had gained two i need not say the temperature of the _nautilus_ was raised by its heating apparatus to a much higher degree every manœuvre was accomplished with wonderful precision we shall pass it if you please sir said conseil i believe we shall i said in a tone of firm conviction in this open sea the _nautilus_ had taken its course direct to the pole without leaving the fiftysecond meridian from to deg twentytwo degrees and a half of latitude remained to travel that is about five hundred leagues the _nautilus_ kept up a mean speed of twentysix miles an hourthe speed of an express train if that was kept up in forty hours we should reach the pole for a part of the night the novelty of the situation kept us at the window the sea was lit with the electric lantern but it was deserted fishes did not sojourn in these imprisoned waters they only found there a passage to take them from the antarctic ocean to the open polar sea our pace was rapid we could feel it by the quivering of the long steel body about two in the morning i took some hours repose and conseil did the same in crossing the waist i did not meet captain nemo i supposed him to be in the pilots cage the next morning the th of march i took my post once more in the saloon the electric log told me that the speed of the _nautilus_ had been slackened it was then going towards the surface but prudently emptying its reservoirs very slowly my heart beat fast were we going to emerge and regain the open polar atmosphere no a shock told me that the _nautilus_ had struck the bottom of the iceberg still very thick judging from the deadened sound we had in deed struck to use a sea expression but in an inverse sense and at a thousand feet deep this would give three thousand feet of ice above us one thousand being above the watermark the iceberg was then higher than at its bordersnot a very reassuring fact several times that day the _nautilus_ tried again and every time it struck the wall which lay like a ceiling above it sometimes it met with but yards only of which rose above the surface it was twice the height it was when the _nautilus_ had gone under the waves i carefully noted the different depths and thus obtained a submarine profile of the chain as it was developed under the water that night no change had taken place in our situation still ice between four and five hundred yards in depth it was evidently diminishing but still what a thickness between us and the surface of the ocean it was then eight according to the daily custom on board the _nautilus_ its air should have been renewed four hours ago but i did not suffer much although captain nemo had not yet made any demand upon his reserve of oxygen my sleep was painful that night hope and fear besieged me by turns i rose several times the groping of the _nautilus_ continued about three in the morning i noticed that the lower surface of the iceberg was only about fifty feet deep one hundred and fifty feet now separated us from the surface of the waters the iceberg was by degrees becoming an icefield the mountain a plain my eyes never left the manometer we were still rising diagonally to the surface which sparkled under the electric rays the iceberg was stretching both above and beneath into lengthening slopes mile after mile it was getting thinner at length at six in the morning of that memorable day the th of march the door of the saloon opened and captain nemo appeared the sea is open was all he said chapter xiv the south pole i rushed on to the platform yes the open sea with but a few scattered pieces of ice and moving icebergsa long stretch of sea a world of birds in the air and myriads of fishes under those waters which varied from intense blue to olive green according to the bottom the thermometer marked c above zero it was comparatively spring shut up as we were behind this iceberg whose lengthened mass was dimly seen on our northern horizon are we at the pole i asked the captain with a beating heart i do not know he replied at noon i will take our bearings but will the sun show himself through this fog said i looking at the leaden sky however little it shows it will be enough replied the captain about ten miles south a solitary island rose to a height of one hundred and four yards we made for it but carefully for the sea might be strewn with banks one hour afterwards we had reached it two hours later we had made the round of it it measured four or five miles in circumference a narrow canal separated it from a considerable stretch of land perhaps a continent for we could not see its limits the existence of this land seemed to give some colour to maurys theory the ingenious american has remarked that between the south pole and the sixtieth parallel the sea is covered with floating ice of enormous size which is never met with in the north atlantic from this fact he has drawn the conclusion that the antarctic circle encloses considerable continents as icebergs cannot form in open sea but only on the coasts according to these calculations the mass of ice surrounding the southern pole forms a vast cap the circumference of which must be at least miles but the _nautilus_ for fear of running aground had stopped about three cablelengths from a strand over which reared a superb heap of rocks the boat was launched the captain two of his men bearing instruments conseil and myself were in it it was ten in the morning i had not seen ned land doubtless the canadian did not wish to admit the presence of the south pole a few strokes of the oar brought us to the sand where we ran ashore conseil was going to jump on to the land when i held him back sir said i to captain nemo to you belongs the honour of first setting foot on this land yes sir said the captain and if i do not hesitate to tread this south pole it is because up to this time no human being has left a trace there saying this he jumped lightly on to the sand his heart beat with emotion he climbed a rock sloping to a little promontory and there with his arms crossed mute and motionless and with an eager look he seemed to take possession of these southern regions after five minutes passed in this ecstasy he turned to us when you like sir i landed followed by conseil leaving the two men in the boat for a long way the soil was composed of a reddish sandy stone something like crushed brick scoriae streams of lava and pumicestones one could not mistake its volcanic origin in some parts slight curls of smoke emitted a sulphurous smell proving that the internal fires had lost nothing of their expansive powers though having climbed a high acclivity i could see no volcano for a radius of several miles we know that in those antarctic countries james ross found two craters the erebus and terror in full activity on the th meridian latitude the vegetation of this desolate continent seemed to me much restricted some lichens lay upon the black rocks some microscopic plants rudimentary diatomas a kind of cells placed between two quartz shells long purple and scarlet weed supported on little swimming bladders which the breaking of the waves brought to the shore these constituted the meagre flora of this region the shore was strewn with molluscs little mussels and limpets i also saw myriads of northern clios oneandaquarter inches long of which a whale would swallow a whole world at a mouthful and some perfect seabutterflies animating the waters on the skirts of the shore there appeared on the high bottoms some coral shrubs of the kind which according to james ross live in the antarctic seas to the depth of more than yards then there were little kingfishers and starfish studding the soil but where life abounded most was in the air there thousands of birds fluttered and flew of all kinds deafening us with their cries others crowded the rock looking at us as we passed by without fear and pressing familiarly close by our feet there were penguins so agile in the water heavy and awkward as they are on the ground they were uttering harsh cries a large assembly sober in gesture but extravagant in clamour albatrosses passed in the air the expanse of their wings being at least four yards and a half and justly called the vultures of the ocean some gigantic petrels and some damiers a kind of small duck the underpart of whose body is black and white then there were a whole series of petrels some whitish with brownbordered wings others blue peculiar to the antarctic seas and so oily as i told conseil that the inhabitants of the ferroe islands had nothing to do before lighting them but to put a wick in a little more said conseil and they would be perfect lamps after that we cannot expect nature to have previously furnished them with wicks about half a mile farther on the soil was riddled with ruffs nests a sort of layingground out of which many birds were issuing captain nemo had some hundreds hunted they uttered a cry like the braying of an ass were about the size of a goose slatecolour on the body white beneath with a yellow line round their throats they allowed themselves to be killed with a stone never trying to escape but the fog did not lift and at eleven the sun had not yet shown itself its absence made me uneasy without it no observations were possible how then could we decide whether we had reached the pole when i rejoined captain nemo i found him leaning on a piece of rock silently watching the sky he seemed impatient and vexed but what was to be done this rash and powerful man could not command the sun as he did the sea noon arrived without the orb of day showing itself for an instant we could not even tell its position behind the curtain of fog and soon the fog turned to snow till tomorrow said the captain quietly and we returned to the _nautilus_ amid these atmospheric disturbances the tempest of snow continued till the next day it was impossible to remain on the platform from the saloon where i was taking notes of incidents happening during this excursion to the polar continent i could hear the cries of petrels and albatrosses sporting in the midst of this violent storm the _nautilus_ did not remain motionless but skirted the coast advancing ten miles more to the south in the halflight left by the sun as it skirted the edge of the horizon the next day the th of march the snow had ceased the cold was a little greater the thermometer showing below zero the fog was rising and i hoped that that day our observations might be taken captain nemo not having yet appeared the boat took conseil and myself to land the soil was still of the same volcanic nature everywhere were traces of lava scoriae and basalt but the crater which had vomited them i could not see here as lower down this continent was alive with myriads of birds but their rule was now divided with large troops of seamammals looking at us with their soft eyes there were several kinds of seals some stretched on the earth some on flakes of ice many going in and out of the sea they did not flee at our approach never having had anything to do with man and i reckoned that there were provisions there for hundreds of vessels sir said conseil will you tell me the names of these creatures they are seals and morses it was now eight in the morning four hours remained to us before the sun could be observed with advantage i directed our steps towards a vast bay cut in the steep granite shore there i can aver that earth and ice were lost to sight by the numbers of seamammals covering them and i involuntarily sought for old proteus the mythological shepherd who watched these immense flocks of neptune there were more seals than anything else forming distinct groups male and female the father watching over his family the mother suckling her little ones some already strong enough to go a few steps when they wished to change their place they took little jumps made by the contraction of their bodies and helped awkwardly enough by their imperfect fin which as with the lamantin their cousins forms a perfect forearm i should say that in the water which is their elementthe spine of these creatures is flexible with smooth and close skin and webbed feetthey swim admirably in resting on the earth they take the most graceful attitudes thus the ancients observing their soft and expressive looks which cannot be surpassed by the most beautiful look a woman can give their clear voluptuous eyes their charming positions and the poetry of their manners metamorphosed them the male into a triton and the female into a mermaid i made conseil notice the considerable development of the lobes of the brain in these interesting cetaceans no mammal except man has such a quantity of brain matter they are also capable of receiving a certain amount of education are easily domesticated and i think with other naturalists that if properly taught they would be of great service as fishingdogs the greater part of them slept on the rocks or on the sand amongst these seals properly so called which have no external ears in which they differ from the otter whose ears are prominent i noticed several varieties of seals about three yards long with a white coat bulldog heads armed with teeth in both jaws four incisors at the top and four at the bottom and two large canine teeth in the shape of a fleurdelis amongst them glided seaelephants a kind of seal with short flexible trunks the giants of this species measured twenty feet round and ten yards and a half in length but they did not move as we approached these creatures are not dangerous asked conseil no not unless you attack them when they have to defend their young their rage is terrible and it is not uncommon for them to break the fishingboats to pieces they are quite right said conseil i do not say they are not two miles farther on we were stopped by the promontory which shelters the bay from the southerly winds beyond it we heard loud bellowings such as a troop of ruminants would produce good said conseil a concert of bulls no a concert of morses they are fighting they are either fighting or playing we now began to climb the blackish rocks amid unforeseen stumbles and over stones which the ice made slippery more than once i rolled over at the expense of my loins conseil more prudent or more steady did not stumble and helped me up saying if sir you would have the kindness to take wider steps you would preserve your equilibrium better arrived at the upper ridge of the promontory i saw a vast white plain covered with morses they were playing amongst themselves and what we heard were bellowings of pleasure not of anger as i passed these curious animals i could examine them leisurely for they did not move their skins were thick and rugged of a yellowish tint approaching to red their hair was short and scant some of them were four yards and a quarter long quieter and less timid than their cousins of the north they did not like them place sentinels round the outskirts of their encampment after examining this city of morses i began to think of returning it was eleven oclock and if captain nemo found the conditions favourable for observations i wished to be present at the operation we followed a narrow pathway running along the summit of the steep shore at halfpast eleven we had reached the place where we landed the boat had run aground bringing the captain i saw him standing on a block of basalt his instruments near him his eyes fixed on the northern horizon near which the sun was then describing a lengthened curve i took my place beside him and waited without speaking noon arrived and as before the sun did not appear it was a fatality observations were still wanting if not accomplished tomorrow we must give up all idea of taking any we were indeed exactly at the th of march tomorrow the st would be the equinox the sun would disappear behind the horizon for six months and with its disappearance the long polar night would begin since the september equinox it had emerged from the northern horizon rising by lengthened spirals up to the st of december at this period the summer solstice of the northern regions it had begun to descend and tomorrow was to shed its last rays upon them i communicated my fears and observations to captain nemo you are right m aronnax said he if tomorrow i cannot take the altitude of the sun i shall not be able to do it for six months but precisely because chance has led me into these seas on the st of march my bearings will be easy to take if at twelve we can see the sun why captain because then the orb of day described such lengthened curves that it is difficult to measure exactly its height above the horizon and grave errors may be made with instruments what will you do then i shall only use my chronometer replied captain nemo if tomorrow the st of march the disc of the sun allowing for refraction is exactly cut by the northern horizon it will show that i am at the south pole just so said i but this statement is not mathematically correct because the equinox does not necessarily begin at noon very likely sir but the error will not be a hundred yards and we do not want more till tomorrow then captain nemo returned on board conseil and i remained to survey the shore observing and studying until five oclock then i went to bed not however without invoking like the indian the favour of the radiant orb the next day the st of march at five in the morning i mounted the platform i found captain nemo there the weather is lightening a little said he i have some hope after breakfast we will go on shore and choose a post for observation that point settled i sought ned land i wanted to take him with me but the obstinate canadian refused and i saw that his taciturnity and his bad humour grew day by day after all i was not sorry for his obstinacy under the circumstances indeed there were too many seals on shore and we ought not to lay such temptation in this unreflecting fishermans way breakfast over we went on shore the _nautilus_ had gone some miles further up in the night it was a whole league from the coast above which reared a sharp peak about five hundred yards high the boat took with me captain nemo two men of the crew and the instruments which consisted of a chronometer a telescope and a barometer while crossing i saw numerous whales belonging to the three kinds peculiar to the southern seas the whale or the english right whale which has no dorsal fin the humpback with reeved chest and large whitish fins which in spite of its name do not form wings and the finback of a yellowish brown the liveliest of all the cetacea this powerful creature is heard a long way off when he throws to a great height columns of air and vapour which look like whirlwinds of smoke these different mammals were disporting themselves in troops in the quiet waters and i could see that this basin of the antarctic pole serves as a place of refuge to the cetacea too closely tracked by the hunters i also noticed large medusæ floating between the reeds at nine we landed the sky was brightening the clouds were flying to the south and the fog seemed to be leaving the cold surface of the waters captain nemo went towards the peak which he doubtless meant to be his observatory it was a painful ascent over the sharp lava and the pumicestones in an atmosphere often impregnated with a sulphurous smell from the smoking cracks for a man unaccustomed to walk on land the captain climbed the steep slopes with an agility i never saw equalled and which a hunter would have envied we were two hours getting to the summit of this peak which was half porphyry and half basalt from thence we looked upon a vast sea which towards the north distinctly traced its boundary line upon the sky at our feet lay fields of dazzling whiteness over our heads a pale azure free from fog to the north the disc of the sun seemed like a ball of fire already horned by the cutting of the horizon from the bosom of the water rose sheaves of liquid jets by hundreds in the distance lay the _nautilus_ like a cetacean asleep on the water behind us to the south and east an immense country and a chaotic heap of rocks and ice the limits of which were not visible on arriving at the summit captain nemo carefully took the mean height of the barometer for he would have to consider that in taking his observations at a quarter to twelve the sun then seen only by refraction looked like a golden disc shedding its last rays upon this deserted continent and seas which never man had yet ploughed captain nemo furnished with a lenticular glass which by means of a mirror corrected the refraction watched the orb sinking below the horizon by degrees following a lengthened diagonal i held the chronometer my heart beat fast if the disappearance of the halfdisc of the sun coincided with twelve oclock on the chronometer we were at the pole itself twelve i exclaimed the south pole replied captain nemo in a grave voice handing me the glass which showed the orb cut in exactly equal parts by the horizon i looked at the last rays crowning the peak and the shadows mounting by degrees up its slopes at that moment captain nemo resting with his hand on my shoulder said i captain nemo on this st day of march have reached the south pole on the ninetieth degree and i take possession of this part of the globe equal to onesixth of the known continents in whose name captain in my own sir saying which captain nemo unfurled a black banner bearing an n in gold quartered on its bunting then turning towards the orb of day whose last rays lapped the horizon of the sea he exclaimed adieu sun disappear thou radiant orb rest beneath this open sea and let a night of six months spread its shadows over my new domains chapter xv accident or incident the next day the nd of march at six in the morning preparations for departure were begun the last gleams of twilight were melting into night the cold was great the constellations shone with wonderful intensity in the zenith glittered that wondrous southern crossthe polar bear of antarctic regions the thermometer showed below zero and when the wind freshened it was most biting flakes of ice increased on the open water the sea seemed everywhere alike numerous blackish patches spread on the surface showing the formation of fresh ice evidently the southern basin frozen during the six winter months was absolutely inaccessible what became of the whales in that time doubtless they went beneath the icebergs seeking more practicable seas as to the seals and morses accustomed to live in a hard climate they remained on these icy shores these creatures have the instinct to break holes in the icefield and to keep them open to these holes they come for breath when the birds driven away by the cold have emigrated to the north these sea mammals remain sole masters of the polar continent but the reservoirs were filling with water and the _nautilus_ was slowly descending at feet deep it stopped its screw beat the waves and it advanced straight towards the north at a speed of fifteen miles an hour towards night it was already floating under the immense body of the iceberg at three in the morning i was awakened by a violent shock i sat up in my bed and listened in the darkness when i was thrown into the middle of the room the _nautilus_ after having struck had rebounded violently i groped along the partition and by the staircase to the saloon which was lit by the luminous ceiling the furniture was upset fortunately the windows were firmly set and had held fast the pictures on the starboard side from being no longer vertical were clinging to the paper whilst those of the port side were hanging at least a foot from the wall the _nautilus_ was lying on its starboard side perfectly motionless i heard footsteps and a confusion of voices but captain nemo did not appear as i was leaving the saloon ned land and conseil entered what is the matter said i at once i came to ask you sir replied conseil confound it exclaimed the canadian i know well enough the _nautilus_ has struck and judging by the way she lies i do not think she will right herself as she did the first time in torres straits but i asked has she at least come to the surface of the sea we do not know said conseil it is easy to decide i answered i consulted the manometer to my great surprise it showed a depth of more than fathoms what does that mean i exclaimed we must ask captain nemo said conseil but where shall we find him said ned land follow me said i to my companions we left the saloon there was no one in the library at the centre staircase by the berths of the ships crew there was no one i thought that captain nemo must be in the pilots cage it was best to wait we all returned to the saloon for twenty minutes we remained thus trying to hear the slightest noise which might be made on board the _nautilus_ when captain nemo entered he seemed not to see us his face generally so impassive showed signs of uneasiness he watched the compass silently then the manometer and going to the planisphere placed his finger on a spot representing the southern seas i would not interrupt him but some minutes later when he turned towards me i said using one of his own expressions in the torres straits an incident captain no sir an accident this time serious perhaps is the danger immediate no the _nautilus_ has stranded yes and this has happenedhow from a caprice of nature not from the ignorance of man not a mistake has been made in the working but we cannot prevent equilibrium from producing its effects we may brave human laws but we cannot resist natural ones captain nemo had chosen a strange moment for uttering this philosophical reflection on the whole his answer helped me little may i ask sir the cause of this accident an enormous block of ice a whole mountain has turned over he replied when icebergs are undermined at their base by warmer water or reiterated shocks their centre of gravity rises and the whole thing turns over this is what has happened one of these blocks as it fell struck the _nautilus_ then gliding under its hull raised it with irresistible force bringing it into beds which are not so thick where it is lying on its side but can we not get the _nautilus_ off by emptying its reservoirs that it might regain its equilibrium that sir is being done at this moment you can hear the pump working look at the needle of the manometer it shows that the _nautilus_ is rising but the block of ice is floating with it and until some obstacle stops its ascending motion our position cannot be altered indeed the _nautilus_ still held the same position to starboard doubtless it would right itself when the block stopped but at this moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces i reflected on all the consequences of our position captain nemo never took his eyes off the manometer since the fall of the iceberg the _nautilus_ had risen about a hundred and fifty feet but it still made the same angle with the perpendicular suddenly a slight movement was felt in the hold evidently it was righting a little things hanging in the saloon were sensibly returning to their normal position the partitions were nearing the upright no one spoke with beating hearts we watched and felt the straightening the boards became horizontal under our feet ten minutes passed at last we have righted i exclaimed yes said captain nemo going to the door of the saloon but are we floating i asked certainly he replied since the reservoirs are not empty and when empty the _nautilus_ must rise to the surface of the sea we were in open sea but at a distance of about ten yards on either side of the _nautilus_ rose a dazzling wall of ice above and beneath the same wall above because the lower surface of the iceberg stretched over us like an immense ceiling beneath because the overturned block having slid by degrees had found a restingplace on the lateral walls which kept it in that position the _nautilus_ was really imprisoned in a perfect tunnel of ice more than twenty yards in breadth filled with quiet water it was easy to get out of it by going either forward or backward and then make a free passage under the iceberg some hundreds of yards deeper the luminous ceiling had been extinguished but the saloon was still resplendent with intense light it was the powerful reflection from the glass partition sent violently back to the sheets of the lantern i cannot describe the effect of the voltaic rays upon the great blocks so capriciously cut upon every angle every ridge every facet was thrown a different light according to the nature of the veins running through the ice a dazzling mine of gems particularly of sapphires their blue rays crossing with the green of the emerald here and there were opal shades of wonderful softness running through bright spots like diamonds of fire the brilliancy of which the eye could not bear the power of the lantern seemed increased a hundredfold like a lamp through the lenticular plates of a firstclass lighthouse how beautiful how beautiful cried conseil yes i said it is a wonderful sight is it not ned yes confound it yes answered ned land it is superb i am mad at being obliged to admit it no one has ever seen anything like it but the sight may cost us dear and if i must say all i think we are seeing here things which god never intended man to see ned was right it was too beautiful suddenly a cry from conseil made me turn what is it i asked shut your eyes sir do not look sir saying which conseil clapped his hands over his eyes but what is the matter my boy i am dazzled blinded my eyes turned involuntarily towards the glass but i could not stand the fire which seemed to devour them i understood what had happened the _nautilus_ had put on full speed all the quiet lustre of the icewalls was at once changed into flashes of lightning the fire from these myriads of diamonds was blinding it required some time to calm our troubled looks at last the hands were taken down faith i should never have believed it said conseil it was then five in the morning and at that moment a shock was felt at the bows of the _nautilus_ i knew that its spur had struck a block of ice it must have been a false manœuvre for this submarine tunnel obstructed by blocks was not very easy navigation i thought that captain nemo by changing his course would either turn these obstacles or else follow the windings of the tunnel in any case the road before us could not be entirely blocked but contrary to my expectations the _nautilus_ took a decided retrograde motion we are going backwards said conseil yes i replied this end of the tunnel can have no egress and then then said i the working is easy we must go back again and go out at the southern opening that is all in speaking thus i wished to appear more confident than i really was but the retrograde motion of the _nautilus_ was increasing and reversing the screw it carried us at great speed it will be a hindrance said ned what does it matter some hours more or less provided we get out at last yes repeated ned land provided we do get out at last for a short time i walked from the saloon to the library my companions were silent i soon threw myself on an ottoman and took a book which my eyes overran mechanically a quarter of an hour after conseil approaching me said is what you are reading very interesting sir very interesting i replied i should think so sir it is your own book you are reading my book and indeed i was holding in my hand the work on the great submarine depths i did not even dream of it i closed the book and returned to my walk ned and conseil rose to go stay here my friends said i detaining them let us remain together until we are out of this block as you please sir conseil replied some hours passed i often looked at the instruments hanging from the partition the manometer showed that the _nautilus_ kept at a constant depth of more than three hundred yards the compass still pointed to south the log indicated a speed of twenty miles an hour which in such a cramped space was very great but captain nemo knew that he could not hasten too much and that minutes were worth ages to us at twentyfive minutes past eight a second shock took place this time from behind i turned pale my companions were close by my side i seized conseils hand our looks expressed our feelings better than words at this moment the captain entered the saloon i went up to him our course is barred southward i asked yes sir the iceberg has shifted and closed every outlet we are blocked up then yes chapter xvi want of air thus around the _nautilus_ above and below was an impenetrable wall of ice we were prisoners to the iceberg i watched the captain his countenance had resumed its habitual imperturbability gentlemen he said calmly there are two ways of dying in the circumstances in which we are placed this puzzling person had the air of a mathematical professor lecturing to his pupils the first is to be crushed the second is to die of suffocation i do not speak of the possibility of dying of hunger for the supply of provisions in the _nautilus_ will certainly last longer than we shall let us then calculate our chances as to suffocation captain i replied that is not to be feared because our reservoirs are full just so but they will only yield two days supply of air now for thirtysix hours we have been hidden under the water and already the heavy atmosphere of the _nautilus_ requires renewal in fortyeight hours our reserve will be exhausted well captain can we be delivered before fortyeight hours we will attempt it at least by piercing the wall that surrounds us on which side sound will tell us i am going to run the _nautilus_ aground on the lower bank and my men will attack the iceberg on the side that is least thick captain nemo went out soon i discovered by a hissing noise that the water was entering the reservoirs the _nautilus_ sank slowly and rested on the ice at a depth of yards the depth at which the lower bank was immersed my friends i said our situation is serious but i rely on your courage and energy sir replied the canadian i am ready to do anything for the general safety good ned and i held out my hand to the canadian i will add he continued that being as handy with the pickaxe as with the harpoon if i can be useful to the captain he can command my services he will not refuse your help come ned i led him to the room where the crew of the _nautilus_ were putting on their corkjackets i told the captain of neds proposal which he accepted the canadian put on his seacostume and was ready as soon as his companions when ned was dressed i reentered the drawingroom where the panes of glass were open and posted near conseil i examined the ambient beds that supported the _nautilus_ some instants after we saw a dozen of the crew set foot on the bank of ice and among them ned land easily known by his stature captain nemo was with them before proceeding to dig the walls he took the soundings to be sure of working in the right direction long sounding lines were sunk in the side walls but after fifteen yards they were again stopped by the thick wall it was useless to attack it on the ceilinglike surface since the iceberg itself measured more than yards in height captain nemo then sounded the lower surface there ten yards of wall separated us from the water so great was the thickness of the icefield it was necessary therefore to cut from it a piece equal in extent to the waterline of the _nautilus_ there were about cubic yards to detach so as to dig a hole by which we could descend to the icefield the work had begun immediately and carried on with indefatigable energy instead of digging round the _nautilus_ which would have involved greater difficulty captain nemo had an immense trench made at eight yards from the portquarter then the men set to work simultaneously with their screws on several points of its circumference presently the pickaxe attacked this compact matter vigorously and large blocks were detached from the mass by a curious effect of specific gravity these blocks lighter than water fled so to speak to the vault of the tunnel that increased in thickness at the top in proportion as it diminished at the base but that mattered little so long as the lower part grew thinner after two hours hard work ned land came in exhausted he and his comrades were replaced by new workers whom conseil and i joined the second lieutenant of the _nautilus_ superintended us the water seemed singularly cold but i soon got warm handling the pickaxe my movements were free enough although they were made under a pressure of thirty atmospheres when i reentered after working two hours to take some food and rest i found a perceptible difference between the pure fluid with which the rouquayrol engine supplied me and the atmosphere of the _nautilus_ already charged with carbonic acid the air had not been renewed for fortyeight hours and its vivifying qualities were considerably enfeebled however after a lapse of twelve hours we had only raised a block of ice one yard thick on the marked surface which was about cubic yards reckoning that it took twelve hours to accomplish this much it would take five nights and four days to bring this enterprise to a satisfactory conclusion five nights and four days and we have only air enough for two days in the reservoirs without taking into account said ned that even if we get out of this infernal prison we shall also be imprisoned under the iceberg shut out from all possible communication with the atmosphere true enough who could then foresee the minimum of time necessary for our deliverance we might be suffocated before the _nautilus_ could regain the surface of the waves was it destined to perish in this icetomb with all those it enclosed the situation was terrible but everyone had looked the danger in the face and each was determined to do his duty to the last as i expected during the night a new block a yard square was carried away and still further sank the immense hollow but in the morning when dressed in my corkjacket i traversed the slushy mass at a temperature of six or seven degrees below zero i remarked that the side walls were gradually closing in the beds of water farthest from the trench that were not warmed by the mens work showed a tendency to solidification in presence of this new and imminent danger what would become of our chances of safety and how hinder the solidification of this liquid medium that would burst the partitions of the _nautilus_ like glass i did not tell my companions of this new danger what was the good of damping the energy they displayed in the painful work of escape but when i went on board again i told captain nemo of this grave complication i know it he said in that calm tone which could counteract the most terrible apprehensions it is one danger more but i see no way of escaping it the only chance of safety is to go quicker than solidification we must be beforehand with it that is all on this day for several hours i used my pickaxe vigorously the work kept me up besides to work was to quit the _nautilus_ and breathe directly the pure air drawn from the reservoirs and supplied by our apparatus and to quit the impoverished and vitiated atmosphere towards evening the trench was dug one yard deeper when i returned on board i was nearly suffocated by the carbonic acid with which the air was filledah if we had only the chemical means to drive away this deleterious gas we had plenty of oxygen all this water contained a considerable quantity and by dissolving it with our powerful piles it would restore the vivifying fluid i had thought well over it but of what good was that since the carbonic acid produced by our respiration had invaded every part of the vessel to absorb it it was necessary to fill some jars with caustic potash and to shake them incessantly now this substance was wanting on board and nothing could replace it on that evening captain nemo ought to open the taps of his reservoirs and let some pure air into the interior of the _nautilus_ without this precaution we could not get rid of the sense of suffocation the next day march th i resumed my miners work in beginning the fifth yard the side walls and the lower surface of the iceberg thickened visibly it was evident that they would meet before the _nautilus_ was able to disengage itself despair seized me for an instant my pickaxe nearly fell from my hands what was the good of digging if i must be suffocated crushed by the water that was turning into stonea punishment that the ferocity of the savages even would not have invented just then captain nemo passed near me i touched his hand and showed him the walls of our prison the wall to port had advanced to at least four yards from the hull of the _nautilus_ the captain understood me and signed me to follow him we went on board i took off my corkjacket and accompanied him into the drawingroom m aronnax we must attempt some desperate means or we shall be sealed up in this solidified water as in cement yes but what is to be done ah if my _nautilus_ were strong enough to bear this pressure without being crushed well i asked not catching the captains idea do you not understand he replied that this congelation of water will help us do you not see that by its solidification it would burst through this field of ice that imprisons us as when it freezes it bursts the hardest stones do you not perceive that it would be an agent of safety instead of destruction yes captain perhaps but whatever resistance to crushing the _nautilus_ possesses it could not support this terrible pressure and would be flattened like an iron plate i know it sir therefore we must not reckon on the aid of nature but on our own exertions we must stop this solidification not only will the side walls be pressed together but there is not ten feet of water before or behind the _nautilus_ the congelation gains on us on all sides how long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on board the captain looked in my face after tomorrow they will be empty a cold sweat came over me however ought i to have been astonished at the answer on march the _nautilus_ was in the open polar seas we were at for five days we had lived on the reserve on board and what was left of the respirable air must be kept for the workers even now as i write my recollection is still so vivid that an involuntary terror seizes me and my lungs seem to be without air meanwhile captain nemo reflected silently and evidently an idea had struck him but he seemed to reject it at last these words escaped his lips boiling water he muttered boiling water i cried yes sir we are enclosed in a space that is relatively confined would not jets of boiling water constantly injected by the pumps raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation let us try it i said resolutely let us try it professor the thermometer then stood at outside captain nemo took me to the galleys where the vast distillatory machines stood that furnished the drinkable water by evaporation they filled these with water and all the electric heat from the piles was thrown through the worms bathed in the liquid in a few minutes this water reached it was directed towards the pumps while fresh water replaced it in proportion the heat developed by the troughs was such that cold water drawn up from the sea after only having gone through the machines came boiling into the body of the pump the injection was begun and three hours after the thermometer marked below zero outside one degree was gained two hours later the thermometer only marked we shall succeed i said to the captain after having anxiously watched the result of the operation i think he answered that we shall not be crushed we have no more suffocation to fear during the night the temperature of the water rose to below zero the injections could not carry it to a higher point but as the congelation of the seawater produces at least i was at least reassured against the dangers of solidification the next day march th six yards of ice had been cleared twelve feet only remaining to be cleared away there was yet fortyeight hours work the air could not be renewed in the interior of the _nautilus_ and this day would make it worse an intolerable weight oppressed me towards three oclock in the evening this feeling rose to a violent degree yawns dislocated my jaws my lungs panted as they inhaled this burning fluid which became rarefied more and more a moral torpor took hold of me i was powerless almost unconscious my brave conseil though exhibiting the same symptoms and suffering in the same manner never left me he took my hand and encouraged me and i heard him murmur oh if i could only not breathe so as to leave more air for my master tears came into my eyes on hearing him speak thus if our situation to all was intolerable in the interior with what haste and gladness would we put on our corkjackets to work in our turn pickaxes sounded on the frozen icebeds our arms ached the skin was torn off our hands but what were these fatigues what did the wounds matter vital air came to the lungs we breathed we breathed all this time no one prolonged his voluntary task beyond the prescribed time his task accomplished each one handed in turn to his panting companions the apparatus that supplied him with life captain nemo set the example and submitted first to this severe discipline when the time came he gave up his apparatus to another and returned to the vitiated air on board calm unflinching unmurmuring on that day the ordinary work was accomplished with unusual vigour only two yards remained to be raised from the surface two yards only separated us from the open sea but the reservoirs were nearly emptied of air the little that remained ought to be kept for the workers not a particle for the _nautilus_ when i went back on board i was half suffocated what a night i know not how to describe it the next day my breathing was oppressed dizziness accompanied the pain in my head and made me like a drunken man my companions showed the same symptoms some of the crew had rattling in the throat on that day the sixth of our imprisonment captain nemo finding the pickaxes work too slowly resolved to crush the icebed that still separated us from the liquid sheet this mans coolness and energy never forsook him he subdued his physical pains by moral force by his orders the vessel was lightened that is to say raised from the icebed by a change of specific gravity when it floated they towed it so as to bring it above the immense trench made on the level of the waterline then filling his reservoirs of water he descended and shut himself up in the hole just then all the crew came on board and the double door of communication was shut the _nautilus_ then rested on the bed of ice which was not one yard thick and which the sounding leads had perforated in a thousand places the taps of the reservoirs were then opened and a hundred cubic yards of water was let in increasing the weight of the _nautilus_ to tons we waited we listened forgetting our sufferings in hope our safety depended on this last chance notwithstanding the buzzing in my head i soon heard the humming sound under the hull of the _nautilus_ the ice cracked with a singular noise like tearing paper and the _nautilus_ sank we are off murmured conseil in my ear i could not answer him i seized his hand and pressed it convulsively all at once carried away by its frightful overcharge the _nautilus_ sank like a bullet under the waters that is to say it fell as if it was in a vacuum then all the electric force was put on the pumps that soon began to let the water out of the reservoirs after some minutes our fall was stopped soon too the manometer indicated an ascending movement the screw going at full speed made the iron hull tremble to its very bolts and drew us towards the north but if this floating under the iceberg is to last another day before we reach the open sea i shall be dead first half stretched upon a divan in the library i was suffocating my face was purple my lips blue my faculties suspended i neither saw nor heard all notion of time had gone from my mind my muscles could not contract i do not know how many hours passed thus but i was conscious of the agony that was coming over me i felt as if i was going to die suddenly i came to some breaths of air penetrated my lungs had we risen to the surface of the waves were we free of the iceberg no ned and conseil my two brave friends were sacrificing themselves to save me some particles of air still remained at the bottom of one apparatus instead of using it they had kept it for me and while they were being suffocated they gave me life drop by drop i wanted to push back the thing they held my hands and for some moments i breathed freely i looked at the clock it was eleven in the morning it ought to be the th of march the _nautilus_ went at a frightful pace forty miles an hour it literally tore through the water where was captain nemo had he succumbed were his companions dead with him at the moment the manometer indicated that we were not more than twenty feet from the surface a mere plate of ice separated us from the atmosphere could we not break it perhaps in any case the _nautilus_ was going to attempt it i felt that it was in an oblique position lowering the stern and raising the bows the introduction of water had been the means of disturbing its equilibrium then impelled by its powerful screw it attacked the icefield from beneath like a formidable batteringram it broke it by backing and then rushing forward against the field which gradually gave way and at last dashing suddenly against it shot forwards on the icefield that crushed beneath its weight the panel was openedone might say torn offand the pure air came in in abundance to all parts of the _nautilus_ chapter xvii from cape horn to the amazon how i got on to the platform i have no idea perhaps the canadian had carried me there but i breathed i inhaled the vivifying seaair my two companions were getting drunk with the fresh particles the other unhappy men had been so long without food that they could not with impunity indulge in the simplest aliments that were given them we on the contrary had no end to restrain ourselves we could draw this air freely into our lungs and it was the breeze the breeze alone that filled us with this keen enjoyment ah said conseil how delightful this oxygen is master need not fear to breathe it there is enough for everybody ned land did not speak but he opened his jaws wide enough to frighten a shark our strength soon returned and when i looked round me i saw we were alone on the platform the foreign seamen in the _nautilus_ were contented with the air that circulated in the interior none of them had come to drink in the open air the first words i spoke were words of gratitude and thankfulness to my two companions ned and conseil had prolonged my life during the last hours of this long agony all my gratitude could not repay such devotion my friends said i we are bound one to the other for ever and i am under infinite obligations to you which i shall take advantage of exclaimed the canadian what do you mean said conseil i mean that i shall take you with me when i leave this infernal _nautilus_ well said conseil after all this are we going right yes i replied for we are going the way of the sun and here the sun is in the north no doubt said ned land but it remains to be seen whether he will bring the ship into the pacific or the atlantic ocean that is into frequented or deserted seas i could not answer that question and i feared that captain nemo would rather take us to the vast ocean that touches the coasts of asia and america at the same time he would thus complete the tour round the submarine world and return to those waters in which the _nautilus_ could sail freely we ought before long to settle this important point the _nautilus_ went at a rapid pace the polar circle was soon passed and the course shaped for cape horn we were off the american point march st at seven oclock in the evening then all our past sufferings were forgotten the remembrance of that imprisonment in the ice was effaced from our minds we only thought of the future captain nemo did not appear again either in the drawingroom or on the platform the point shown each day on the planisphere and marked by the lieutenant showed me the exact direction of the _nautilus_ now on that evening it was evident to my great satisfaction that we were going back to the north by the atlantic the next day april st when the _nautilus_ ascended to the surface some minutes before noon we sighted land to the west it was terra del fuego which the first navigators named thus from seeing the quantity of smoke that rose from the natives huts the coast seemed low to me but in the distance rose high mountains i even thought i had a glimpse of mount sarmiento that rises yards above the level of the sea with a very pointed summit which according as it is misty or clear is a sign of fine or of wet weather at this moment the peak was clearly defined against the sky the _nautilus_ diving again under the water approached the coast which was only some few miles off from the glass windows in the drawingroom i saw long seaweeds and gigantic fuci and varech of which the open polar sea contains so many specimens with their sharp polished filaments they measured about yards in lengthreal cables thicker than ones thumb and having great tenacity they are often used as ropes for vessels another weed known as velp with leaves four feet long buried in the coral concretions hung at the bottom it served as nest and food for myriads of crustacea and molluscs crabs and cuttlefish there seals and otters had splendid repasts eating the flesh of fish with seavegetables according to the english fashion over this fertile and luxuriant ground the _nautilus_ passed with great rapidity towards evening it approached the falkland group the rough summits of which i recognised the following day the depth of the sea was moderate on the shores our nets brought in beautiful specimens of sea weed and particularly a certain fucus the roots of which were filled with the best mussels in the world geese and ducks fell by dozens on the platform and soon took their places in the pantry on board when the last heights of the falklands had disappeared from the horizon the _nautilus_ sank to between twenty and twentyfive yards and followed the american coast captain nemo did not show himself until the rd of april we did not quit the shores of patagonia sometimes under the ocean sometimes at the surface the _nautilus_ passed beyond the large estuary formed by the plata and was on the th of april fiftysix miles off uraguay its direction was northwards and followed the long windings of the coast of south america we had then made miles since our embarkation in the seas of japan about eleven oclock in the morning the tropic of capricorn was crossed on the thirtyseventh meridian and we passed cape frio standing out to sea captain nemo to ned lands great displeasure did not like the neighbourhood of the inhabited coasts of brazil for we went at a giddy speed not a fish not a bird of the swiftest kind could follow us and the natural curiosities of these seas escaped all observation this speed was kept up for several days and in the evening of the th of april we sighted the most easterly point of south america that forms cape san roque but then the _nautilus_ swerved again and sought the lowest depth of a submarine valley which is between this cape and sierra leone on the african coast this valley bifurcates to the parallel of the antilles and terminates at the north by the enormous depression of yards in this place the geological basin of the ocean forms as far as the lesser antilles a cliff of three and a half miles perpendicular in height and at the parallel of the cape verde islands another wall not less considerable that encloses thus all the sunk continent of the atlantic the bottom of this immense valley is dotted with some mountains that give to these submarine places a picturesque aspect i speak moreover from the manuscript charts that were in the library of the _nautilus_charts evidently due to captain nemos hand and made after his personal observations for two days the desert and deep waters were visited by means of the inclined planes the _nautilus_ was furnished with long diagonal broadsides which carried it to all elevations but on the th of april it rose suddenly and land appeared at the mouth of the amazon river a vast estuary the embouchure of which is so considerable that it freshens the seawater for the distance of several leagues the equator was crossed twenty miles to the west were the guianas a french territory on which we could have found an easy refuge but a stiff breeze was blowing and the furious waves would not have allowed a single boat to face them ned land understood that no doubt for he spoke not a word about it for my part i made no allusion to his schemes of flight for i would not urge him to make an attempt that must inevitably fail i made the time pass pleasantly by interesting studies during the days of april th and th the _nautilus_ did not leave the surface of the sea and the net brought in a marvellous haul of zoophytes fish and reptiles some zoophytes had been fished up by the chain of the nets they were for the most part beautiful phyctallines belonging to the actinidian family and among other species the phyctalis protexta peculiar to that part of the ocean with a little cylindrical trunk ornamented with vertical lines speckled with red dots crowning a marvellous blossoming of tentacles as to the molluscs they consisted of some i had already observedturritellas olive porphyras with regular lines intercrossed with red spots standing out plainly against the flesh odd pteroceras like petrified scorpions translucid hyaleas argonauts cuttlefish excellent eating and certain species of calmars that naturalists of antiquity have classed amongst the flyingfish and that serve principally for bait for codfishing i had now an opportunity of studying several species of fish on these shores amongst the cartilaginous ones petromyzonspricka a sort of eel fifteen inches long with a greenish head violet fins greyblue back brown belly silvered and sown with bright spots the pupil of the eye encircled with golda curious animal that the current of the amazon had drawn to the sea for they inhabit fresh waterstuberculated streaks with pointed snouts and a long loose tail armed with a long jagged sting little sharks a yard long grey and whitish skin and several rows of teeth bent back that are generally known by the name of pantouffles vespertilios a kind of red isosceles triangle half a yard long to which pectorals are attached by fleshy prolongations that make them look like bats but that their horny appendage situated near the nostrils has given them the name of seaunicorns lastly some species of balistae the curassavian whose spots were of a brilliant gold colour and the capriscus of clear violet and with varying shades like a pigeons throat i end here this catalogue which is somewhat dry perhaps but very exact with a series of bony fish that i observed in passing belonging to the apteronotes and whose snout is white as snow the body of a beautiful black marked with a very long loose fleshy strip odontognathes armed with spikes sardines nine inches long glittering with a bright silver light a species of mackerel provided with two anal fins centronotes of a blackish tint that are fished for with torches long fish two yards in length with fat flesh white and firm which when they arc fresh taste like eel and when dry like smoked salmon labres half red covered with scales only at the bottom of the dorsal and anal fins chrysoptera on which gold and silver blend their brightness with that of the ruby and topaz goldentailed spares the flesh of which is extremely delicate and whose phosphorescent properties betray them in the midst of the waters orangecoloured spares with long tongues maigres with gold caudal fins dark thorntails anableps of surinam etc notwithstanding this et cetera i must not omit to mention fish that conseil will long remember and with good reason one of our nets had hauled up a sort of very flat ray fish which with the tail cut off formed a perfect disc and weighed twenty ounces it was white underneath red above with large round spots of dark blue encircled with black very glossy skin terminating in a bilobed fin laid out on the platform it struggled tried to turn itself by convulsive movements and made so many efforts that one last turn had nearly sent it into the sea but conseil not wishing to let the fish go rushed to it and before i could prevent him had seized it with both hands in a moment he was overthrown his legs in the air and half his body paralysed crying oh master master help me it was the first time the poor boy had spoken to me so familiarly the canadian and i took him up and rubbed his contracted arms till he became sensible the unfortunate conseil had attacked a crampfish of the most dangerous kind the cumana this odd animal in a medium conductor like water strikes fish at several yards distance so great is the power of its electric organ the two principal surfaces of which do not measure less than twentyseven square feet the next day april th the _nautilus_ approached the dutch coast near the mouth of the maroni there several groups of seacows herded together they were manatees that like the dugong and the stellera belong to the sirenian order these beautiful animals peaceable and inoffensive from eighteen to twentyone feet in length weigh at least sixteen hundredweight i told ned land and conseil that provident nature had assigned an important role to these mammalia indeed they like the seals are designed to graze on the submarine prairies and thus destroy the accumulation of weed that obstructs the tropical rivers and do you know i added what has been the result since men have almost entirely annihilated this useful race that the putrefied weeds have poisoned the air and the poisoned air causes the yellow fever that desolates these beautiful countries enormous vegetations are multiplied under the torrid seas and the evil is irresistibly developed from the mouth of the rio de la plata to florida if we are to believe toussenel this plague is nothing to what it would be if the seas were cleaned of whales and seals then infested with poulps medusæ and cuttlefish they would become immense centres of infection since their waves would not possess these vast stomachs that god had charged to infest the surface of the seas chapter xviii the poulps for several days the _nautilus_ kept off from the american coast evidently it did not wish to risk the tides of the gulf of mexico or of the sea of the antilles april th we sighted martinique and guadaloupe from a distance of about thirty miles i saw their tall peaks for an instant the canadian who counted on carrying out his projects in the gulf by either landing or hailing one of the numerous boats that coast from one island to another was quite disheartened flight would have been quite practicable if ned land had been able to take possession of the boat without the captains knowledge but in the open sea it could not be thought of the canadian conseil and i had a long conversation on this subject for six months we had been prisoners on board the _nautilus_ we had travelled leagues and as ned land said there was no reason why it should come to an end we could hope nothing from the captain of the _nautilus_ but only from ourselves besides for some time past he had become graver more retired less sociable he seemed to shun me i met him rarely formerly he was pleased to explain the submarine marvels to me now he left me to my studies and came no more to the saloon what change had come over him for what cause for my part i did not wish to bury with me my curious and novel studies i had now the power to write the true book of the sea and this book sooner or later i wished to see daylight the land nearest us was the archipelago of the bahamas there rose high submarine cliffs covered with large weeds it was about eleven oclock when ned land drew my attention to a formidable pricking like the sting of an ant which was produced by means of large seaweeds well i said these are proper caverns for poulps and i should not be astonished to see some of these monsters what said conseil cuttlefish real cuttlefish of the cephalopod class no i said poulps of huge dimensions i will never believe that such animals exist said ned well said conseil with the most serious air in the world i remember perfectly to have seen a large vessel drawn under the waves by an octopuss arm you saw that said the canadian yes ned with your own eyes with my own eyes where pray might that be at st malo answered conseil in the port said ned ironically no in a church replied conseil in a church cried the canadian yes friend ned in a picture representing the poulp in question good said ned land bursting out laughing he is quite right i said i have heard of this picture but the subject represented is taken from a legend and you know what to think of legends in the matter of natural history besides when it is a question of monsters the imagination is apt to run wild not only is it supposed that these poulps can draw down vessels but a certain olaus magnus speaks of an octopus a mile long that is more like an island than an animal it is also said that the bishop of nidros was building an altar on an immense rock mass finished the rock began to walk and returned to the sea the rock was a poulp another bishop pontoppidan speaks also of a poulp on which a regiment of cavalry could manœuvre lastly the ancient naturalists speak of monsters whose mouths were like gulfs and which were too large to pass through the straits of gibraltar but how much is true of these stories asked conseil nothing my friends at least of that which passes the limit of truth to get to fable or legend nevertheless there must be some ground for the imagination of the storytellers one cannot deny that poulps and cuttlefish exist of a large species inferior however to the cetaceans aristotle has stated the dimensions of a cuttlefish as five cubits or nine feet two inches our fishermen frequently see some that are more than four feet long some skeletons of poulps are preserved in the museums of trieste and montpelier that measure two yards in length besides according to the calculations of some naturalists one of these animals only six feet long would have tentacles twentyseven feet long that would suffice to make a formidable monster do they fish for them in these days asked ned if they do not fish for them sailors see them at least one of my friends captain paul bos of havre has often affirmed that he met one of these monsters of colossal dimensions in the indian seas but the most astonishing fact and which does not permit of the denial of the existence of these gigantic animals happened some years ago in what is the fact asked ned land this is it in to the northeast of teneriffe very nearly in the same latitude we are in now the crew of the despatchboat alector perceived a monstrous cuttlefish swimming in the waters captain bouguer went near to the animal and attacked it with harpoon and guns without much success for balls and harpoons glided over the soft flesh after several fruitless attempts the crew tried to pass a slipknot round the body of the mollusc the noose slipped as far as the tail fins and there stopped they tried then to haul it on board but its weight was so considerable that the tightness of the cord separated the tail from the body and deprived of this ornament he disappeared under the water indeed is that a fact an indisputable fact my good ned they proposed to name this poulp bouguers cuttlefish what length was it asked the canadian did it not measure about six yards said conseil who posted at the window was examining again the irregular windings of the cliff precisely i replied its head rejoined conseil was it not crowned with eight tentacles that beat the water like a nest of serpents precisely had not its eyes placed at the back of its head considerable development yes conseil and was not its mouth like a parrots beak exactly conseil very well no offence to master he replied quietly if this is not bouguers cuttlefish it is at least one of its brothers i looked at conseil ned land hurried to the window what a horrible beast he cried i looked in my turn and could not repress a gesture of disgust before my eyes was a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous it was an immense cuttlefish being eight yards long it swam crossways in the direction of the _nautilus_ with great speed watching us with its enormous staring green eyes its eight arms or rather feet fixed to its head that have given the name of cephalopod to these animals were twice as long as its body and were twisted like the furies hair one could see the air holes on the inner side of the tentacles the monsters mouth a horned beak like a parrots opened and shut vertically its tongue a horned substance furnished with several rows of pointed teeth came out quivering from this veritable pair of shears what a freak of nature a birds beak on a mollusc its spindlelike body formed a fleshy mass that might weigh to lbs the varying colour changing with great rapidity according to the irritation of the animal passed successively from livid grey to reddish brown what irritated this mollusc no doubt the presence of the _nautilus_ more formidable than itself and on which its suckers or its jaws had no hold yet what monsters these poulps are what vitality the creator has given them what vigour in their movements and they possess three hearts chance had brought us in presence of this cuttlefish and i did not wish to lose the opportunity of carefully studying this specimen of cephalopods i overcame the horror that inspired me and taking a pencil began to draw it perhaps this is the same which the alector saw said conseil no replied the canadian for this is whole and the other had lost its tail that is no reason i replied the arms and tails of these animals are reformed by renewal and in seven years the tail of bouguers cuttlefish has no doubt had time to grow by this time other poulps appeared at the port light i counted seven they formed a procession after the _nautilus_ and i heard their beaks gnashing against the iron hull i continued my work these monsters kept in the water with such precision that they seemed immovable suddenly the _nautilus_ stopped a shock made it tremble in every plate have we struck anything i asked in any case replied the canadian we shall be free for we are floating the _nautilus_ was floating no doubt but it did not move a minute passed captain nemo followed by his lieutenant entered the drawingroom i had not seen him for some time he seemed dull without noticing or speaking to us he went to the panel looked at the poulps and said something to his lieutenant the latter went out soon the panels were shut the ceiling was lighted i went towards the captain a curious collection of poulps i said yes indeed mr naturalist he replied and we are going to fight them man to beast i looked at him i thought i had not heard aright man to beast i repeated yes sir the screw is stopped i think that the horny jaws of one of the cuttlefish is entangled in the blades that is what prevents our moving what are you going to do rise to the surface and slaughter this vermin a difficult enterprise yes indeed the electric bullets are powerless against the soft flesh where they do not find resistance enough to go off but we shall attack them with the hatchet and the harpoon sir said the canadian if you do not refuse my help i will accept it master land we will follow you i said and following captain nemo we went towards the central staircase there about ten men with boardinghatchets were ready for the attack conseil and i took two hatchets ned land seized a harpoon the _nautilus_ had then risen to the surface one of the sailors posted on the top ladderstep unscrewed the bolts of the panels but hardly were the screws loosed when the panel rose with great violence evidently drawn by the suckers of a poulps arm immediately one of these arms slid like a serpent down the opening and twenty others were above with one blow of the axe captain nemo cut this formidable tentacle that slid wriggling down the ladder just as we were pressing one on the other to reach the platform two other arms lashing the air came down on the seaman placed before captain nemo and lifted him up with irresistible power captain nemo uttered a cry and rushed out we hurried after him illustration one of these long arms glided through the opening what a scene the unhappy man seized by the tentacle and fixed to the suckers was balanced in the air at the caprice of this enormous trunk he rattled in his throat he was stifled he cried help help these words spoken in french startled me i had a fellowcountryman on board perhaps several that heartrending cry i shall hear it all my life the unfortunate man was lost who could rescue him from that powerful pressure however captain nemo had rushed to the poulp and with one blow of the axe had cut through one arm his lieutenant struggled furiously against other monsters that crept on the flanks of the _nautilus_ the crew fought with their axes the canadian conseil and i buried our weapons in the fleshy masses a strong smell of musk penetrated the atmosphere it was horrible for one instant i thought the unhappy man entangled with the poulp would be torn from its powerful suction seven of the eight arms had been cut off one only wriggled in the air brandishing the victim like a feather but just as captain nemo and his lieutenant threw themselves on it the animal ejected a stream of black liquid we were blinded with it when the cloud dispersed the cuttlefish had disappeared and my unfortunate countryman with it ten or twelve poulps now invaded the platform and sides of the _nautilus_ we rolled pellmell into the midst of this nest of serpents that wriggled on the platform in the waves of blood and ink it seemed as though these slimy tentacles sprang up like the hydras heads ned lands harpoon at each stroke was plunged into the staring eyes of the cuttle fish but my bold companion was suddenly overturned by the tentacles of a monster he had not been able to avoid ah how my heart beat with emotion and horror the formidable beak of a cuttlefish was open over ned land the unhappy man would be cut in two i rushed to his succour but captain nemo was before me his axe disappeared between the two enormous jaws and miraculously saved the canadian rising plunged his harpoon deep into the triple heart of the poulp i owed myself this revenge said the captain to the canadian ned bowed without replying the combat had lasted a quarter of an hour the monsters vanquished and mutilated left us at last and disappeared under the waves captain nemo covered with blood nearly exhausted gazed upon the sea that had swallowed up one of his companions and great tears gathered in his eyes chapter xix the gulf stream this terrible scene of the th of april none of us can ever forget i have written it under the influence of violent emotion since then i have revised the recital i have read it to conseil and to the canadian they found it exact as to facts but insufficient as to effect to paint such pictures one must have the pen of the most illustrious of our poets the author of the toilers of the deep i have said that captain nemo wept while watching the waves his grief was great it was the second companion he had lost since our arrival on board and what a death that friend crushed stifled bruised by the dreadful arms of a poulp pounded by his iron jaws would not rest with his comrades in the peaceful coral cemetery in the midst of the struggle it was the despairing cry uttered by the unfortunate man that had torn my heart the poor frenchman forgetting his conventional language had taken to his own mother tongue to utter a last appeal amongst the crew of the _nautilus_ associated with the body and soul of the captain recoiling like him from all contact with men i had a fellowcountryman did he alone represent france in this mysterious association evidently composed of individuals of divers nationalities it was one of these insoluble problems that rose up unceasingly before my mind captain nemo entered his room and i saw him no more for some time but that he was sad and irresolute i could see by the vessel of which he was the soul and which received all his impressions the _nautilus_ did not keep on in its settled course it floated about like a corpse at the will of the waves it went at random he could not tear himself away from the scene of the last struggle from this sea that had devoured one of his men ten days passed thus it was not till the st of may that the _nautilus_ resumed its northerly course after having sighted the bahamas at the mouth of the bahama canal we were then following the current from the largest river to the sea that has its banks its fish and its proper temperatures i mean the gulf stream it is really a river that flows freely to the middle of the atlantic and whose waters do not mix with the ocean waters it is a salt river salter than the surrounding sea its mean depth is fathoms its mean breadth ten miles in certain places the current flows with the speed of two miles and a half an hour the body of its waters is more considerable than that of all the rivers in the globe it was on this ocean river that the _nautilus_ then sailed i must add that during the night the phosphorescent waters of the gulf stream rivalled the electric power of our watchlight especially in the stormy weather that threatened us so frequently may th we were still crossing cape hatteras at the height of north carolina the width of the gulf stream there is seventyfive miles and its depth yards the _nautilus_ still went at random all supervision seemed abandoned i thought that under these circumstances escape would be possible indeed the inhabited shores offered anywhere an easy refuge the sea was incessantly ploughed by the steamers that ply between new york or boston and the gulf of mexico and overrun day and night by the little schooners coasting about the several parts of the american coast we could hope to be picked up it was a favourable opportunity notwithstanding the thirty miles that separated the _nautilus_ from the coasts of the union one unfortunate circumstance thwarted the canadians plans the weather was very bad we were nearing those shores where tempests are so frequent that country of waterspouts and cyclones actually engendered by the current of the gulf stream to tempt the sea in a frail boat was certain destruction ned land owned this himself he fretted seized with nostalgia that flight only could cure master he said that day to me this must come to an end i must make a clean breast of it this nemo is leaving land and going up to the north but i declare to you that i have had enough of the south pole and i will not follow him to the north what is to be done ned since flight is impracticable just now we must speak to the captain said he you said nothing when we were in your native seas i will speak now we are in mine when i think that before long the _nautilus_ will be by nova scotia and that there near new foundland is a large bay and into that bay the st lawrence empties itself and that the st lawrence is my river the river by quebec my native townwhen i think of this i feel furious it makes my hair stand on end sir i would rather throw myself into the sea i will not stay here i am stifled the canadian was evidently losing all patience his vigorous nature could not stand this prolonged imprisonment his face altered daily his temper became more surly i knew what he must suffer for i was seized with homesickness myself nearly seven months had passed without our having had any news from land captain nemos isolation his altered spirits especially since the fight with the poulps his taciturnity all made me view things in a different light well sir said ned seeing i did not reply well ned do you wish me to ask captain nemo his intentions concerning us yes sir although he has already made them known yes i wish it settled finally speak for me in my name only if you like but i so seldom meet him he avoids me that is all the more reason for you to go to see him i went to my room from thence i meant to go to captain nemos it would not do to let this opportunity of meeting him slip i knocked at the door no answer i knocked again then turned the handle the door opened i went in the captain was there bending over his worktable he had not heard me resolved not to go without having spoken i approached him he raised his head quickly frowned and said roughly you here what do you want to speak to you captain but i am busy sir i am working i leave you at liberty to shut yourself up cannot i be allowed the same this reception was not encouraging but i was determined to hear and answer everything sir i said coldly i have to speak to you on a matter that admits of no delay what is that sir he replied ironically have you discovered something that has escaped me or has the sea delivered up any new secrets we were at crosspurposes but before i could reply he showed me an open manuscript on his table and said in a more serious tone here m aronnax is a manuscript written in several languages it contains the sum of my studies of the sea and if it please god it shall not perish with me this manuscript signed with my name complete with the history of my life will be shut up in a little floating case the last survivor of all of us on board the _nautilus_ will throw this case into the sea and it will go whither it is borne by the waves this mans name his history written by himself his mystery would then be revealed some day captain i said i can but approve of the idea that makes you act thus the result of your studies must not be lost but the means you employ seem to me to be primitive who knows where the winds will carry this case and in whose hands it will fall could you not use some other means could not you or one of yours never sir he said hastily interrupting me but i and my companions are ready to keep this manuscript in store and if you will put us at liberty at liberty said the captain rising yes sir that is the subject on which i wish to question you for seven months we have been here on board and i ask you today in the name of my companions and in my own if your intention is to keep us here always m aronnax i will answer you today as i did seven months ago whoever enters the _nautilus_ must never quit it you impose actual slavery upon us give it what name you please but everywhere the slave has the right to regain his liberty who denies you this right have i ever tried to chain you with an oath he looked at me with his arms crossed sir i said to return a second time to this subject will be neither to your nor to my taste but as we have entered upon it let us go through with it i repeat it is not only myself whom it concerns study is to me a relief a diversion a passion that could make me forget everything like you i am willing to live obscure in the frail hope of bequeathing one day to future time the result of my labours but it is otherwise with ned land every man worthy of the name deserves some consideration have you thought that love of liberty hatred of slavery can give rise to schemes of revenge in a nature like the canadians that he could think attempt and try i was silenced captain nemo rose whatever ned land thinks of attempts or tries what does it matter to me i did not seek him it is not for my pleasure that i keep him on board as for you m aronnax you are one of those who can understand everything even silence i have nothing more to say to you let this first time you have come to treat of this subject be the last for a second time i will not listen to you i retired our situation was critical i related my conversation to my two companions we know now said ned that we can expect nothing from this man the _nautilus_ is nearing long island we will escape whatever the weather may be but the sky became more and more threatening symptoms of a hurricane became manifest the atmosphere was becoming white and misty on the horizon fine streaks of cirrhous clouds were succeeded by masses of cumuli other low clouds passed swiftly by the swollen sea rose in huge billows the birds disappeared with the exception of the petrels those friends of the storm the barometer fell sensibly and indicated an extreme tension of the vapours the mixture of the storm glass was decomposed under the influence of the electricity that pervaded the atmosphere the tempest burst on the th of may just as the _nautilus_ was floating off long island some miles from the port of new york i can describe this strife of the elements for instead of fleeing to the depths of the sea captain nemo by an unaccountable caprice would brave it at the surface the wind blew from the southwest at first captain nemo during the squalls had taken his place on the platform he had made himself fast to prevent being washed overboard by the monstrous waves i had hoisted myself up and made myself fast also dividing my admiration between the tempest and this extraordinary man who was coping with it the raging sea was swept by huge clouddrifts which were actually saturated with the waves the _nautilus_ sometimes lying on its side sometimes standing up like a mast rolled and pitched terribly about five oclock a torrent of rain fell that lulled neither sea nor wind the hurricane blew nearly forty leagues an hour it is under these conditions that it overturns houses breaks iron gates displaces twentyfour pounders however the _nautilus_ in the midst of the tempest confirmed the words of a clever engineer there is no wellconstructed hull that cannot defy the sea this was not a resisting rock it was a steel spindle obedient and movable without rigging or masts that braved its fury with impunity however i watched these raging waves attentively they measured fifteen feet in height and to yards long and their speed of propagation was thirty feet per second their bulk and power increased with the depth of the water such waves as these at the hebrides have displaced a mass weighing lbs they are they which in the tempest of december rd after destroying the town of yeddo in japan broke the same day on the shores of america the intensity of the tempest increased with the night the barometer as in at reunion during a cyclone fell seventenths at the close of day i saw a large vessel pass the horizon struggling painfully she was trying to lie to under half steam to keep up above the waves it was probably one of the steamers of the line from new york to liverpool or havre it soon disappeared in the gloom at ten oclock in the evening the sky was on fire the atmosphere was streaked with vivid lightning i could not bear the brightness of it while the captain looking at it seemed to envy the spirit of the tempest a terrible noise filled the air a complex noise made up of the howls of the crushed waves the roaring of the wind and the claps of thunder the wind veered suddenly to all points of the horizon and the cyclone rising in the east returned after passing by the north west and south in the inverse course pursued by the circular storm of the southern hemisphere ah that gulf stream it deserves its name of the king of tempests it is that which causes those formidable cyclones by the difference of temperature between its air and its currents a shower of fire had succeeded the rain the drops of water were changed to sharp spikes one would have thought that captain nemo was courting a death worthy of himself a death by lightning as the _nautilus_ pitching dreadfully raised its steel spur in the air it seemed to act as a conductor and i saw long sparks burst from it crushed and without strength i crawled to the panel opened it and descended to the saloon the storm was then at its height it was impossible to stand upright in the interior of the _nautilus_ captain nemo came down about twelve i heard the reservoirs filling by degrees and the _nautilus_ sank slowly beneath the waves through the open windows in the saloon i saw large fish terrified passing like phantoms in the water some were struck before my eyes the _nautilus_ was still descending i thought that at about eight fathoms deep we should find a calm but no the upper beds were too violently agitated for that we had to seek repose at more than twentyfive fathoms in the bowels of the deep but there what quiet what silence what peace who could have told that such a hurricane had been let loose on the surface of that ocean chapter xx from latitude to longitude in consequence of the storm we had been thrown eastward once more all hope of escape on the shores of new york or st lawrence had faded away and poor ned in despair had isolated himself like captain nemo conseil and i however never left each other i said that the _nautilus_ had gone aside to the east i should have said to be more exact the northeast for some days it wandered first on the surface and then beneath it amid those fogs so dreaded by sailors what accidents are due to these thick fogs what shocks upon these reefs when the wind drowns the breaking of the waves what collisions between vessels in spite of their warning lights whistles and alarm bells and the bottoms of these seas look like a field of battle where still lie all the conquered of the ocean some old and already encrusted others fresh and reflecting from their iron bands and copper plates the brilliancy of our lantern on the th of may we were at the extreme south of the bank of newfoundland this bank consists of alluvia or large heaps of organic matter brought either from the equator by the gulf stream or from the north pole by the countercurrent of cold water which skirts the american coast there also are heaped up those erratic blocks which are carried along by the broken ice and close by a vast charnelhouse of molluscs which perish here by millions the depth of the sea is not great at newfoundlandnot more than some hundreds of fathoms but towards the south is a depression of fathoms there the gulf stream widens it loses some of its speed and some of its temperature but it becomes a sea it was on the th of may about miles from hearts content at a depth of more than fathoms that i saw the electric cable lying on the bottom conseil to whom i had not mentioned it thought at first that it was a gigantic seaserpent but i undeceived the worthy fellow and by way of consolation related several particulars in the laying of this cable the first one was laid in the years and but after transmitting about telegrams would not act any longer in the engineers constructed an other one measuring miles in length and weighing tons which was embarked on the great eastern this attempt also failed on the th of may the _nautilus_ being at a depth of more than fathoms was on the precise spot where the rupture occurred which ruined the enterprise it was within miles of the coast of ireland and at halfpast two in the afternoon they discovered that communication with europe had ceased the electricians on board resolved to cut the cable before fishing it up and at eleven oclock at night they had recovered the damaged part they made another point and spliced it and it was once more submerged but some days after it broke again and in the depths of the ocean could not be recaptured the americans however were not discouraged cyrus field the bold promoter of the enterprise as he had sunk all his own fortune set a new subscription on foot which was at once answered and another cable was constructed on better principles the bundles of conducting wires were each enveloped in guttapercha and protected by a wadding of hemp contained in a metallic covering the great eastern sailed on the th of july the operation worked well but one incident occurred several times in unrolling the cable they observed that nails had recently been forced into it evidently with the motive of destroying it captain anderson the officers and engineers consulted together and had it posted up that if the offender was surprised on board he would be thrown without further trial into the sea from that time the criminal attempt was never repeated on the rd of july the great eastern was not more than miles from newfoundland when they telegraphed from ireland the news of the armistice concluded between prussia and austria after sadowa on the th in the midst of heavy fogs they reached the port of hearts content the enterprise was successfully terminated and for its first despatch young america addressed old europe in these words of wisdom so rarely understood glory to god in the highest and on earth peace goodwill towards men i did not expect to find the electric cable in its primitive state such as it was on leaving the manufactory the long serpent covered with the remains of shells bristling with foraminiferae was encrusted with a strong coating which served as a protection against all boring molluscs it lay quietly sheltered from the motions of the sea and under a favourable pressure for the transmission of the electric spark which passes from europe to america in of a second doubtless this cable will last for a great length of time for they find that the guttapercha covering is improved by the seawater besides on this level so well chosen the cable is never so deeply submerged as to cause it to break the _nautilus_ followed it to the lowest depth which was more than fathoms and there it lay without any anchorage and then we reached the spot where the accident had taken place in the bottom of the ocean then formed a valley about miles broad in which mont blanc might have been placed without its summit appearing above the waves this valley is closed at the east by a perpendicular wall more than yards high we arrived there on the th of may and the _nautilus_ was then not more than miles from ireland was captain nemo going to land on the british isles no to my great surprise he made for the south once more coming back towards european seas in rounding the emerald isle for one instant i caught sight of cape clear and the light which guides the thousands of vessels leaving glasgow or liverpool an important question then arose in my mind did the _nautilus_ dare entangle itself in the manche ned land who had reappeared since we had been nearing land did not cease to question me how could i answer captain nemo remained invisible after having shown the canadian a glimpse of american shores was he going to show me the coast of france but the _nautilus_ was still going southward on the th of may it passed in sight of lands end between the extreme point of england and the scilly isles which were left to starboard if we wished to enter the manche he must go straight to the east he did not do so during the whole of the st of may the _nautilus_ described a series of circles on the water which greatly interested me it seemed to be seeking a spot it had some trouble in finding at noon captain nemo himself came to work the ships log he spoke no word to me but seemed gloomier than ever what could sadden him thus was it his proximity to european shores had he some recollections of his abandoned country if not what did he feel remorse or regret for a long while this thought haunted my mind and i had a kind of presentiment that before long chance would betray the captains secrets the next day the st of june the _nautilus_ continued the same process it was evidently seeking some particular spot in the ocean captain nemo took the suns altitude as he had done the day before the sea was beautiful the sky clear about eight miles to the east a large steam vessel could be discerned on the horizon no flag fluttered from its mast and i could not discover its nationality some minutes before the sun passed the meridian captain nemo took his sextant and watched with great attention the perfect rest of the water greatly helped the operation the _nautilus_ was motionless it neither rolled nor pitched i was on the platform when the altitude was taken and the captain pronounced these words it is here he turned and went below had he seen the vessel which was changing its course and seemed to be nearing us i could not tell i returned to the saloon the panels closed i heard the hissing of the water in the reservoirs the _nautilus_ began to sink following a vertical line for its screw communicated no motion to it some minutes later it stopped at a depth of more than fathoms resting on the ground the luminous ceiling was darkened then the panels were opened and through the glass i saw the sea brilliantly illuminated by the rays of our lantern for at least half a mile round us i looked to the port side and saw nothing but an immensity of quiet waters but to starboard on the bottom appeared a large protuberance which at once attracted my attention one would have thought it a ruin buried under a coating of white shells much resembling a covering of snow upon examining the mass attentively i could recognise the everthickening form of a vessel bare of its masts which must have sunk it certainly belonged to past times this wreck to be thus encrusted with the lime of the water must already be able to count many years passed at the bottom of the ocean what was this vessel why did the _nautilus_ visit its tomb could it have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water i knew not what to think when near me in a slow voice i heard captain nemo say at one time this ship was called the marseillais it carried seventyfour guns and was launched in in the th of august commanded by la poypevertrieux it fought boldly against the preston in on the th of july it was at the taking of grenada with the squadron of admiral estaing in on the th of september it took part in the battle of comte de grasse in chesapeake bay in the french republic changed its name on the th of april in the same year it joined the squadron of villaret joyeuse at brest being entrusted with the escort of a cargo of corn coming from america under the command of admiral van stebel on the th and th prairal of the second year this squadron fell in with an english vessel sir today is the th prairal the first of june it is now seventyfour years ago day for day on this very spot in latitude longitude that this vessel after fighting heroically losing its three masts with the water in its hold and the third of its crew disabled preferred sinking with its sailors to surrendering and nailing its colours to the poop disappeared under the waves to the cry of long live the republic the avenger i exclaimed yes sir the avenger a good name muttered captain nemo crossing his arms chapter xxi a hecatomb the way of describing this unlookedfor scene the history of the patriot ship told at first so coldly and the emotion with which this strange man pronounced the last words the name of the avenger the significance of which could not escape me all impressed itself deeply on my mind my eyes did not leave the captain who with his hand stretched out to sea was watching with a glowing eye the glorious wreck perhaps i was never to know who he was from whence he came or where he was going to but i saw the man move and apart from the _savant_ it was no common misanthropy which had shut captain nemo and his companions within the _nautilus_ but a hatred either monstrous or sublime which time could never weaken did this hatred still seek for vengeance the future would soon teach me that but the _nautilus_ was rising slowly to the surface of the sea and the form of the avenger disappeared by degrees from my sight soon a slight rolling told me that we were in the open air at that moment a dull boom was heard i looked at the captain he did not move captain said i he did not answer i left him and mounted the platform conseil and the canadian were already there where did that sound come from i asked it was a gunshot replied ned land i looked in the direction of the vessel i had already seen it was nearing the _nautilus_ and we could see that it was putting on steam it was within six miles of us what is that ship ned by its rigging and the height of its lower masts said the canadian i bet she is a shipofwar may it reach us and if necessary sink this cursed _nautilus_ friend ned replied conseil what harm can it do to the _nautilus_ can it attack it beneath the waves can its cannonade us at the bottom of the sea tell me ned said i can you recognise what country she belongs to the canadian knitted his eyebrows dropped his eyelids and screwed up the corners of his eyes and for a few moments fixed a piercing look upon the vessel no sir he replied i cannot tell what nation she belongs to for she shows no colours but i can declare she is a manofwar for a long pennant flutters from her main mast for a quarter of an hour we watched the ship which was steaming towards us i could not however believe that she could see the _nautilus_ from that distance and still less that she could know what this submarine engine was soon the canadian informed me that she was a large armoured twodecker ram a thick black smoke was pouring from her two funnels her closelyfurled sails were stopped to her yards she hoisted no flag at her mizzenpeak the distance prevented us from distinguishing the colours of her pennant which floated like a thin ribbon she advanced rapidly if captain nemo allowed her to approach there was a chance of salvation for us sir said ned land if that vessel passes within a mile of us i shall throw myself into the sea and i should advise you to do the same i did not reply to the canadians suggestion but continued watching the ship whether english french american or russian she would be sure to take us in if we could only reach her presently a white smoke burst from the fore part of the vessel some seconds after the water agitated by the fall of a heavy body splashed the stern of the _nautilus_ and shortly afterwards a loud explosion struck my ear what they are firing at us i exclaimed so please you sir said ned they have recognised the unicorn and they are firing at us but i exclaimed surely they can see that there are men in the case it is perhaps because of that replied ned land looking at me a whole flood of light burst upon my mind doubtless they knew now how to believe the stories of the pretended monster no doubt on board the _abraham lincoln_ when the canadian struck it with the harpoon commander farragut had recognised in the supposed narwhal a submarine vessel more dangerous than a supernatural cetacean yes it must have been so and on every sea they were now seeking this engine of destruction terrible indeed if as we supposed captain nemo employed the _nautilus_ in works of vengeance on the night when we were imprisoned in that cell in the midst of the indian ocean had he not attacked some vessel the man buried in the coral cemetery had he not been a victim to the shock caused by the _nautilus_ yes i repeat it it must be so one part of the mysterious existence of captain nemo had been unveiled and if his identity had not been recognised at least the nations united against him were no longer hunting a chimerical creature but a man who had vowed a deadly hatred against them all the formidable past rose before me instead of meeting friends on board the approaching ship we could only expect pitiless enemies but the shot rattled about us some of them struck the sea and ricochetted losing themselves in the distance but none touched the _nautilus_ the vessel was not more than three miles from us in spite of the serious cannonade captain nemo did not appear on the platform but if one of the conical projectiles had struck the shell of the _nautilus_ it would have been fatal the canadian then said sir we must do all we can to get out of this dilemma let us signal them they will then perhaps understand that we are honest folks ned land took his handkerchief to wave in the air but he had scarcely displayed it when he was struck down by an iron hand and fell in spite of his great strength upon the deck fool exclaimed the captain do you wish to be pierced by the spur of the _nautilus_ before it is hurled at this vessel captain nemo was terrible to hear he was still more terrible to see his face was deadly pale with a spasm at his heart for an instant it must have ceased to beat his pupils were fearfully contracted he did not speak he roared as with his body thrown forward he wrung the canadians shoulders then leaving him and turning to the ship of war whose shot was still raining around him he exclaimed with a powerful voice ah ship of an accursed nation you know who i am i do not want your colours to know you by look and i will show you mine and on the fore part of the platform captain nemo unfurled a black flag similar to the one he had placed at the south pole at that moment a shot struck the shell of the _nautilus_ obliquely without piercing it and rebounding near the captain was lost in the sea he shrugged his shoulders and addressing me said shortly go down you and your companions go down sir i cried are you going to attack this vessel sir i am going to sink it you will not do that i shall do it he replied coldly and i advise you not to judge me sir fate has shown you what you ought not to have seen the attack has begun go down what is this vessel you do not know very well so much the better its nationality to you at least will be a secret go down we could but obey about fifteen of the sailors surrounded the captain looking with implacable hatred at the vessel nearing them one could feel that the same desire of vengeance animated every soul i went down at the moment another projectile struck the _nautilus_ and i heard the captain exclaim strike mad vessel shower your useless shot and then you will not escape the spur of the _nautilus_ but it is not here that you shall perish i would not have your ruins mingle with those of the avenger i reached my room the captain and his second had remained on the platform the screw was set in motion and the _nautilus_ moving with speed was soon beyond the reach of the ships guns but the pursuit continued and captain nemo contented himself with keeping his distance about four in the afternoon being no longer able to contain my impatience i went to the central staircase the panel was open and i ventured on to the platform the captain was still walking up and down with an agitated step he was looking at the ship which was five or six miles to leeward he was going round it like a wild beast and drawing it eastward he allowed them to pursue but he did not attack perhaps he still hesitated i wished to mediate once more but i had scarcely spoken when captain nemo imposed silence saying i am the law and i am the judge i am the oppressed and there is the oppressor through him i have lost all that i loved cherished and veneratedcountry wife children father and mother i saw all perish all that i hate is there say no more i cast a last look at the manofwar which was putting on steam and rejoined ned and conseil we will fly i exclaimed good said ned what is this vessel i do not know but whatever it is it will be sunk before night in any case it is better to perish with it than be made accomplices in a retaliation the justice of which we cannot judge that is my opinion too said ned land coolly let us wait for night night arrived deep silence reigned on board the compass showed that the _nautilus_ had not altered its course it was on the surface rolling slightly my companions and i resolved to fly when the vessel should be near enough either to hear us or to see us for the moon which would be full in two or three days shone brightly once on board the ship if we could not prevent the blow which threatened it we could at least we would do all that circumstances would allow several times i thought the _nautilus_ was preparing for attack but captain nemo contented himself with allowing his adversary to approach and then fled once more before it part of the night passed without any incident we watched the opportunity for action we spoke little for we were too much moved ned land would have thrown himself into the sea but i forced him to wait according to my idea the _nautilus_ would attack the ship at her waterline and then it would not only be possible but easy to fly at three in the morning full of uneasiness i mounted the platform captain nemo had not left it he was standing at the fore part near his flag which a slight breeze displayed above his head he did not take his eyes from the vessel the intensity of his look seemed to attract and fascinate and draw it onward more surely than if he had been towing it the moon was then passing the meridian jupiter was rising in the east amid this peaceful scene of nature sky and ocean rivalled each other in tranquillity the sea offering to the orbs of night the finest mirror they could ever have in which to reflect their image as i thought of the deep calm of these elements compared with all those passions brooding imperceptibly within the _nautilus_ i shuddered the vessel was within two miles of us it was ever nearing that phosphorescent light which showed the presence of the _nautilus_ i could see its green and red lights and its white lantern hanging from the large foremast an indistinct vibration quivered through its rigging showing that the furnaces were heated to the uttermost sheaves of sparks and red ashes flew from the funnels shining in the atmosphere like stars i remained thus until six in the morning without captain nemo noticing me the ship stood about a mile and a half from us and with the first dawn of day the firing began afresh the moment could not be far off when the _nautilus_ attacking its adversary my companions and myself should for ever leave this man i was preparing to go down to remind them when the second mounted the platform accompanied by several sailors captain nemo either did not or would not see them some steps were taken which might be called the signal for action they were very simple the iron balustrade around the platform was lowered and the lantern and pilot cages were pushed within the shell until they were flush with the deck the long surface of the steel cigar no longer offered a single point to check its manœuvres i returned to the saloon the _nautilus_ still floated some streaks of light were filtering through the liquid beds with the undulations of the waves the windows were brightened by the red streaks of the rising sun and this dreadful day of the nd of june had dawned at five oclock the log showed that the speed of the _nautilus_ was slackening and i knew that it was allowing them to draw nearer besides the reports were heard more distinctly and the projectiles labouring through the ambient water were extinguished with a strange hissing noise my friends said i the moment is come one grasp of the hand and may god protect us ned land was resolute conseil calm myself so nervous that i knew not how to contain myself we all passed into the library but the moment i pushed the door opening on to the central staircase i heard the upper panel close sharply the canadian rushed on to the stairs but i stopped him a wellknown hissing noise told me that the water was running into the reservoirs and in a few minutes the _nautilus_ was some yards beneath the surface of the waves i understood the manœuvre it was too late to act the _nautilus_ did not wish to strike at the impenetrable cuirass but below the waterline where the metallic covering no longer protected it we were again imprisoned unwilling witnesses of the dreadful drama that was preparing we had scarcely time to reflect taking refuge in my room we looked at each other without speaking a deep stupor had taken hold of my mind thought seemed to stand still i was in that painful state of expectation preceding a dreadful report i waited i listened every sense was merged in that of hearing the speed of the _nautilus_ was accelerated it was preparing to rush the whole ship trembled suddenly i screamed i felt the shock but comparatively light i felt the penetrating power of the steel spur i heard rattlings and scrapings but the _nautilus_ carried along by its propelling power passed through the mass of the vessel like a needle through sailcloth i could stand it no longer mad out of my mind i rushed from my room into the saloon captain nemo was there mute gloomy implacable he was looking through the port panel a large mass cast a shadow on the water and that it might lose nothing of her agony the _nautilus_ was going down into the abyss with her ten yards from me i saw the open shell through which the water was rushing with the noise of thunder then the double line of guns and the netting the bridge was covered with black agitated shadows the water was rising the poor creatures were crowding the ratlines clinging to the masts struggling under the water it was a human antheap overtaken by the sea paralysed stiffened with anguish my hair standing on end with eyes wide open panting without breath and without voice i too was watching an irresistible attraction glued me to the glass suddenly an explosion took place the compressed air blew up her decks as if the magazines had caught fire then the unfortunate vessel sank more rapidly her topmast laden with victims now appeared then her spars bending under the weight of men and last of all the top of her mainmast then the dark mass disappeared and with it the dead crew drawn down by the strong eddy illustration the unfortunate vessel sank more rapidly i turned to captain nemo that terrible avenger a perfect archangel of hatred was still looking when all was over he turned to his room opened the door and entered i followed him with my eyes on the end wall beneath his heroes i saw the portrait of a woman still young and two little children captain nemo looked at them for some moments stretched his arms towards them and kneeling down burst into deep sobs chapter xxii the last words of captain nemo the panels had closed on this dreadful vision but light had not returned to the saloon all was silence and darkness within the _nautilus_ at wonderful speed a hundred feet beneath the water it was leaving this desolate spot whither was it going to the north or south where was the man flying to after such dreadful retaliation i had returned to my room where ned and conseil had remained silent enough i felt an insurmountable horror for captain nemo whatever he had suffered at the hands of these men he had no right to punish thus he had made me if not an accomplice at least a witness of his vengeance at eleven the electric light reappeared i passed into the saloon it was deserted i consulted the different instruments the _nautilus_ was flying northward at the rate of twentyfive miles an hour now on the surface and now thirty feet below it on taking the bearings by the chart i saw that we were passing the mouth of the manche and that our course was hurrying us towards the northern seas at a frightful speed that night we had crossed two hundred leagues of the atlantic the shadows fell and the sea was covered with darkness until the rising of the moon i went to my room but could not sleep i was troubled with dreadful nightmare the horrible scene of destruction was continually before my eyes from that day who could tell into what part of the north atlantic basin the _nautilus_ would take us still with unaccountable speed still in the midst of these northern fogs would it touch at spitzbergen or on the shores of nova zembla should we explore those unknown seas the white sea the sea of kara the gulf of obi the archipelago of liarrov and the unknown coast of asia i could not say i could no longer judge of the time that was passing the clocks had been stopped on board it seemed as in polar countries that night and day no longer followed their regular course i felt myself being drawn into that strange region where the foundered imagination of edgar poe roamed at will like the fabulous gordon pym at every moment i expected to see that veiled human figure of larger proportions than those of any inhabitant of the earth thrown across the cataract which defends the approach to the pole i estimated though perhaps i may be mistakeni estimated this adventurous course of the _nautilus_ to have lasted fifteen or twenty days and i know not how much longer it might have lasted had it not been for the catastrophe which ended this voyage of captain nemo i saw nothing whatever now nor of his second not a man of the crew was visible for an instant the _nautilus_ was almost incessantly under water when we came to the surface to renew the air the panels opened and shut mechanically there were no more marks on the planisphere i knew not where we were and the canadian too his strength and patience at an end appeared no more conseil could not draw a word from him and fearing that in a dreadful fit of madness he might kill himself watched him with constant devotion one morning what date it was i could not say i had fallen into a heavy sleep towards the early hours a sleep both painful and unhealthy when i suddenly awoke ned land was leaning over me saying in a low voice we are going to fly i sat up when shall we go i asked tonight all inspection on board the _nautilus_ seems to have ceased all appear to be stupefied you will be ready sir yes where are we in sight of land i took the reckoning this morning in the fogtwenty miles to the east what country is it i do not know but whatever it is we will take refuge there yes ned yes we will fly tonight even if the sea should swallow us up the sea is bad the wind violent but twenty miles in that light boat of the _nautilus_ does not frighten me unknown to the crew i have been able to procure food and some bottles of water i will follow you but continued the canadian if i am surprised i will defend myself i will force them to kill me we will die together friend ned i had made up my mind to all the canadian left me i reached the platform on which i could with difficulty support myself against the shock of the waves the sky was threatening but as land was in those thick brown shadows we must fly i returned to the saloon fearing and yet hoping to see captain nemo wishing and yet not wishing to see him what could i have said to him could i hide the involuntary horror with which he inspired me no it was better that i should not meet him face to face better to forget him and yet how long seemed that day the last that i should pass in the _nautilus_ i remained alone ned land and conseil avoided speaking for fear of betraying themselves at six i dined but i was not hungry i forced myself to eat in spite of my disgust that i might not weaken myself at halfpast six ned land came to my room saying we shall not see each other again before our departure at ten the moon will not be risen we will profit by the darkness come to the boat conseil and i will wait for you the canadian went out without giving me time to answer wishing to verify the course of the _nautilus_ i went to the saloon we were running nne at frightful speed and more than fifty yards deep i cast a last look on these wonders of nature on the riches of art heaped up in this museum upon the unrivalled collection destined to perish at the bottom of the sea with him who had formed it i wished to fix an indelible impression of it in my mind i remained an hour thus bathed in the light of that luminous ceiling and passing in review those treasures shining under their glasses then i returned to my room i dressed myself in strong sea clothing i collected my notes placing them carefully about me my heart beat loudly i could not check its pulsations certainly my trouble and agitation would have betrayed me to captain nemos eyes what was he doing at this moment i listened at the door of his room i heard steps captain nemo was there he had not gone to rest at every moment i expected to see him appear and ask me why i wished to fly i was constantly on the alert my imagination magnified everything the impression became at last so poignant that i asked myself if it would not be better to go to the captains room see him face to face and brave him with look and gesture it was the inspiration of a madman fortunately i resisted the desire and stretched myself on my bed to quiet my bodily agitation my nerves were somewhat calmer but in my excited brain i saw over again all my existence on board the _nautilus_ every incident either happy or unfortunate which had happened since my disappearance from the _abraham lincoln_the submarine hunt the torres straits the savages of papua the running ashore the coral cemetery the passage of suez the island of santorin the cretan diver vigo bay atlantis the iceberg the south pole the imprisonment in the ice the fight among the poulps the storm in the gulf stream the avenger and the horrible scene of the vessel sunk with all her crew all these events passed before my eyes like scenes in a drama then captain nemo seemed to grow enormously his features to assume superhuman proportions he was no longer my equal but a man of the waters the genie of the sea it was then halfpast nine i held my head between my hands to keep it from bursting i closed my eyes i would not think any longer there was another halfhour to wait another halfhour of a nightmare which might drive me mad at that moment i heard the distant strains of the organ a sad harmony to an undefinable chant the wail of a soul longing to break these earthly bonds i listened with every sense scarcely breathing plunged like captain nemo in that musical ecstasy which was drawing him in spirit to the end of life then a sudden thought terrified me captain nemo had left his room he was in the saloon which i must cross to fly there i should meet him for the last time he would see me perhaps speak to me a gesture of his might destroy me a single word chain me on board but ten was about to strike the moment had come for me to leave my room and join my companions i must not hesitate even if captain nemo himself should rise before me i opened my door carefully and even then as it turned on its hinges it seemed to me to make a dreadful noise perhaps it only existed in my own imagination i crept along the dark stairs of the _nautilus_ stopping at each step to check the beating of my heart i reached the door of the saloon and opened it gently it was plunged in profound darkness the strains of the organ sounded faintly captain nemo was there he did not see me in the full light i do not think he would have noticed me so entirely was he absorbed in the ecstasy i crept along the carpet avoiding the slightest sound which might betray my presence i was at least five minutes reaching the door at the opposite side opening into the library i was going to open it when a sigh from captain nemo nailed me to the spot i knew that he was rising i could even see him for the light from the library came through to the saloon he came towards me silently with his arms crossed gliding like a spectre rather than walking his breast was swelling with sobs and i heard him murmur these words the last which ever struck my ear almighty god enough enough was it a confession of remorse which thus escaped from this mans conscience in desperation i rushed through the library mounted the central staircase and following the upper flight reached the boat i crept through the opening which had already admitted my two companions let us go let us go i exclaimed directly replied the canadian the orifice in the plates of the _nautilus_ was first closed and fastened down by means of a false key with which ned land had provided himself the opening in the boat was also closed the canadian began to loosen the bolts which still held us to the submarine boat suddenly a noise was heard voices were answering each other loudly what was the matter had they discovered our flight i felt ned land slipping a dagger into my hand yes i murmured we know how to die the canadian had stopped in his work but one word many times repeated a dreadful word revealed the cause of the agitation spreading on board the _nautilus_ it was not we the crew were looking after the maelstrom the maelstrom could a more dreadful word in a more dreadful situation have sounded in our ears we were then upon the dangerous coast of norway was the _nautilus_ being drawn into this gulf at the moment our boat was going to leave its sides we knew that at the tide the pentup waters between the islands of ferroe and loffoden rush with irresistible violence forming a whirlpool from which no vessel ever escapes from every point of the horizon enormous waves were meeting forming a gulf justly called the navel of the ocean whose power of attraction extends to a distance of twelve miles there not only vessels but whales are sacrificed as well as white bears from the northern regions it is thither that the _nautilus_ voluntarily or involuntarily had been run by the captain it was describing a spiral the circumference of which was lessening by degrees and the boat which was still fastened to its side was carried along with giddy speed i felt that sickly giddiness which arises from longcontinued whirling round we were in dread our horror was at its height circulation had stopped all nervous influence was annihilated and we were covered with cold sweat like a sweat of agony and what noise around our frail bark what roarings repeated by the echo miles away what an uproar was that of the waters broken on the sharp rocks at the bottom where the hardest bodies are crushed and trees worn away with all the fur rubbed off according to the norwegian phrase what a situation to be in we rocked frightfully the _nautilus_ defended itself like a human being its steel muscles cracked sometimes it seemed to stand upright and we with it we must hold on said ned and look after the bolts we may still be saved if we stick to the _nautilus_ he had not finished the words when we heard a crashing noise the bolts gave way and the boat torn from its groove was hurled like a stone from a sling into the midst of the whirlpool my head struck on a piece of iron and with the violent shock i lost all consciousness chapter xxiii conclusion thus ends the voyage under the seas what passed during that nighthow the boat escaped from the eddies of the maelstromhow ned land conseil and myself ever came out of the gulf i cannot tell but when i returned to consciousness i was lying in a fishermans hut on the loffoden isles my two companions safe and sound were near me holding my hands we embraced each other heartily at that moment we could not think of returning to france the means of communication between the north of norway and the south are rare and i am therefore obliged to wait for the steamboat running monthly from cape north and among the worthy people who have so kindly received us i revise my record of these adventures once more not a fact has been omitted not a detail exaggerated it is a faithful narrative of this incredible expedition in an element inaccessible to man but to which progress will one day open a road shall i be believed i do not know and it matters little after all what i now affirm is that i have a right to speak of these seas under which in less than ten months i have crossed leagues in that submarine tour of the world which has revealed so many wonders but what has become of the _nautilus_ did it resist the pressure of the maelstrom does captain nemo still live and does he still follow under the ocean those frightful retaliations or did he stop after the last hecatomb will the waves one day carry to him this manuscript containing the history of his life shall i ever know the name of this man will the missing vessel tell us by its nationality that of captain nemo i hope so and i also hope that his powerful vessel has conquered the sea at its most terrible gulf and that the _nautilus_ has survived where so many other vessels have been lost if it be soif captain nemo still inhabits the ocean his adopted country may hatred be appeased in that savage heart may the contemplation of so many wonders extinguish for ever the spirit of vengeance may the judge disappear and the philosopher continue the peaceful exploration of the sea if his destiny be strange it is also sublime have i not understood it myself have i not lived ten months of this unnatural life and to the question asked by ecclesiastes three thousand years ago that which is far off and exceeding deep who can find it out two men alone of all now living have the right to give an answer captain nemo and myself

woman i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind he was i take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer they were admirable things for the observerexcellent for drawing the veil from mens motives and actions but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his and yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable memory i had seen little of holmes lately my marriage had drifted us away from each other my own complete happiness and the homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland beyond these signs of his activity however which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little of my former friend and companion one nightit was on the twentieth of march i was returning from a journey to a patient for i had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through baker street as i passed the wellremembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story he was at work again he had risen out of his drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own his manner was not effusive it seldom was but he was glad i think to see me with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion wedlock suits you he remarked i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you seven i answered indeed i should have thought a little more just a trifle more i fancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness then how do you know i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl my dear holmes said i this is too much you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how you deduce it as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it out he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction when i hear you give your reasons i remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair you see but you do not observe the distinction is clear for example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room frequently how often well some hundreds of times then how many are there how many i dont know quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is just my point now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this he threw over a sheet of thick pinktinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table it came by the last post said he read it aloud the note was undated and without either signature or address there will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight oclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated this account of you we have from all quarters received be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask this is indeed a mystery i remarked what do you imagine that it means i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce from it i carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly strong and stiff peculiarthat is the very word said holmes it is not an english paper at all hold it up to the light i did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and a large g with a small t woven into the texture of the paper what do you make of that asked holmes the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather not at all the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft which is the german for company it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves eglow eglonitzhere we are egria it is in a germanspeaking countryin bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glassfactories and papermills ha ha my boy what do you make of that his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette the paper was made in bohemia i said precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note the peculiar construction of the sentencethis account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell holmes whistled a pair by the sound said he yes he continued glancing out of the window a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece theres money in this case watson if there is nothing else i think that i had better go holmes not a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss it but your client never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door then there was a loud and authoritative tap come in said holmes a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules his dress was rich with a richness which would in england be looked upon as akin to bad taste heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his doublebreasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flamecoloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance he carried a broadbrimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy you had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent i told you that i would call he looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address pray take a seat said holmes this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases whom have i the honour to address you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alone i rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair it is both or none said he you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me the count shrugged his broad shoulders then i must begin said he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history i promise said holmes and i you will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own i was aware of it said holmes dryly the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia i was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client if your majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked i should be better able to advise you the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground you are right he cried i am the king why should i attempt to conceal it why indeed murmured holmes your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein grand duke of casselfelstein and hereditary king of bohemia but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power i have come _incognito_ from prague for the purpose of consulting you then pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once more the facts are briefly these some five years ago during a lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt familiar to you kindly look her up in my index doctor murmured holmes without opening his eyes for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staffcommander who had written a monograph upon the deepsea fishes let me see said holmes hum born in new jersey in the year contraltohum la scala hum prima donna imperial opera of warsawyes retired from operatic stageha living in londonquite so your majesty as i understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back precisely so but how was there a secret marriage none no legal papers or certificates none then i fail to follow your majesty if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity there is the writing pooh pooh forgery my private notepaper stolen my own seal imitated my photograph bought we were both in the photograph oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion i was madinsane you have compromised yourself seriously i was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty now it must be recovered we have tried and failed your majesty must pay it must be bought she will not sell stolen then five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she has been waylaid there has been no result no sign of it absolutely none holmes laughed it is quite a pretty little problem said he but a very serious one to me returned the king reproachfully very indeed and what does she propose to do with the photograph to ruin me but how i am about to be married so i have heard to clotilde lothman von saxemeningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end and irene adler threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i know that she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men rather than i should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not gonone you are sure that she has not sent it yet i am sure and why because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday oh then we have three days yet said holmes with a yawn that is very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present your majesty will of course stay in london for the present certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress pray do so i shall be all anxiety then as to money you have _carte blanche_ absolutely i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph and for present expenses the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed it to him and mademoiselles address he asked is briony lodge serpentine avenue st johns wood holmes took a note of it one other question said he was the photograph a cabinet it was then goodnight your majesty and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you and goodnight watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street if you will be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at three oclock i should like to chat this little matter over with you ii at three oclock precisely i was at baker street but holmes had not yet returned the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight oclock in the morning i sat down beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be i was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded still the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head it was close upon four before the door opened and a drunkenlooking groom illkempt and sidewhiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room accustomed as i was to my friends amazing powers in the use of disguises i had to look three times before i was certain that it was indeed he with a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweedsuited and respectable as of old putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair what is it its quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning or what i ended by doing i cant imagine i suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler quite so but the sequel was rather unusual i will tell you however i left the house a little after eight oclock this morning in the character of a groom out of work there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men be one of them and you will know all that there is to know i soon found briony lodge it is a _bijou_ villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories chubb lock to the door large sittingroom on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coachhouse i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interest i then lounged down the street and found as i expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of halfandhalf two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desire about miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to and what of irene adler i asked oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet so say the serpentinemews to a man she lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner seldom goes out at other times except when she sings has only one male visitor but a good deal of him he is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often twice he is a mr godfrey norton of the inner temple see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentinemews and knew all about him when i had listened to all they had to tell i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaign this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter he was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits was she his client his friend or his mistress if the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping if the latter it was less likely on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to the gentlemans chambers in the temple it was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry i fear that i bore you with these details but i have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situation i am following you closely i answered i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out he was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustachedevidently the man of whom i had heard he appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home he was in the house about half an hour and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sittingroom pacing up and down talking excitedly and waving his arms of her i could see nothing presently he emerged looking even more flurried than before as he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly drive like the devil he shouted first to gross hankeys in regent street and then to the church of st monica in the edgeware road half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes away they went and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only halfbuttoned and his tie under his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles it hadnt pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for the church of st monica john she cried and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes this was quite too good to lose watson i was just balancing whether i should run for it or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare but i jumped in before he could object the church of st monica said i and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes it was twentyfive minutes to twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind my cabby drove fast i dont think i ever drove faster but the others were there before us the cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived i paid the man and hurried into the church there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman who seemed to be expostulating with them they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to me and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me thank god he cried youll do come come what then i asked come man come only three minutes or it wont be legal i was halfdragged up to the altar and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear and vouching for things of which i knew nothing and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster to godfrey norton bachelor it was all done in an instant and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now it seems that there had been some informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man the bride gave me a sovereign and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion this is a very unexpected turn of affairs said i and what then well i found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house i shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him i heard no more they drove away in different directions and i went off to make my own arrangements which are some cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing the bell i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely to be busier still this evening by the way doctor i shall want your cooperation i shall be delighted you dont mind breaking the law not in the least nor running a chance of arrest not in a good cause oh the cause is excellent then i am your man i was sure that i might rely on you but what is it you wish when mrs turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided i must discuss it while i eat for i have not much time it is nearly five now in two hours we must be on the scene of action miss irene or madame rather returns from her drive at seven we must be at briony lodge to meet her and what then you must leave that to me i have already arranged what is to occur there is only one point on which i must insist you must not interfere come what may you understand i am to be neutral to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small unpleasantness do not join in it it will end in my being conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the sittingroom window will open you are to station yourself close to that open window yes you are to watch me for i will be visible to you yes and when i raise my handsoyou will throw into the room what i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire you quite follow me entirely it is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigarshaped roll from his pocket it is an ordinary plumbers smokerocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it selflighting your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people you may then walk to the end of the street and i will rejoin you in ten minutes i hope that i have made myself clear i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street precisely then you may entirely rely on me that is excellent i think perhaps it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simpleminded nonconformist clergyman his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr john hare alone could have equalled it was not merely that holmes changed his costume his expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed the stage lost a fine actor even as science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crime it was a quarter past six when we left baker street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue it was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge waiting for the coming of its occupant the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected on the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner a scissorsgrinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nursegirl and several welldressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the house this marriage rather simplifies matters the photograph becomes a doubleedged weapon now the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess now the question is where are we to find the photograph where indeed it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is cabinet size too large for easy concealment about a womans dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may take it then that she does not carry it about with her where then her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but i am inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone else she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days it must be where she can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own house but it has twice been burgled pshaw they did not know how to look but how will you look i will not look what then i will get her to show me but she will refuse she will not be able to but i hear the rumble of wheels it is her carriage now carry out my orders to the letter as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge as it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention a fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissorsgrinder who was equally hot upon the other side a blow was struck and in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man irene adler as i will still call her had hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back into the street is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked he is dead cried several voices no no theres life in him shouted another but hell be gone before you can get him to hospital hes a brave fellow said a woman they would have had the ladys purse and watch if it hadnt been for him they were a gang and a rough one too ah hes breathing now he cant lie in the street may we bring him in marm surely bring him into the sittingroom there is a comfortable sofa this way please slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room while i still observed the proceedings from my post by the window the lamps had been lit but the blinds had not been drawn so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me i hardened my heart and took the smokerocket from under my ulster after all i thought we are not injuring her we are but preventing her from injuring another holmes had sat up upon the couch and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air a maid rushed across and threw open the window at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of fire the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and illgentlemen ostlers and servant maidsjoined in a general shriek of fire thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window i caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friends arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road you did it very nicely doctor he remarked nothing could have been better it is all right you have the photograph i know where it is and how did you find out she showed me as i told you she would i am still in the dark i do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing the matter was perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening i guessed as much then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle it is an old trick that also i could fathom then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else could she do and into her sittingroom which was the very room which i suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which they laid me on a couch i motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance how did that help you it was allimportant when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewelbox now it was clear to me that our lady of today had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bellpull she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out when i cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and i have not seen her since i rose and making my excuses escaped from the house i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait a little overprecipitance may ruin all and now i asked our quest is practically finished i shall call with the king tomorrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be shown into the sittingroom to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands and when will you call at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits i must wire to the king without delay we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said goodnight mister sherlock holmes there were several people on the pavement at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by ive heard that voice before said holmes staring down the dimly lit street now i wonder who the deuce that could have been iii i slept at baker street that night and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room you have really got it he cried grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face not yet but you have hopes i have hopes then come i am all impatience to be gone we must have a cab no my brougham is waiting then that will simplify matters we descended and started off once more for briony lodge irene adler is married remarked holmes married when yesterday but to whom to an english lawyer named norton but she could not love him i am in hopes that she does and why in hopes because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty if she does not love your majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your majestys plan it is true and yet well i wish she had been of my own station what a queen she would have made he relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon the steps she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham mr sherlock holmes i believe said she i am mr holmes answered my companion looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she left this morning with her husband by the train from charing cross for the continent what sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise do you mean that she has left england never to return and the papers asked the king hoarsely all is lost we shall see he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawingroom followed by the king and myself the furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight holmes rushed at the bellpull tore back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to sherlock holmes esq to be left till called for my friend tore it open and we all three read it together it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way my dear mr sherlock holmesyou really did it very well you took me in completely until after the alarm of fire i had not a suspicion but then when i found how i had betrayed myself i began to think i had been warned against you months ago i had been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you and your address had been given me yet with all this you made me reveal what you wanted to know even after i became suspicious i found it hard to think evil of such a dear kind old clergyman but you know i have been trained as an actress myself male costume is nothing new to me i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives i sent john the coachman to watch you ran upstairs got into my walking clothes as i call them and came down just as you departed well i followed you to your door and so made sure that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock holmes then i rather imprudently wished you goodnight and started for the temple to see my husband we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when you call tomorrow as to the photograph your client may rest in peace i love and am loved by a better man than he the king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged i keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future i leave a photograph which he might care to possess and i remain dear mr sherlock holmes very truly yours irene norton _née_ adler what a womanoh what a woman cried the king of bohemia when we had all three read this epistle did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was would she not have made an admirable queen is it not a pity that she was not on my level from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty said holmes coldly i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majestys business to a more successful conclusion on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be more successful i know that her word is inviolate the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire i am glad to hear your majesty say so i am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way i can reward you this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand your majesty has something which i should value even more highly said holmes you have but to name it this photograph the king stared at him in amazement irenes photograph he cried certainly if you wish it i thank your majesty then there is no more to be done in the matter i have the honour to wish you a very good morning he bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambers and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were beaten by a womans wit he used to make merry over the cleverness of women but i have not heard him do it of late and when he speaks of irene adler or when he refers to her photograph it is always under the honourable title of _the_ woman ii the redheaded league i had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout floridfaced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair with an apology for my intrusion i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson he said cordially i was afraid that you were engaged so i am very much so then i can wait in the next room not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small fatencircled eyes try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in judicial moods i know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me i observed you will remember that i remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man and endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance i did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey shepherds check trousers a not overclean black frockcoat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament a frayed tophat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him altogether look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately i can deduce nothing else mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion how in the name of goodfortune did you know all that mr holmes he asked how did you know for example that i did manual labour its as true as gospel for i began as a ships carpenter your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more developed well the snuff then and the freemasonry i wont insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arcandcompass breastpin ah of course i forgot that but the writing what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk well but china the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watchchain the matter becomes even more simple mr jabez wilson laughed heavily well i never said he i thought at first that you had done something clever but i see that there was nothing in it after all i begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistake in explaining _omne ignotum pro magnifico_ you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson yes i have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began it all you just read it for yourself sir i took the paper from him and read as follows to the redheaded league on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania usa there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of a week for purely nominal services all redheaded men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twentyone years are eligible apply in person on monday at eleven oclock to duncan ross at the offices of the league popes court fleet street what on earth does this mean i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits it is a little off the beaten track isnt it said he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the date it is _the morning chronicle_ of april just two months ago very good now mr wilson well it is just as i have been telling you mr sherlock holmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead i have a small pawnbrokers business at coburg square near the city its not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living i used to be able to keep two assistants but now i only keep one and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes his name is vincent spaulding and hes not such a youth either its hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who comes under the full market price it is not a common experience among employers in this age i dont know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement oh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such a fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker theres no vice in him he is still with you i presume yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place cleanthats all i have in the house for i am a widower and never had any family we live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more the first thing that put us out was that advertisement spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a redheaded man why that i asks why says he heres another vacancy on the league of the redheaded men its worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money if my hair would only change colour heres a nice little crib all ready for me to step into why what is it then i asked you see mr holmes i am a very stayathome man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the doormat in that way i didnt know much of what was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news have you never heard of the league of the redheaded men he asked with his eyes open never why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies and what are they worth i asked oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with ones other occupations well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy tell me all about it said i well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars as far as i can make out the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself redheaded and he had a great sympathy for all redheaded men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do but said i there would be millions of redheaded men who would apply not so many as you might think he answered you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn then again i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement fleet street was choked with redheaded folk and popes court looked like a costers orange barrow i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement every shade of colour they werestraw lemon orange brick irishsetter liver clay but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flamecoloured tint when i saw how many were waiting i would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear of it how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statement there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all however when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has every requirement i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success it would be injustice to hesitate said he you will however i am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until i yelled with the pain there is water in your eyes said he as he released me i perceive that all is as it should be but we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint i could tell you tales of cobblers wax which would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled a groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a redhead to be seen except my own and that of the manager my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are you a married man mr wilson have you a family i answered that i had not his face fell immediately dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed i am sorry to hear you say that the fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the redheads as well as for their maintenance it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor my face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right in the case of another said he the objection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties well it is a little awkward for i have a business already said i oh never mind about that mr wilson said vincent spaulding i should be able to look after that for you what would be the hours i asked ten to two now a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening mr holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is just before payday so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings besides i knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up that would suit me very well said i and the pay is a week and the work is purely nominal what do you call purely nominal well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time if you leave you forfeit your whole position forever the will is very clear upon that point you dont comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time its only four hours a day and i should not think of leaving said i no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose your billet and the work is to copy out the _encyclopædia britannica_ there is the first volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and blottingpaper but we provide this table and chair will you be ready tomorrow certainly i answered then goodbye mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleased at my own good fortune well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was in low spirits again for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its object might be i could not imagine it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the _encyclopædia britannica_ vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing however in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quillpen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off for popes court well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me at two oclock he bade me goodday complimented me upon the amount that i had written and locked the door of the office after me this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my weeks work it was the same next week and the same the week after every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i left at two by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all still of course i never dared to leave the room for an instant for i was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that i would not risk the loss of it eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the bs before very long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an end to an end yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as usual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of notepaper it read in this fashion the redheaded league is dissolved october sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter i cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head if you can do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen i really wouldnt miss your case for the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door i was staggered sir i did not know what to do then i called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it finally i went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the ground floor and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the redheaded league he said that he had never heard of any such body then i asked him who mr duncan ross was he answered that the name was new to him well said i the gentleman at no what the redheaded man yes oh said he his name was william morris he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready he moved out yesterday where could i find him oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes king edward street near st pauls i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial kneecaps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross and what did you do then asked holmes i went home to saxecoburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you and you did very wisely said holmes your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear grave enough said mr jabez wilson why i have lost four pound a week as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a you have lost nothing by them no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prankif it was a prankupon me it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisementhow long had he been with you about a month then how did he come in answer to an advertisement was he the only applicant no i had a dozen why did you pick him because he was handy and would come cheap at half wages in fact yes what is he like this vincent spaulding small stoutbuilt very quick in his ways no hair on his face though hes not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon his forehead holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement i thought as much said he have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings yes sir he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought he is still with you oh yes sir i have only just left him and has your business been attended to in your absence nothing to complain of sir theres never very much to do of a morning that will do mr wilson i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two today is saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all i make nothing of it i answered frankly it is a most mysterious business as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify but i must be prompt over this matter what are you going to do then i asked to smoke he answered it is quite a three pipe problem and i beg that you wont speak to me for fifty minutes he curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawklike nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece sarasate plays at the st jamess hall this afternoon he remarked what do you think watson could your patients spare you for a few hours i have nothing to do today my practice is never very absorbing then put on your hat and come i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french it is introspective and i want to introspect come along we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a short walk took us to saxecoburg square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning it was a poky little shabbygenteel place where four lines of dingy twostoried brick houses looked out into a small railedin enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smokeladen and uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and a brown board with jabez wilson in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our redheaded client carried on his business sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally he returned to the pawnbrokers and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked it was instantly opened by a brightlooking cleanshaven young fellow who asked him to step in thank you said holmes i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away he is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third i have known something of him before evidently said i mr wilsons assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the redheaded league i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him not him what then the knees of his trousers and what did you see what i expected to see why did you beat the pavement my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemys country we know something of saxecoburg square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxecoburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line i should like just to remember the order of the houses here it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london there is mortimers the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlanes carriagebuilding depot that carries us right on to the other block and now doctor weve done our work so its time we had some play a sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violinland where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no redheaded clients to vex us with their conundrums my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuthhound holmes the relentless keenwitted readyhanded criminal agent as it was possible to conceive in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his blackletter editions then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st jamess hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we emerged yes it would be as well and i have some business to do which will take some hours this business at coburg square is serious why serious a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it but today being saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help tonight at what time ten will be early enough i shall be at baker street at ten very well and i say doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket he waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes here i had heard what he had heard i had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the redheaded copier of the _encyclopædia_ down to the visit to saxecoburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me what was this nocturnal expedition and why should i go armed where were we going and what were we to do i had the hint from holmes that this smoothfaced pawnbrokers assistant was a formidable mana man who might play a deep game i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation it was a quarterpast nine when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through oxford street to baker street two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom i recognised as peter jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sadfaced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frockcoat ha our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his peajacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack watson i think you know mr jones of scotland yard let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in tonights adventure were hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in his consequential way our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed mr merryweather gloomily you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said the police agent loftily he has his own little methods which are if he wont mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the stranger with deference still i confess that i miss my rubber it is the first saturday night for sevenandtwenty years that i have not had my rubber i think you will find said sherlock holmes that you will play for a higher stake tonight than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather the stake will be some and for you jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger hes a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london hes a remarkable man is young john clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself hell crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next ive been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight ive had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is past ten however and quite time that we started if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit streets until we emerged into farrington street we are close there now my friend remarked this fellow merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter i thought it as well to have jones with us also he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we are and they are waiting for us we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earthsmelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise i must really ask you to be a little more quiet said holmes severely you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at present doctoras no doubt you have divinedin the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present it is our french gold whispered the director we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it your french gold yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject which were very well justified observed holmes and now it is time that we arranged our little plans i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern and sit in the dark i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a _partie carrée_ you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darknesssuch an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moments notice to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault they have but one retreat whispered holmes that is back through the house into saxecoburg square i hope that you have done what i asked you jones i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and wait what a time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us my limbs were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper heavier inbreath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light for a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones its disappearance however was but momentary with a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern over the edge there peeped a cleancut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulderhigh and waisthigh until one knee rested upon the edge in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair its all clear he whispered have you the chisel and the bags great scott jump archie jump and ill swing for it sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar the other dived down the hole and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes hunting crop came down on the mans wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor its no use john clay said holmes blandly you have no chance at all so i see the other answered with the utmost coolness i fancy that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coattails there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely i must compliment you and i you holmes answered your redheaded idea was very new and effective youll see your pal again presently said jones hes quicker at climbing down holes than i am just hold out while i fix the derbies i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins have the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and please all right said jones with a stare and a snigger well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the policestation that is better said john clay serenely he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr john clay said holmes i have been at some small expense over this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the redheaded league you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league and the copying of the _encyclopædia_ must be to get this not overbright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day it was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was no doubt suggested to clays ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplices hair the a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation but how could you guess what the motive was had there been women in the house i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue that however was out of the question the mans business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure as they were at it must then be something out of the house what could it be i thought of the assistants fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar the cellar there was the end of this tangled clue then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london he was doing something in the cellarsomething which took many hours a day for months on end what could it be once more i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind it was not in front then i rang the bell and as i hoped the assistant answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before i hardly looked at his face his knees were what i wished to see you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for i walked round the corner saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friends premises and felt that i had solved my problem when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen and how could you tell that they would make their attempt tonight i asked well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr jabez wilsons presencein other words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape for all these reasons i expected them to come tonight you reasoned it out beautifully i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration it is so long a chain and yet every link rings true it saved me from ennui he answered yawning alas i already feel it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence these little problems help me to do so and you are a benefactor of the race said i he shrugged his shoulders well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked _lhomme cest rienlœuvre cest tout_ as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand iii a case of identity my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence if we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the crosspurposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations and leading to the most _outré_ results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable and yet i am not convinced of it i answered the cases which come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor artistic a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect remarked holmes this is wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace i smiled and shook my head i can quite understand your thinking so i said of course in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre but herei picked up the morning paper from the groundlet us put it to a practical test here is the first heading upon which i come a husbands cruelty to his wife there is half a column of print but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me there is of course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument said holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it this is the dundas separation case and as it happens i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it the husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average storyteller take a pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your example he held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it ah said he i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers and the ring i asked glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems and have you any on hand just now i asked with interest some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest they are important you understand without being interesting indeed i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motive in these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest it is possible however that i may have something better before very many minutes are over for this is one of my clients or i am much mistaken he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutraltinted london street looking over his shoulder i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck and a large curling red feather in a broadbrimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell i have seen those symptoms before said holmes throwing his cigarette into the fire oscillation upon the pavement always means an _affaire de cœur_ she would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication and yet even here we may discriminate when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts as he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a fullsailed merchantman behind a tiny pilot boat sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting i did at first she answered but now i know where the letters are without looking then suddenly realising the full purport of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad goodhumoured face youve heard about me mr holmes she cried else how could you know all that never mind said holmes laughing it is my business to know things perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook if not why should you come to consult me i came to you sir because i heard of you from mrs etherege whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead oh mr holmes i wish you would do as much for me im not rich but still i have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that i make by the machine and i would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry asked sherlock holmes with his fingertips together and his eyes to the ceiling again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland yes i did bang out of the house she said for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr windibankthat is my fathertook it all he would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done it made me mad and i just on with my things and came right away to you your father said holmes your stepfather surely since the name is different yes my stepfather i call him father though it sounds funny too for he is only five years and two months older than myself and your mother is alive oh yes mother is alive and well i wasnt best pleased mr holmes when she married again so soon after fathers death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines they got for the goodwill and interest which wasnt near as much as father could have got if he had been alive i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention your own little income he asked does it come out of the business oh no sir it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock paying ½ per cent two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but i can only touch the interest you interest me extremely said holmes and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about i could do with much less than that mr holmes but you understand that as long as i live at home i dont wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them of course that is only just for the time mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting it brings me twopence a sheet and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day you have made your position very clear to me said holmes this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr hosmer angel a flush stole over miss sutherlands face and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket i met him first at the gasfitters ball she said they used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he never did wish us to go anywhere he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sundayschool treat but this time i was set on going and i would go for what right had he to prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all fathers friends were to be there and he said that i had nothing fit to wear when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer at last when nothing else would do he went off to france upon the business of the firm but we went mother and i with mr hardy who used to be our foreman and it was there i met mr hosmer angel i suppose said holmes that when mr windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball oh well he was very good about it he laughed i remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way i see then at the gasfitters ball you met as i understand a gentleman called mr hosmer angel yes sir i met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met himthat is to say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more no well you know father didnt like anything of the sort he wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle but then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and i had not got mine yet but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see you well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone we could write in the meantime and he used to write every day i took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know were you engaged to the gentleman at this time oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that we took hosmermr angelwas a cashier in an office in leadenhall streetand what office thats the worst of it mr holmes i dont know where did he live then he slept on the premises and you dont know his address noexcept that it was leadenhall street where did you address your letters then to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called for he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so i offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldnt have that for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think of it was most suggestive said holmes it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel he was a very shy man mr holmes he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous very retiring and gentlemanly he was even his voice was gentle hed had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech he was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfather returned to france mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever happened i would always be true to him mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was then when they talked of marrying within the week i began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him i didnt quite like that mr holmes it seemed funny that i should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me but i didnt want to do anything on the sly so i wrote to father at bordeaux where the company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding it missed him then yes sir for he had started to england just before it arrived ha that was unfortunate your wedding was arranged then for the friday was it to be in church yes sir but very quietly it was to be at st saviours near kings cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st pancras hotel hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a fourwheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street we got to the church first and when the fourwheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes that was last friday mr holmes and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said holmes oh no sir he was too good and kind to leave me so why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened i was to be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us i was always to remember that i was pledged to him and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later it seemed strange talk for a weddingmorning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it most certainly it does your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him yes sir i believe that he foresaw some danger or else he would not have talked so and then i think that what he foresaw happened but you have no notion as to what it could have been none one more question how did your mother take the matter she was angry and said that i was never to speak of the matter again and your father did you tell him yes and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and that i should hear of hosmer again as he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine and yet what could have happened and why could he not write oh it drives me halfmad to think of it and i cant sleep a wink at night she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it i shall glance into the case for you said holmes rising and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further above all try to let mr hosmer angel vanish from your memory as he has done from your life then you dont think ill see him again i fear not then what has happened to him you will leave that question in my hands i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare i advertised for him in last saturdays _chronicle_ said she here is the slip and here are four letters from him thank you and your address no lyon place camberwell mr angels address you never had i understand where is your fathers place of business he travels for westhouse marbank the great claret importers of fenchurch street thank you you have made your statement very clearly you will leave the papers here and remember the advice which i have given you let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life you are very kind mr holmes but i cannot do that i shall be true to hosmer he shall find me ready when he comes back for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together his legs stretched out in front of him and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe which was to him as a counsellor and having lit it he leaned back in his chair with the thick blue cloudwreaths spinning up from him and a look of infinite languor in his face quite an interesting study that maiden he observed i found her more interesting than her little problem which by the way is rather a trite one you will find parallel cases if you consult my index in andover in and there was something of the sort at the hague last year old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me but the maiden herself was most instructive you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me i remarked not invisible but unnoticed watson you did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important i can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumbnails or the great issues that may hang from a bootlace now what did you gather from that womans appearance describe it well she had a slatecoloured broadbrimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments her dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger her boots i didnt observe she had small round hanging gold earrings and a general air of being fairly welltodo in a vulgar comfortable easygoing way sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully you have really done very well indeed it is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details my first glance is always at a womans sleeve in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser as you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces the double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined the sewingmachine of the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the broadest part as this was i then glanced at her face and observing the dint of a pincenez at either side of her nose i ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to surprise her it surprised me but surely it was obvious i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toecap and the other a plain one one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five and the other at the first third and fifth now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots halfbuttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry and what else i asked keenly interested as i always was by my friends incisive reasoning i noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep it must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger all this is amusing though rather elementary but i must go back to business watson would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr hosmer angel i held the little printed slip to the light missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth a gentleman named hosmer angel about five ft seven in in height strongly built sallow complexion black hair a little bald in the centre bushy black sidewhiskers and moustache tinted glasses slight infirmity of speech was dressed when last seen in black frockcoat faced with silk black waistcoat gold albert chain and grey harris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over elasticsided boots known to have been employed in an office in leadenhall street anybody bringing c c that will do said holmes as to the letters he continued glancing over them they are very commonplace absolutely no clue in them to mr angel save that he quotes balzac once there is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike you they are typewritten i remarked not only that but the signature is typewritten look at the neat little hosmer angel at the bottom there is a date you see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is rather vague the point about the signature is very suggestivein fact we may call it conclusive of what my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted no that was not the point however i shall write two letters which should settle the matter one is to a firm in the city the other is to the young ladys stepfather mr windibank asking him whether he could meet us here at six oclock tomorrow evening it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives and now doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim i had had so many reasons to believe in my friends subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom once only had i known him to fail in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph but when i looked back to the weird business of the sign of four and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the study in scarlet i felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel i left him then still puffing at his black clay pipe with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the sufferer it was not until close upon six oclock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of the little mystery i found sherlock holmes alone however half asleep with his long thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair a formidable array of bottles and testtubes with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him well have you solved it i asked as i entered yes it was the bisulphate of baryta no no the mystery i cried oh that i thought of the salt that i have been working upon there was never any mystery in the matter though as i said yesterday some of the details are of interest the only drawback is that there is no law i fear that can touch the scoundrel who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland the question was hardly out of my mouth and holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door this is the girls stepfather mr james windibank said holmes he has written to me to say that he would be here at six come in the man who entered was a sturdy middlesized fellow some thirty years of age cleanshaven and sallowskinned with a bland insinuating manner and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes he shot a questioning glance at each of us placed his shiny tophat upon the sideboard and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair goodevening mr james windibank said holmes i think that this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an appointment with me for six oclock yes sir i am afraid that i am a little late but i am not quite my own master you know i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public it was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point of course i did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel on the contrary said holmes quietly i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel mr windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves i am delighted to hear it he said it is a curious thing remarked holmes that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a mans handwriting unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike some letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one side now you remark in this note of yours mr windibank that in every case there is some little slurring over of the e and a slight defect in the tail of the r there are fourteen other characteristics but those are the more obvious we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office and no doubt it is a little worn our visitor answered glancing keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study mr windibank holmes continued i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention i have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man they are all typewritten in each case not only are the es slurred and the rs tailless but you will observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well mr windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk mr holmes he said if you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done it certainly said holmes stepping over and turning the key in the door i let you know then that i have caught him what where shouted mr windibank turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap oh it wont doreally it wont said holmes suavely there is no possible getting out of it mr windibank it is quite too transparent and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question thats right sit down and let us talk it over our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow itits not actionable he stammered i am very much afraid that it is not but between ourselves windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me now let me just run over the course of events and you will contradict me if i go wrong the man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his breast like one who is utterly crushed holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed than to us the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them it was a considerable sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have made a serious difference it was worth an effort to preserve it the daughter was of a good amiable disposition but affectionate and warmhearted in her ways so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages and her little income she would not be allowed to remain single long now her marriage would mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her stepfather do to prevent it he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age but soon he found that that would not answer forever she became restive insisted upon her rights and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball what does her clever stepfather do then he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the girls short sight he appears as mr hosmer angel and keeps off other lovers by making love himself it was only a joke at first groaned our visitor we never thought that she would have been so carried away very likely not however that may be the young lady was very decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind she was flattered by the gentlemans attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother then mr angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced there were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the girls affections from turning towards anyone else but the deception could not be kept up forever these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young ladys mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man as far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a fourwheeler and out at the other i think that was the chain of events mr windibank our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face it may be so or it may not mr holmes said he but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now and not me i have done nothing actionable from the first but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint the law cannot as you say touch you said holmes unlocking and throwing open the door yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more if the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders by jove he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the mans face it is not part of my duties to my client but heres a hunting crop handy and i think i shall just treat myself to he took two swift steps to the whip but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see mr james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road theres a coldblooded scoundrel said holmes laughing as he threw himself down into his chair once more that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows the case has in some respects been not entirely devoid of interest i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning i remarked well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could see was the stepfather then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it you see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction and how did you verify them having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration i knew the firm for which this man worked having taken the printed description i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguisethe whiskers the glasses the voice and i sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers i had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here as i expected his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects the same post brought me a letter from westhouse marbank of fenchurch street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employé james windibank _voilà tout_ and miss sutherland if i tell her she will not believe me you may remember the old persian saying there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much knowledge of the world iv the boscombe valley mystery we were seated at breakfast one morning my wife and i when the maid brought in a telegram it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way have you a couple of days to spare have just been wired for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy shall be glad if you will come with me air and scenery perfect leave paddington by the what do you say dear said my wife looking across at me will you go i really dont know what to say i have a fairly long list at present oh anstruther would do your work for you you have been looking a little pale lately i think that the change would do you good and you are always so interested in mr sherlock holmes cases i should be ungrateful if i were not seeing what i gained through one of them i answered but if i am to go i must pack at once for i have only half an hour my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller my wants were few and simple so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise rattling away to paddington station sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travellingcloak and closefitting cloth cap it is really very good of you to come watson said he it makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely local aid is always either worthless or else biassed if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him among these he rummaged and read with intervals of notetaking and of meditation until we were past reading then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack have you heard anything of the case he asked not a word i have not seen a paper for some days the london press has not had very full accounts i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars it seems from what i gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult that sounds a little paradoxical but it is profoundly true singularity is almost invariably a clue the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home in this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man it is a murder then well it is conjectured to be so i shall take nothing for granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it i will explain the state of things to you as far as i have been able to understand it in a very few words boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross in herefordshire the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr john turner who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to the old country one of the farms which he held that of hatherley was let to mr charles mccarthy who was also an exaustralian the men had known each other in the colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible turner was apparently the richer man so mccarthy became his tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect equality as they were frequently together mccarthy had one son a lad of eighteen and turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither of them had wives living they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the racemeetings of the neighbourhood mccarthy kept two servantsa man and a girl turner had a considerable household some halfdozen at the least that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families now for the facts on june rd that is on monday last mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley he had been out with his servingman in the morning at ross and he had told the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three from that appointment he never came back alive from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground one was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was william crowder a gamekeeper in the employ of mr turner both these witnesses depose that mr mccarthy was walking alone the gamekeeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr mccarthy pass he had seen his son mr james mccarthy going the same way with a gun under his arm to the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder the gamekeeper lost sight of them the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of the lodgekeeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the woods picking flowers she states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodgekeeper he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the buttend of his sons gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next assizes those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the policecourt i could hardly imagine a more damning case i remarked if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered holmes thoughtfully it may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different it must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit there are several people in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in his interest lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middleaged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home i am afraid said i that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answered laughing besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr lestrade you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding to take the first example to hand i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the righthand side and yet i question whether mr lestrade would have noted even so selfevident a thing as that how on earth my dear fellow i know you well i know the military neatness which characterises you you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference therein lies my _métier_ and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering what are they it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroners jury it was a confession i ejaculated no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark on the contrary said holmes it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable selfrestraint and firmness as to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him the selfreproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one i shook my head many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence i remarked so they have and many men have been wrongfully hanged what is the young mans own account of the matter it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive you will find it here and may read it for yourself he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully it ran in this way mr james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called and gave evidence as follows i had been away from home for three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday the rd my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was going i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side on my way i saw william crowder the gamekeeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father i had no idea that he was in front of me when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of cooee which was a usual signal between my father and myself i then hurried forward and found him standing by the pool he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable i left him and returned towards hatherley farm i had not gone more than yards however when i heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run back again i found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly injured i dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he almost instantly expired i knelt beside him for some minutes and then made my way to mr turners lodgekeeper his house being the nearest to ask for assistance i saw no one near my father when i returned and i have no idea how he came by his injuries he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far as i know no active enemies i know nothing further of the matter the coroner did your father make any statement to you before he died witness he mumbled a few words but i could only catch some allusion to a rat the coroner what did you understand by that witness it conveyed no meaning to me i thought that he was delirious the coroner what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel witness i should prefer not to answer the coroner i am afraid that i must press it witness it is really impossible for me to tell you i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed the coroner that is for the court to decide i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise witness i must still refuse the coroner i understand that the cry of cooee was a common signal between you and your father witness it was the coroner how was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol witness with considerable confusion i do not know a juryman did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured witness nothing definite the coroner what do you mean witness i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open that i could think of nothing except of my father yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me it seemed to me to be something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps when i rose from my father i looked round for it but it was gone do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help yes it was gone you cannot say what it was no i had a feeling something was there how far from the body a dozen yards or so and how far from the edge of the wood about the same then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it yes but with my back towards it this concluded the examination of the witness i see said i as i glanced down the column that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his fathers dying words they are all as he remarks very much against the son holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat both you and the coroner have been at some pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the young mans favour dont you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so _outré_ as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth no sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us and now here is my pocket petrarch and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes it was nearly four oclock when we at last after passing through the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleaming severn found ourselves at the pretty little countrytown of ross a lean ferretlike man furtive and slylooking was waiting for us upon the platform in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leatherleggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade of scotland yard with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us i have ordered a carriage said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea i knew your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered it is entirely a question of barometric pressure lestrade looked startled i do not quite follow he said how is the glass twentynine i see no wind and not a cloud in the sky i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage tonight lestrade laughed indulgently you have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers he said the case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes still of course one cant refuse a lady and such a very positive one too she has heard of you and would have your opinion though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done why bless my soul here is her carriage at the door he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern oh mr sherlock holmes she cried glancing from one to the other of us and finally with a womans quick intuition fastening upon my companion i am so glad that you have come i have driven down to tell you so i know that james didnt do it i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it too never let yourself doubt upon that point we have known each other since we were little children and i know his faults as no one else does but he is too tenderhearted to hurt a fly such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him i hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes you may rely upon my doing all that i can but you have read the evidence you have formed some conclusion do you not see some loophole some flaw do you not yourself think that he is innocent i think that it is very probable there now she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade you hear he gives me hopes lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said but he is right oh i know that he is right james never did it and about his quarrel with his father i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it in what way asked holmes it is no time for me to hide anything james and his father had many disagreements about me mr mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet andandwell he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet so there were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them and your father asked holmes was he in favour of such a union no he was averse to it also no one but mr mccarthy was in favour of it a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her thank you for this information said he may i see your father if i call tomorrow i am afraid the doctor wont allow it the doctor yes have you not heard poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely he has taken to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered mr mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria ha in victoria that is important yes at the mines quite so at the goldmines where as i understand mr turner made his money yes certainly thank you miss turner you have been of material assistance to me you will tell me if you have any news tomorrow no doubt you will go to the prison to see james oh if you do mr holmes do tell him that i know him to be innocent i will miss turner i must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if i leave him goodbye and god help you in your undertaking she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street i am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after a few minutes silence why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint i am not overtender of heart but i call it cruel i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy said holmes have you an order to see him in prison yes but only for you and me then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him tonight ample then let us do so watson i fear that you will find it very slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours i walked down to the station with them and then wandered through the streets of the little town finally returning to the hotel where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellowbacked novel the puny plot of the story was so thin however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping and i found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact that i at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day supposing that this unhappy young mans story were absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father and the moment when drawn back by his screams he rushed into the glade it was something terrible and deadly what could it be might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper which contained a verbatim account of the inquest in the surgeons deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon i marked the spot upon my own head clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind that was to some extent in favour of the accused as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father still it did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell still it might be worth while to call holmes attention to it then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat what could that mean it could not be delirium a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious no it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate but what could it indicate i cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation and then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy if that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was i did not wonder at lestrades opinion and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes insight that i could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthys innocence it was late before sherlock holmes returned he came back alone for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town the glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground on the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that and i did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey i have seen young mccarthy and what did you learn from him nothing could he throw no light none at all i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else he is not a very quickwitted youth though comely to look at and i should think sound at heart i cannot admire his taste i remarked if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss turner ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale this fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boardingschool what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office no one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss turner on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol and his father did not know where he was mark that point it is of importance good has come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered but if he is innocent who has done it ah who i would call your attention very particularly to two points one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry cooee before he knew that his son had returned those are the crucial points upon which the case depends and now let us talk about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until tomorrow there was no rain as holmes had foretold and the morning broke bright and cloudless at nine oclock lestrade called for us with the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool there is serious news this morning lestrade observed it is said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is despaired of an elderly man i presume said holmes about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time this business has had a very bad effect upon him he was an old friend of mccarthys and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free indeed that is interesting said holmes oh yes in a hundred other ways he has helped him everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him really does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to turner should still talk of marrying his son to turners daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow it is the more strange since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not deduce something from that we have got to the deductions and the inferences said lestrade winking at me i find it hard enough to tackle facts holmes without flying away after theories and fancies you are right said holmes demurely you do find it very hard to tackle the facts anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth and that is that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said holmes laughing but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left yes that is it it was a widespread comfortablelooking building twostoried slateroofed with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it we called at the door when the maid at holmes request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the sons though not the pair which he had then had having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes desired to be led to the courtyard from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him his face flushed and darkened his brows were drawn into two hard black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long sinewy neck his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool it was damp marshy ground as is all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow lestrade and i walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end the boscombe pool which is a little reedgirt sheet of water some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr turner above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowners dwelling on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man to holmes as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass he ran round like a dog who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion what did you go into the pool for he asked i fished about with a rake i thought there might be some weapon or other trace but how on earth oh tut tut i have no time that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place a mole could trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds oh how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it here is where the party with the lodgekeeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body but here are three separate tracks of the same feet he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to himself than to us these are young mccarthys feet twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible that bears out his story he ran when he saw his father on the ground then here are the fathers feet as he paced up and down what is this then it is the buttend of the gun as the son stood listening and this ha ha what have we here tiptoes tiptoes square too quite unusual boots they come they go they come againof course that was for the cloak now where did they come from he ran up and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction for a long time he remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach a jagged stone was lying among the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high road where all traces were lost it has been a case of considerable interest he remarked returning to his natural manner i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge i think that i will go in and have a word with moran and perhaps write a little note having done that we may drive back to our luncheon you may walk to the cab and i shall be with you presently it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into ross holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood this may interest you lestrade he remarked holding it out the murder was done with it i see no marks there are none how do you know then the grass was growing under it it had only lain there a few days there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken it corresponds with the injuries there is no sign of any other weapon and the murderer is a tall man lefthanded limps with the right leg wears thicksoled shootingboots and a grey cloak smokes indian cigars uses a cigarholder and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket there are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search lestrade laughed i am afraid that i am still a sceptic he said theories are all very well but we have to deal with a hardheaded british jury _nous verrons_ answered holmes calmly you work your own method and i shall work mine i shall be busy this afternoon and shall probably return to london by the evening train and leave your case unfinished no finished but the mystery it is solved who was the criminal then the gentleman i describe but who is he surely it would not be difficult to find out this is not such a populous neighbourhood lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am a practical man he said and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a lefthanded gentleman with a game leg i should become the laughingstock of scotland yard all right said holmes quietly i have given you the chance here are your lodgings goodbye i shall drop you a line before i leave having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the table holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds himself in a perplexing position look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little i dont know quite what to do and i should value your advice light a cigar and let me expound pray do so well now in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthys narrative which struck us both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him one was the fact that his father should according to his account cry cooee before seeing him the other was his singular dying reference to a rat he mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the sons ear now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true what of this cooee then well obviously it could not have been meant for the son the son as far as he knew was in bristol it was mere chance that he was within earshot the cooee was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with but cooee is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used between australians there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia what of the rat then sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table this is a map of the colony of victoria he said i wired to bristol for it last night he put his hand over part of the map what do you read arat i read and now he raised his hand ballarat quite so that was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables he was trying to utter the name of his murderer so and so of ballarat it is wonderful i exclaimed it is obvious and now you see i had narrowed the field down considerably the possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the sons statement to be correct was a certainty we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak certainly and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander quite so then comes our expedition of today by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal but how did you gain them you know my method it is founded upon the observation of trifles his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride his boots too might be told from their traces yes they were peculiar boots but his lameness the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left he put less weight upon it why because he limpedhe was lame but his lefthandedness you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side now how can that be unless it were by a lefthanded man he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son he had even smoked there i found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar i have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco having found the ash i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it it was an indian cigar of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam and the cigarholder i could see that the end had not been in his mouth therefore he used a holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt penknife holmes i said you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him i see the direction in which all this points the culprit is mr john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sittingroom and ushering in a visitor the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure his slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deeplined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character his tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue it was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently you had my note yes the lodgekeeper brought it up you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal i thought people would talk if i went to the hall and why did you wish to see me he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered yes said holmes answering the look rather than the words it is so i know all about mccarthy the old man sank his face in his hands god help me he cried but i would not have let the young man come to harm i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes i am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it would break her heartit will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested it may not come to that said holmes what i am no official agent i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests young mccarthy must be got off however i am a dying man said old turner i have had diabetes for years my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him just tell us the truth he said i shall jot down the facts you will sign it and watson here can witness it then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed its as well said the old man its a question whether i shall live to the assizes so it matters little to me but i should wish to spare alice the shock and now i will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell you didnt know this dead man mccarthy he was a devil incarnate i tell you that god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he his grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my life ill tell you first how i came to be in his power it was in the early s at the diggings i was a young chap then hotblooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at anything i got among bad companions took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber there were six of us and we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings black jack of ballarat was the name i went under and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attacked it there were six troopers and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley three of our boys were killed however before we got the swag i put my pistol to the head of the wagondriver who was this very man mccarthy i wish to the lord that i had shot him then but i spared him though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every feature we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to england without being suspected there i parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life i bought this estate which chanced to be in the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which i had earned it i married too and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done in a word i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me i had gone up to town about an investment and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot here we are jack says he touching me on the arm well be as good as a family to you theres two of us me and my son and you can have the keeping of us if you dontits a fine lawabiding country is england and theres always a policeman within hail well down they came to the west country there was no shaking them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since there was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness turn where i would there was his cunning grinning face at my elbow it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was i gave him without question land money houses until at last he asked a thing which i could not give he asked for alice his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i was known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property but there i was firm i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine not that i had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that was enough i stood firm mccarthy threatened i braved him to do his worst we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over when i went down there i found him talking with his son so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this could i not snap the bond i was already a dying and a desperate man though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb i knew that my own fate was sealed but my memory and my girl both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue i did it mr holmes i would do it again deeply as i have sinned i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than i could suffer i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast his cry brought back his son but i had gained the cover of the wood though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight that is the true story gentlemen of all that occurred well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation i pray not sir and what do you intend to do in view of your health nothing you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes i will keep your confession and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be forced to use it if not it shall never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us farewell then said the old man solemnly your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine tottering and shaking in all his giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room god help us said holmes after a long silence why does fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxters words and say there but for the grace of god goes sherlock holmes james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel old turner lived for seven months after our interview but he is now dead and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past v the five orange pips when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes cases between the years and i am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave some however have already gained publicity through the papers and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate some too have baffled his analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him there is however one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been and probably never will be entirely cleared up the year furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest of which i retain the records among my headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the british barque _sophy anderson_ of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa and finally of the camberwell poisoning case in the latter as may be remembered sherlock holmes was able by winding up the dead mans watch to prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that timea deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case all these i may sketch out at some future date but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe it was in the latter days of september and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that even here in the heart of great handmade london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like untamed beasts in a cage as evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace crossindexing his records of crime while i at the other was deep in one of clark russells fine seastories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves my wife was on a visit to her mothers and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street why said i glancing up at my companion that was surely the bell who could come tonight some friend of yours perhaps except yourself i have none he answered i do not encourage visitors a client then if so it is a serious case nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landladys sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door he stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit come in said he the man who entered was young some twoandtwenty at the outside wellgroomed and trimly clad with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come he looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and i could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety i owe you an apology he said raising his golden pincenez to his eyes i trust that i am not intruding i fear that i have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber give me your coat and umbrella said holmes they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently you have come up from the southwest i see yes from horsham that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive i have come for advice that is easily got and help that is not always so easy i have heard of you mr holmes i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal ah of course he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards he said that you could solve anything he said too much that you are never beaten i have been beaten four timesthree times by men and once by a woman but what is that compared with the number of your successes it is true that i have been generally successful then you may be so with me i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case it is no ordinary one none of those which come to me are i am the last court of appeal and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family you fill me with interest said holmes pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and i can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze my name said he is john openshaw but my own affairs have as far as i can understand little to do with this awful business it is a hereditary matter so in order to give you an idea of the facts i must go back to the commencement of the affair you must know that my grandfather had two sonsmy uncle elias and my father joseph my father had a small factory at coventry which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling he was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and became a planter in florida where he was reported to have done very well at the time of the war he fought in jacksons army and afterwards under hood where he rose to be a colonel when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where he remained for three or four years about or he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham he had made a very considerable fortune in the states and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them he was a singular man fierce and quicktempered very foulmouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring disposition during all the years that he lived at horsham i doubt if ever he set foot in the town he had a garden and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily but he would see no society and did not want any friends not even his own brother he didnt mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so this would be in the year after he had been eight or nine years in england he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house i kept all the keys and could go where i liked and do what i liked so long as i did not disturb him in his privacy there was one singular exception however for he had a single room a lumberroom up among the attics which was invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter with a boys curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room one dayit was in march a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonels plate it was not a common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all paid in ready money and he had no friends of any sort from india said he as he took it up pondicherry postmark what can this be opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate i began to laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face his lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand k k k he shrieked and then my god my god my sins have overtaken me what is it uncle i cried death said he and rising from the table he retired to his room leaving me palpitating with horror i took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter k three times repeated there was nothing else save the five dried pips what could be the reason of his overpowering terror i left the breakfasttable and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other they may do what they like but ill checkmate them still said he with an oath tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room today and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer i did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room the fire was burning brightly and in the grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned paper while the brass box stood open and empty beside it as i glanced at the box i noticed with a start that upon the lid was printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the envelope i wish you john said my uncle to witness my will i leave my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to you if you can enjoy it in peace well and good if you find you cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest enemy i am sorry to give you such a twoedged thing but i cant say what turn things are going to take kindly sign the paper where mr fordham shows you i signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with him the singular incident made as you may think the deepest impression upon me and i pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it yet i could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives i could see a change in my uncle however he drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil when these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul at such times i have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little greenscummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden there was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity brought in a verdict of suicide but i who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it the matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some which lay to his credit at the bank one moment holmes interposed your statement is i foresee one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide the letter arrived on march his death was seven weeks later upon the night of may nd thank you pray proceed when my father took over the horsham property he at my request made a careful examination of the attic which had been always locked up we found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed on the inside of the cover was a paper label with the initials of k k k repeated upon it and letters memoranda receipts and a register written beneath these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw for the rest there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and notebooks bearing upon my uncles life in america some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpetbag politicians who had been sent down from the north well it was the beginning of when my father came to live at horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the january of on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfasttable there he was sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one he had always laughed at what he called my cockandbull story about the colonel but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself why what on earth does this mean john he stammered my heart had turned to lead it is k k k said i he looked inside the envelope so it is he cried here are the very letters but what is this written above them put the papers on the sundial i read peeping over his shoulder what papers what sundial he asked the sundial in the garden there is no other said i but the papers must be those that are destroyed pooh said he gripping hard at his courage we are in a civilised land here and we cant have tomfoolery of this kind where does the thing come from from dundee i answered glancing at the postmark some preposterous practical joke said he what have i to do with sundials and papers i shall take no notice of such nonsense i should certainly speak to the police i said and be laughed at for my pains nothing of the sort then let me do so no i forbid you i wont have a fuss made about such nonsense it was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate man i went about however with a heart which was full of forebodings on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill i was glad that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home in that however i was in error upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major imploring me to come at once my father had fallen over one of the deep chalkpits which abound in the neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull i hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness he had as it appears been returning from fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him and the chalkpit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of death from accidental causes carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder there were no signs of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease and that i was wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him in this sinister way i came into my inheritance you will ask me why i did not dispose of it i answer because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncles life and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another it was in january that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then during that time i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended with the last generation i had begun to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips this is the envelope he continued the postmark is londoneastern division within are the very words which were upon my fathers last message k k k and then put the papers on the sundial what have you done asked holmes nothing nothing to tell the truthhe sank his face into his thin white handsi have felt helpless i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against tut tut cried sherlock holmes you must act man or you are lost nothing but energy can save you this is no time for despair i have seen the police ah but they listened to my story with a smile i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings holmes shook his clenched hands in the air incredible imbecility he cried they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me has he come with you tonight no his orders were to stay in the house again holmes raved in the air why did you come to me he said and above all why did you not come at once i did not know it was only today that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you it is really two days since you had the letter we should have acted before this you have no further evidence i suppose than that which you have placed before usno suggestive detail which might help us there is one thing said john openshaw he rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured bluetinted paper he laid it out upon the table i have some remembrance said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped destruction beyond the mention of pips i do not see that it helps us much i think myself that it is a page from some private diary the writing is undoubtedly my uncles holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book it was headed march and beneath were the following enigmatical notices th hudson came same old platform th set the pips on mccauley paramore and john swain of st augustine th mccauley cleared th john swain cleared th visited paramore all well thank you said holmes folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor and now you must on no account lose another instant we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me you must get home instantly and act what shall i do there is but one thing to do it must be done at once you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed do you understand entirely do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present i think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties i thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his overcoat you have given me fresh life and hope i shall certainly do as you advise do not lose an instant and above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger how do you go back by train from waterloo it is not yet nine the streets will be crowded so i trust that you may be in safety and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely i am armed that is well tomorrow i shall set to work upon your case i shall see you at horsham then no your secret lies in london it is there that i shall seek it then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the papers i shall take your advice in every particular he shook hands with us and took his leave outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows this strange wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elementsblown in upon us like a sheet of seaweed in a galeand now to have been reabsorbed by them once more sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire then he lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smokerings as they chased each other up to the ceiling i think watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this save perhaps the sign of four well yes save perhaps that and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos but have you i asked formed any definite conception as to what these perils are there can be no question as to their nature he answered then what are they who is this k k k and why does he pursue this unhappy family sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his fingertips together the ideal reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses to carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopædias is a somewhat rare accomplishment it is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeavoured in my case to do if i remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion yes i answered laughing it was a singular document philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i remember botany variable geology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violinplayer boxer swordsman lawyer and selfpoisoner by cocaine and tobacco those i think were the main points of my analysis holmes grinned at the last item well he said i say now as i said then that a man should keep his little brainattic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumberroom of his library where he can get it if he wants it now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us tonight we need certainly to muster all our resources kindly hand me down the letter k of the _american encyclopædia_ which stands upon the shelf beside you thank you now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it in the first place we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors did you remark the postmarks of those letters the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london from east london what do you deduce from that they are all seaports that the writer was on board of a ship excellent we have already a clue there can be no doubt that the probabilitythe strong probabilityis that the writer was on board of a ship and now let us consider another point in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days does that suggest anything a greater distance to travel but the letter had also a greater distance to come then i do not see the point there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailingship it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mailboat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer it is possible more than that it is probable and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to caution the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay good god i cried what can it mean this relentless persecution the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailingship i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroners jury there must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may in this way you see k k k ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society but of what society have you never said sherlock holmes bending forward and sinking his voicehave you never heard of the ku klux klan i never have holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee here it is said he presently ku klux klan a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle this terrible secret society was formed by some exconfederate soldiers in the southern states after the civil war and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country notably in tennessee louisiana the carolinas georgia and florida its power was used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shapea sprig of oakleaves in some parts melon seeds or orange pips in others on receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might fly from the country if he braved the matter out death would unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner so perfect was the organisation of the society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators for some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south eventually in the year the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date you will observe said holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers it may well have been cause and effect it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered then the page we have seen is such as we might expect it ran if i remember right sent the pips to a b and cthat is sent the societys warning to them then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or left the country and finally that c was visited with i fear a sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him there is nothing more to be said or to be done tonight so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men it had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down you will excuse me for not waiting for you said he i have i foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaws what steps will you take i asked it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries i may have to go down to horsham after all you will not go there first no i shall commence with the city just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee as i waited i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart holmes i cried you are too late ah said he laying down his cup i feared as much how was it done he spoke calmly but i could see that he was deeply moved my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading tragedy near waterloo bridge here is the account between nine and ten last night policeconstable cook of the h division on duty near waterloo bridge heard a cry for help and a splash in the water the night however was extremely dark and stormy so that in spite of the help of several passersby it was quite impossible to effect a rescue the alarm however was given and by the aid of the waterpolice the body was eventually recovered it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket was john openshaw and whose residence is near horsham it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landingplaces for river steamboats the body exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landingstages we sat in silence for some minutes holmes more depressed and shaken than i had ever seen him that hurts my pride watson he said at last it is a petty feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride it becomes a personal matter with me now and if god sends me health i shall set my hand upon this gang that he should come to me for help and that i should send him away to his death he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands they must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last how could they have decoyed him down there the embankment is not on the direct line to the station the bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night for their purpose well watson we shall see who will win in the long run i am going out now to the police no i shall be my own police when i have spun the web they may take the flies but not before all day i was engaged in my professional work and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street sherlock holmes had not come back yet it was nearly ten oclock before he entered looking pale and worn he walked up to the sideboard and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously washing it down with a long draught of water you are hungry i remarked starving it had escaped my memory i have had nothing since breakfast nothing not a bite i had no time to think of it and how have you succeeded well you have a clue i have them in the hollow of my hand young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged why watson let us put their own devilish trademark upon them it is well thought of what do you mean he took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope on the inside of the flap he wrote s h for j o then he sealed it and addressed it to captain james calhoun barque _lone star_ savannah georgia that will await him when he enters port said he chuckling it may give him a sleepless night he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him and who is this captain calhoun the leader of the gang i shall have the others but he first how did you trace it then he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with dates and names i have spent the whole day said he over lloyds registers and files of the old papers following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in there were thirtysix ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months of these one the _lone star_ instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union texas i think i was not and am not sure which but i knew that the ship must have an american origin what then i searched the dundee records and when i found that the barque _lone star_ was there in january my suspicion became a certainty i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london yes the _lone star_ had arrived here last week i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bound to savannah i wired to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight what will you do then oh i have my hand upon him he and the two mates are as i learn the only nativeborn americans in the ship the others are finns and germans i know also that they were all three away from the ship last night i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo by the time that their sailingship reaches savannah the mailboat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder there is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute as themselves was upon their track very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year we waited long for news of the _lone star_ of savannah but none ever reached us we did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shattered sternpost of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave with the letters l s carved upon it and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the _lone star_ vi the man with the twisted lip isa whitney brother of the late elias whitney dd principal of the theological college of st georges was much addicted to opium the habit grew upon him as i understand from some foolish freak when he was at college for having read de quinceys description of his dreams and sensations he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects he found as so many more have done that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives i can see him now with yellow pasty face drooping lids and pinpoint pupils all huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble man one nightit was in june there came a ring to my bell about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock i sat up in my chair and my wife laid her needlework down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment a patient said she youll have to go out i groaned for i was newly come back from a weary day we heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps upon the linoleum our own door flew open and a lady clad in some darkcoloured stuff with a black veil entered the room you will excuse my calling so late she began and then suddenly losing her selfcontrol she ran forward threw her arms about my wifes neck and sobbed upon her shoulder oh im in such trouble she cried i do so want a little help why said my wife pulling up her veil it is kate whitney how you startled me kate i had not an idea who you were when you came in i didnt know what to do so i came straight to you that was always the way folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse it was very sweet of you to come now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it or should you rather that i sent james off to bed oh no no i want the doctors advice and help too its about isa he has not been home for two days i am so frightened about him it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husbands trouble to me as a doctor to my wife as an old friend and school companion we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find did she know where her husband was was it possible that we could bring him back to her it seems that it was she had the surest information that of late he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day and he had come back twitching and shattered in the evening but now the spell had been upon him eightandforty hours and he lay there doubtless among the dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects there he was to be found she was sure of it at the bar of gold in upper swandam lane but what was she to do how could she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him there was the case and of course there was but one way out of it might i not escort her to this place and then as a second thought why should she come at all i was isa whitneys medical adviser and as such i had influence over him i could manage it better if i were alone i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery sittingroom behind me and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as it seemed to me at the time though the future only could show how strange it was to be but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge between a slopshop and a ginshop approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave i found the den of which i was in search ordering my cab to wait i passed down the steps worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet and by the light of a flickering oillamp above the door i found the latch and made my way into a long low room thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden berths like the forecastle of an emigrant ship through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there a dark lacklustre eye turned upon the newcomer out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes the most lay silent but some muttered to themselves and others talked together in a strange low monotonous voice their conversation coming in gushes and then suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal beside which on a threelegged wooden stool there sat a tall thin old man with his jaw resting upon his two fists and his elbows upon his knees staring into the fire as i entered a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug beckoning me to an empty berth thank you i have not come to stay said i there is a friend of mine here mr isa whitney and i wish to speak with him there was a movement and an exclamation from my right and peering through the gloom i saw whitney pale haggard and unkempt staring out at me my god its watson said he he was in a pitiable state of reaction with every nerve in a twitter i say watson what oclock is it nearly eleven of what day of friday june th good heavens i thought it was wednesday it is wednesday what dyou want to frighten a chap for he sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key i tell you that it is friday man your wife has been waiting this two days for you you should be ashamed of yourself so i am but youve got mixed watson for i have only been here a few hours three pipes four pipesi forget how many but ill go home with you i wouldnt frighten katepoor little kate give me your hand have you a cab yes i have one waiting then i shall go in it but i must owe something find what i owe watson i am all off colour i can do nothing for myself i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers holding my breath to keep out the vile stupefying fumes of the drug and looking about for the manager as i passed the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my skirt and a low voice whispered walk past me and then look back at me the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear i glanced down they could only have come from the old man at my side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very wrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers i took two steps forward and looked back it took all my selfcontrol to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment he had turned his back so that none could see him but i his form had filled out his wrinkles were gone the dull eyes had regained their fire and there sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise was none other than sherlock holmes he made a slight motion to me to approach him and instantly as he turned his face half round to the company once more subsided into a doddering looselipped senility holmes i whispered what on earth are you doing in this den as low as you can he answered i have excellent ears if you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you i have a cab outside then pray send him home in it you may safely trust him for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief i should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me if you will wait outside i shall be with you in five minutes it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes requests for they were always so exceedingly definite and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery i felt however that when whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished and for the rest i could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence in a few minutes i had written my note paid whitneys bill led him out to the cab and seen him driven through the darkness in a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes for two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot then glancing quickly round he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter i suppose watson said he that you imagine that i have added opiumsmoking to cocaine injections and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views i was certainly surprised to find you there but not more so than i to find you i came to find a friend and i to find an enemy an enemy yes one of my natural enemies or shall i say my natural prey briefly watson i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots as i have done before now had i been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hours purchase for i have used it before now for my own purposes and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me there is a trapdoor at the back of that building near the corner of pauls wharf which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights what you do not mean bodies ay bodies watson we should be rich men if we had for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den it is the vilest murdertrap on the whole riverside and i fear that neville st clair has entered it never to leave it more but our trap should be here he put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrillya signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses hoofs now watson said holmes as a tall dogcart dashed up through the gloom throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns youll come with me wont you if i can be of use oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a chronicler still more so my room at the cedars is a doublebedded one the cedars yes that is mr st clairs house i am staying there while i conduct the inquiry where is it then near lee in kent we have a sevenmile drive before us but i am all in the dark of course you are youll know all about it presently jump up here all right john we shall not need you heres half a crown look out for me tomorrow about eleven give her her head so long then he flicked the horse with his whip and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets which widened gradually until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall of the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his breast and the air of a man who is lost in thought while i sat beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts we had driven several miles and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas when he shook himself shrugged his shoulders and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best you have a grand gift of silence watson said he it makes you quite invaluable as a companion pon my word it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are not overpleasant i was wondering what i should say to this dear little woman tonight when she meets me at the door you forget that i know nothing about it i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee it seems absurdly simple and yet somehow i can get nothing to go upon theres plenty of thread no doubt but i cant get the end of it into my hand now ill state the case clearly and concisely to you watson and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me proceed then some years agoto be definite in may there came to lee a gentleman neville st clair by name who appeared to have plenty of money he took a large villa laid out the grounds very nicely and lived generally in good style by degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood and in he married the daughter of a local brewer by whom he now has two children he had no occupation but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning returning by the from cannon street every night mr st clair is now thirtyseven years of age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very affectionate father and a man who is popular with all who know him i may add that his whole debts at the present moment as far as we have been able to ascertain amount to _s_ while he has standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank there is no reason therefore to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind last monday mr neville st clair went into town rather earlier than usual remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks now by the merest chance his wife received a telegram upon this same monday very shortly after his departure to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company now if you are well up in your london you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street which branches out of upper swandam lane where you found me tonight mrs st clair had her lunch started for the city did some shopping proceeded to the companys office got her packet and found herself at exactly walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station have you followed me so far it is very clear if you remember monday was an exceedingly hot day and mrs st clair walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself while she was walking in this way down swandam lane she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning to her from a secondfloor window the window was open and she distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly agitated he waved his hands frantically to her and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town in he had on neither collar nor necktie convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the stepsfor the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me tonightand running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor at the foot of the stairs however she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken who thrust her back and aided by a dane who acts as assistant there pushed her out into the street filled with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the lane and by rare goodfortune met in fresno street a number of constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat the inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to the room in which mr st clair had last been seen there was no sign of him there in fact in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect who it seems made his home there both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered and had almost come to believe that mrs st clair had been deluded when with a cry she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it out there fell a cascade of childrens bricks it was the toy which he had promised to bring home this discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious the rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an abominable crime the front room was plainly furnished as a sittingroom and led into a small bedroom which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr neville st clair with the exception of his coat his boots his socks his hat and his watchall were there there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments and there were no other traces of mr neville st clair out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents but as by mrs st clairs story he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husbands appearance at the window he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime his defence was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone his lodger and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentlemans clothes so much for the lascar manager now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st clair his name is hugh boone and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city he is a professional beggar though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas some little distance down threadneedle street upon the lefthand side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the wall here it is that this creature takes his daily seat crosslegged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time his appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him a shock of orange hair a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passersby this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest but a cripple said i what could he have done singlehanded against a man in the prime of life he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and wellnurtured man surely your medical experience would tell you watson that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others pray continue your narrative mrs st clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window and she was escorted home in a cab by the police as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations inspector barton who had charge of the case made a very careful examination of the premises but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the lascar but this fault was soon remedied and he was seized and searched without anything being found which could incriminate him there were it is true some bloodstains upon his right shirtsleeve but he pointed to his ringfinger which had been cut near the nail and explained that the bleeding came from there adding that he had been to the window not long before and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source he denied strenuously having ever seen mr neville st clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police as to mrs st clairs assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming he was removed loudly protesting to the policestation while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue and it did though they hardly found upon the mudbank what they had feared to find it was neville st clairs coat and not neville st clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded and what do you think they found in the pockets i cannot imagine no i dont think you would guess every pocket stuffed with pennies and halfpennies pennies and halfpennies it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide but a human body is a different matter there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room would the body be dressed in a coat alone no sir but the facts might be met speciously enough suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st clair through the window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed what would he do then it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the telltale garments he would seize the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink he has little time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street there is not an instant to be lost he rushes to some secret hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coats sinking he throws it out and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared it certainly sounds feasible well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better boone as i have told you was arrested and taken to the station but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him he had for years been known as a professional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one there the matter stands at present and the questions which have to be solvedwhat neville st clair was doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is he now and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearanceare all as far from a solution as ever i confess that i cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us just as he finished however we drove through two scattered villages where a few lights still glimmered in the windows we are on the outskirts of lee said my companion we have touched on three english counties in our short drive starting in middlesex passing over an angle of surrey and ending in kent see that light among the trees that is the cedars and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already i have little doubt caught the clink of our horses feet but why are you not conducting the case from baker street i asked because there are many inquiries which must be made out here mrs st clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague i hate to meet her watson when i have no news of her husband here we are whoa there whoa we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds a stableboy had run out to the horses head and springing down i followed holmes up the small winding graveldrive which led to the house as we approached the door flew open and a little blonde woman stood in the opening clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light one hand upon the door one halfraised in her eagerness her body slightly bent her head and face protruded with eager eyes and parted lips a standing question well she cried well and then seeing that there were two of us she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders no good news none no bad no thank god for that but come in you must be weary for you have had a long day this is my friend dr watson he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation i am delighted to see you said she pressing my hand warmly you will i am sure forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us my dear madam said i i am an old campaigner and if i were not i can very well see that no apology is needed if i can be of any assistance either to you or to my friend here i shall be indeed happy now mr sherlock holmes said the lady as we entered a welllit diningroom upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions to which i beg that you will give a plain answer certainly madam do not trouble about my feelings i am not hysterical nor given to fainting i simply wish to hear your real real opinion upon what point in your heart of hearts do you think that neville is alive sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question frankly now she repeated standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basketchair frankly then madam i do not you think that he is dead i do murdered i dont say that perhaps and on what day did he meet his death on monday then perhaps mr holmes you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him today sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised what he roared yes today she stood smiling holding up a little slip of paper in the air may i see it certainly he snatched it from her in his eagerness and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently i had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder the envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day or rather of the day before for it was considerably after midnight coarse writing murmured holmes surely this is not your husbands writing madam no but the enclosure is i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address how can you tell that the name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried itself the rest is of the greyish colour which shows that blottingpaper has been used if it had been written straight off and then blotted none would be of a deep black shade this man has written the name and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not familiar with it it is of course a trifle but there is nothing so important as trifles let us now see the letter ha there has been an enclosure here yes there was a ring his signetring and you are sure that this is your husbands hand one of his hands one his hand when he wrote hurriedly it is very unlike his usual writing and yet i know it well dearest do not be frightened all will come well there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify wait in patienceneville written in pencil upon the flyleaf of a book octavo size no watermark hum posted today in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb ha and the flap has been gummed if i am not very much in error by a person who had been chewing tobacco and you have no doubt that it is your husbands hand madam none neville wrote those words and they were posted today at gravesend well mrs st clair the clouds lighten though i should not venture to say that the danger is over but he must be alive mr holmes unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent the ring after all proves nothing it may have been taken from him no no it is it is his very own writing very well it may however have been written on monday and only posted today that is possible if so much may have happened between oh you must not discourage me mr holmes i know that all is well with him there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet i in the diningroom rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened do you think that i would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view but if your husband is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away from you i cannot imagine it is unthinkable and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you no and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane very much so was the window open yes then he might have called to you he might he only as i understand gave an inarticulate cry yes a call for help you thought yes he waved his hands but it might have been a cry of surprise astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands it is possible and you thought he was pulled back he disappeared so suddenly he might have leaped back you did not see anyone else in the room no but this horrible man confessed to having been there and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs quite so your husband as far as you could see had his ordinary clothes on but without his collar or tie i distinctly saw his bare throat had he ever spoken of swandam lane never had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium never thank you mrs st clair those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear we shall now have a little supper and then retire for we may have a very busy day tomorrow a large and comfortable doublebedded room had been placed at our disposal and i was quickly between the sheets for i was weary after my night of adventure sherlock holmes was a man however who when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind would go for days and even for a week without rest turning it over rearranging his facts looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an allnight sitting he took off his coat and waistcoat put on a large blue dressinggown and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan upon which he perched himself crosslegged with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there an old briar pipe between his lips his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him silent motionless with the light shining upon his strongset aquiline features so he sat as i dropped off to sleep and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment the pipe was still between his lips the smoke still curled upward and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night awake watson he asked yes game for a morning drive certainly then dress no one is stirring yet but i know where the stableboy sleeps and we shall soon have the trap out he chuckled to himself as he spoke his eyes twinkled and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night as i dressed i glanced at my watch it was no wonder that no one was stirring it was twentyfive minutes past four i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse i want to test a little theory of mine said he pulling on his boots i think watson that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross but i think i have the key of the affair now and where is it i asked smiling in the bathroom he answered oh yes i am not joking he continued seeing my look of incredulity i have just been there and i have taken it out and i have got it in this gladstone bag come on my boy and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible and out into the bright morning sunshine in the road stood our horse and trap with the halfclad stableboy waiting at the head we both sprang in and away we dashed down the london road a few country carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to the metropolis but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream it has been in some points a singular case said holmes flicking the horse on into a gallop i confess that i have been as blind as a mole but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in bow street sherlock holmes was well known to the force and the two constables at the door saluted him one of them held the horses head while the other led us in who is on duty asked holmes inspector bradstreet sir ah bradstreet how are you a tall stout official had come down the stoneflagged passage in a peaked cap and frogged jacket i wish to have a quiet word with you bradstreet certainly mr holmes step into my room here it was a small officelike room with a huge ledger upon the table and a telephone projecting from the wall the inspector sat down at his desk what can i do for you mr holmes i called about that beggarman boonethe one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr neville st clair of lee yes he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries so i heard you have him here in the cells is he quiet oh he gives no trouble but he is a dirty scoundrel dirty yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his face is as black as a tinkers well when once his case has been settled he will have a regular prison bath and i think if you saw him you would agree with me that he needed it i should like to see him very much would you that is easily done come this way you can leave your bag no i think that ill take it very good come this way if you please he led us down a passage opened a barred door passed down a winding stair and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side the third on the right is his said the inspector here it is he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through he is asleep said he you can see him very well we both put our eyes to the grating the prisoner lay with his face towards us in a very deep sleep breathing slowly and heavily he was a middlesized man coarsely clad as became his calling with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat he was as the inspector had said extremely dirty but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness a broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead hes a beauty isnt he said the inspector he certainly needs a wash remarked holmes i had an idea that he might and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke and took out to my astonishment a very large bathsponge he he you are a funny one chuckled the inspector now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure well i dont know why not said the inspector he doesnt look a credit to the bow street cells does he he slipped his key into the lock and we all very quietly entered the cell the sleeper half turned and then settled down once more into a deep slumber holmes stooped to the waterjug moistened his sponge and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoners face let me introduce you he shouted to mr neville st clair of lee in the county of kent never in my life have i seen such a sight the mans face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree gone was the coarse brown tint gone too was the horrid scar which had seamed it across and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face a twitch brought away the tangled red hair and there sitting up in his bed was a pale sadfaced refinedlooking man blackhaired and smoothskinned rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing man i know him from the photograph the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny be it so said he and pray what am i charged with with making away with mr neville st oh come you cant be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it said the inspector with a grin well i have been twentyseven years in the force but this really takes the cake if i am mr neville st clair then it is obvious that no crime has been committed and that therefore i am illegally detained no crime but a very great error has been committed said holmes you would have done better to have trusted your wife it was not the wife it was the children groaned the prisoner god help me i would not have them ashamed of their father my god what an exposure what can i do sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up said he of course you can hardly avoid publicity on the other hand if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you i do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers inspector bradstreet would i am sure make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities the case would then never go into court at all god bless you cried the prisoner passionately i would have endured imprisonment ay even execution rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children you are the first who have ever heard my story my father was a schoolmaster in chesterfield where i received an excellent education i travelled in my youth took to the stage and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london one day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis and i volunteered to supply them there was the point from which all my adventures started it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to base my articles when an actor i had of course learned all the secrets of making up and had been famous in the greenroom for my skill i took advantage now of my attainments i painted my face and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of fleshcoloured plaster then with a red head of hair and an appropriate dress i took my station in the business part of the city ostensibly as a matchseller but really as a beggar for seven hours i plied my trade and when i returned home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than _s_ _d_ i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until some time later i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for i was at my wits end where to get the money but a sudden idea came to me i begged a fortnights grace from the creditor asked for a holiday from my employers and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise in ten days i had the money and had paid the debt well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint laying my cap on the ground and sitting still it was a long fight between my pride and the money but the dollars won at last and i threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers only one man knew my secret he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a welldressed man about town this fellow a lascar was well paid by me for his rooms so that i knew that my secret was safe in his possession well very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn a yearwhich is less than my average takingsbut i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up and also in a facility of repartee which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city all day a stream of pennies varied by silver poured in upon me and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take as i grew richer i grew more ambitious took a house in the country and eventually married without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation my dear wife knew that i had business in the city she little knew what last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the street with her eyes fixed full upon me i gave a cry of surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my confidant the lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me i heard her voice downstairs but i knew that she could not ascend swiftly i threw off my clothes pulled on those of a beggar and put on my pigments and wig even a wifes eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise but then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room and that the clothes might betray me i threw open the window reopening by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning then i seized my coat which was weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which i carried my takings i hurled it out of the window and it disappeared into the thames the other clothes would have followed but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair and a few minutes after i found rather i confess to my relief that instead of being identified as mr neville st clair i was arrested as his murderer i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and hence my preference for a dirty face knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me together with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to fear that note only reached her yesterday said holmes good god what a week she must have spent the police have watched this lascar said inspector bradstreet and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his who forgot all about it for some days that was it said holmes nodding approvingly i have no doubt of it but have you never been prosecuted for begging many times but what was a fine to me it must stop here however said bradstreet if the police are to hush this thing up there must be no more of hugh boone i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken but if you are found again then all must come out i am sure mr holmes that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up i wish i knew how you reach your results i reached this one said my friend by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag i think watson that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast vii the adventure of the blue carbuncle i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second morning after christmas with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressinggown a piperack within his reach upon the right and a pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly studied near at hand beside the couch was a wooden chair and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hardfelt hat much the worse for wear and cracked in several places a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination you are engaged said i perhaps i interrupt you not at all i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results the matter is a perfectly trivial onehe jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hatbut there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows were thick with the ice crystals i suppose i remarked that homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to itthat it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime no no no crime said sherlock holmes laughing only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal we have already had experience of such so much so i remarked that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes three have been entirely free of any legal crime precisely you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler papers to the singular case of miss mary sutherland and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip well i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category you know peterson the commissionaire yes it is to him that this trophy belongs it is his hat no no he found it its owner is unknown i beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem and first as to how it came here it arrived upon christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is i have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of petersons fire the facts are these about four oclock on christmas morning peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road in front of him he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder as he reached the corner of goodge street a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs one of the latter knocked off the mans hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an officiallooking person in uniform rushing towards him dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose which surely he restored to their owner my dear fellow there lies the problem it is true that for mrs henry baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to the birds left leg and it is also true that the initials h b are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them what then did peterson do he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay its finder has carried it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner did he not advertise no then what clue could you have as to his identity only as much as we can deduce from his hat precisely but you are joking what can you gather from this old battered felt here is my lens you know my methods what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape hard and much the worse for wear the lining had been of red silk but was a good deal discoloured there was no makers name but as holmes had remarked the initials h b were scrawled upon one side it was pierced in the brim for a hatsecurer but the elastic was missing for the rest it was cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink i can see nothing said i handing it back to my friend on the contrary watson you can see everything you fail however to reason from what you see you are too timid in drawing your inferences then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly welltodo within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days he had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him my dear holmes he has however retained some degree of selfrespect he continued disregarding my remonstrance he is a man who leads a sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is middleaged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days and which he anoints with limecream these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat also by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house you are certainly joking holmes not in the least is it possible that even now when i give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained i have no doubt that i am very stupid but i must confess that i am unable to follow you for example how did you deduce that this man was intellectual for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose it is a question of cubic capacity said he a man with so large a brain must have something in it the decline of his fortunes then this hat is three years old these flat brims curled at the edge came in then it is a hat of the very best quality look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world well that is clear enough certainly but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression sherlock holmes laughed here is the foresight said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hatsecurer they are never sold upon hats if this man ordered one it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature on the other hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his selfrespect your reasoning is certainly plausible the further points that he is middleaged that his hair is grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses limecream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining the lens discloses a large number of hairends clean cut by the scissors of the barber they all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of limecream this dust you will observe is not the gritty grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in the best of training but his wifeyou said that she had ceased to love him this hat has not been brushed for weeks when i see you my dear watson with a weeks accumulation of dust upon your hat and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wifes affection but he might be a bachelor nay he was bringing home the goose as a peaceoffering to his wife remember the card upon the birds leg you have an answer to everything but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house one tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when i see no less than five i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallowwalks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other anyhow he never got tallowstains from a gasjet are you satisfied well it is very ingenious said i laughing but since as you said just now there has been no crime committed and no harm done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a waste of energy sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew open and peterson the commissionaire rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment the goose mr holmes the goose sir he gasped eh what of it then has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the mans excited face see here sir see what my wife found in its crop he held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone rather smaller than a bean in size but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle by jove peterson said he this is treasure trove indeed i suppose you know what you have got a diamond sir a precious stone it cuts into glass as though it were putty its more than a precious stone it is _the_ precious stone not the countess of morcars blue carbuncle i ejaculated precisely so i ought to know its size and shape seeing that i have read the advertisement about it in _the times_ every day lately it is absolutely unique and its value can only be conjectured but the reward offered of is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price a thousand pounds great lord of mercy the commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us that is the reward and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem it was lost if i remember aright at the hotel cosmopolitan i remarked precisely so on december nd just five days ago john horner a plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the ladys jewelcase the evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes i have some account of the matter here i believe he rummaged amid his newspapers glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out doubled it over and read the following paragraph hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery john horner plumber was brought up upon the charge of having upon the nd inst abstracted from the jewelcase of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle james ryder upperattendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dressingroom of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate which was loose he had remained with horner some little time but had finally been called away on returning he found that horner had disappeared that the bureau had been forced open and that the small morocco casket in which as it afterwards transpired the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the dressingtable ryder instantly gave the alarm and horner was arrested the same evening but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms catherine cusack maid to the countess deposed to having heard ryders cry of dismay on discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room where she found matters as described by the last witness inspector bradstreet b division gave evidence as to the arrest of horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence in the strongest terms evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to the assizes horner who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court hum so much for the policecourt said holmes thoughtfully tossing aside the paper the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewelcase at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other you see watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect here is the stone the stone came from the goose and the goose came from mr henry baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which i have bored you so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery to do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers if this fail i shall have recourse to other methods what will you say give me a pencil and that slip of paper now then found at the corner of goodge street a goose and a black felt hat mr henry baker can have the same by applying at this evening at b baker street that is clear and concise very but will he see it well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it here you are peterson run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers in which sir oh in the _globe_ _star_ _pall mall_ _st jamess gazette_ _evening news_ _standard_ _echo_ and any others that occur to you very well sir and this stone ah yes i shall keep the stone thank you and i say peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring when the commissionaire had gone holmes took up the stone and held it against the light its a bonny thing said he just see how it glints and sparkles of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime every good stone is they are the devils pet baits in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed this stone is not yet twenty years old it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red in spite of its youth it has already a sinister history there have been two murders a vitriolthrowing a suicide and several robberies brought about for the sake of this fortygrain weight of crystallised charcoal who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison ill lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it do you think that this man horner is innocent i cannot tell well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had anything to do with the matter it is i think much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold that however i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement and you can do nothing until then nothing in that case i shall continue my professional round but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business very glad to see you i dine at seven there is a woodcock i believe by the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps i ought to ask mrs hudson to examine its crop i had been delayed at a case and it was a little after halfpast six when i found myself in baker street once more as i approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight just as i arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to holmes room mr henry baker i believe said he rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume pray take this chair by the fire mr baker it is a cold night and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter ah watson you have just come at the right time is that your hat mr baker yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat he was a large man with rounded shoulders a massive head and a broad intelligent face sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown a touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight tremor of his extended hand recalled holmes surmise as to his habits his rusty black frockcoat was buttoned right up in front with the collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt he spoke in a slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had illusage at the hands of fortune we have retained these things for some days said holmes because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them very naturally by the way about the bird we were compelled to eat it to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally well oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with a sigh of relief of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish the man burst into a hearty laugh they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure said he but beyond that i can hardly see what use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be to me no sir i think that with your permission i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders there is your hat then and there your bird said he by the way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from i am somewhat of a fowl fancier and i have seldom seen a better grown goose certainly sir said baker who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm there are a few of us who frequent the alpha inn near the museumwe are to be found in the museum itself during the day you understand this year our good host windigate by name instituted a goose club by which on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to receive a bird at christmas my pence were duly paid and the rest is familiar to you i am much indebted to you sir for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way so much for mr henry baker said holmes when he had closed the door behind him it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter are you hungry watson not particularly then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot by all means it was a bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats outside the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky and the breath of the passersby blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors quarter wimpole street harley street and so through wigmore street into oxford street in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at the alpha inn which is a small publichouse at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into holborn holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddyfaced whiteaproned landlord your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese said he my geese the man seemed surprised yes i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr henry baker who was a member of your goose club ah yes i see but you see sir thems not _our_ geese indeed whose then well i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden indeed i know some of them which was it breckinridge is his name ah i dont know him well heres your good health landlord and prosperity to your house goodnight now for mr breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air remember watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence it is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police and which a singular chance has placed in our hands let us follow it out to the bitter end faces to the south then and quick march we passed across holborn down endell street and so through a zigzag of slums to covent garden market one of the largest stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it and the proprietor a horseylooking man with a sharp face and trim sidewhiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters goodevening its a cold night said holmes the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion sold out of geese i see continued holmes pointing at the bare slabs of marble let you have five hundred tomorrow morning thats no good well there are some on the stall with the gasflare ah but i was recommended to you who by the landlord of the alpha oh yes i sent him a couple of dozen fine birds they were too now where did you get them from to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman now then mister said he with his head cocked and his arms akimbo what are you driving at lets have it straight now it is straight enough i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the alpha well then i shant tell you so now oh it is a matter of no importance but i dont know why you should be so warm over such a trifle warm youd be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as i am when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business but its where are the geese and who did you sell the geese to and what will you take for the geese one would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the fuss that is made over them well i have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries said holmes carelessly if you wont tell us the bet is off that is all but im always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls and i have a fiver on it that the bird i ate is country bred well then youve lost your fiver for its town bred snapped the salesman its nothing of the kind i say it is i dont believe it dyou think you know more about fowls than i who have handled them ever since i was a nipper i tell you all those birds that went to the alpha were town bred youll never persuade me to believe that will you bet then its merely taking your money for i know that i am right but ill have a sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be obstinate the salesman chuckled grimly bring me the books bill said he the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasybacked one laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp now then mr cocksure said the salesman i thought that i was out of geese but before i finish youll find that there is still one left in my shop you see this little book well thats the list of the folk from whom i buy dyou see well then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger now then you see this other page in red ink well that is a list of my town suppliers now look at that third name just read it out to me mrs oakshott brixton road read holmes quite so now turn that up in the ledger holmes turned to the page indicated here you are mrs oakshott brixton road egg and poultry supplier now then whats the last entry december nd twentyfour geese at _s_ _d_ quite so there you are and underneath sold to mr windigate of the alpha at _s_ what have you to say now sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined he drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words a few yards off he stopped under a lamppost and laughed in the hearty noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the pink un protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by a bet said he i daresay that if i had put down in front of him that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager well watson we are i fancy nearing the end of our quest and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this mrs oakshott tonight or whether we should reserve it for tomorrow it is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter and i should his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left turning round we saw a little ratfaced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while breckinridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure ive had enough of you and your geese he shouted i wish you were all at the devil together if you come pestering me any more with your silly talk ill set the dog at you you bring mrs oakshott here and ill answer her but what have you to do with it did i buy the geese off you no but one of them was mine all the same whined the little man well then ask mrs oakshott for it she told me to ask you well you can ask the king of proosia for all i care ive had enough of it get out of this he rushed fiercely forward and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness ha this may save us a visit to brixton road whispered holmes come with me and we will see what is to be made of this fellow striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder he sprang round and i could see in the gaslight that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face who are you then what do you want he asked in a quavering voice you will excuse me said holmes blandly but i could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now i think that i could be of assistance to you you who are you how could you know anything of the matter my name is sherlock holmes it is my business to know what other people dont know but you can know nothing of this excuse me i know everything of it you are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by mrs oakshott of brixton road to a salesman named breckinridge by him in turn to mr windigate of the alpha and by him to his club of which mr henry baker is a member oh sir you are the very man whom i have longed to meet cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter sherlock holmes hailed a fourwheeler which was passing in that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this windswept marketplace said he but pray tell me before we go farther who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting the man hesitated for an instant my name is john robinson he answered with a sidelong glance no no the real name said holmes sweetly it is always awkward doing business with an alias a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger well then said he my real name is james ryder precisely so head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan pray step into the cab and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with halffrightened halfhopeful eyes as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe then he stepped into the cab and in half an hour we were back in the sittingroom at baker street nothing had been said during our drive but the high thin breathing of our new companion and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous tension within him here we are said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room the fire looks very seasonable in this weather you look cold mr ryder pray take the basketchair i will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours now then you want to know what became of those geese yes sir or rather i fancy of that goose it was one bird i imagine in which you were interestedwhite with a black bar across the tail ryder quivered with emotion oh sir he cried can you tell me where it went to it came here here yes and a most remarkable bird it proved i dont wonder that you should take an interest in it it laid an egg after it was deadthe bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen i have it here in my museum our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand holmes unlocked his strongbox and held up the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold brilliant manypointed radiance ryder stood glaring with a drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it the games up ryder said holmes quietly hold up man or youll be into the fire give him an arm back into his chair watson hes not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity give him a dash of brandy so now he looks a little more human what a shrimp it is to be sure for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser i have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which i could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the countess of morcars it was catherine cusack who told me of it said he in a crackling voice i seeher ladyships waitingmaid well the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used it seems to me ryder that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you you knew that this man horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him what did you do then you made some small job in my ladys roomyou and your confederate cusackand you managed that he should be the man sent for then when he had left you rifled the jewelcase raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested you then ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companions knees for gods sake have mercy he shrieked think of my father of my mother it would break their hearts i never went wrong before i never will again i swear it ill swear it on a bible oh dont bring it into court for christs sake dont get back into your chair said holmes sternly it is very well to cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing i will fly mr holmes i will leave the country sir then the charge against him will break down hum we will talk about that and now let us hear a true account of the next act how came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market tell us the truth for there lies your only hope of safety ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips i will tell you it just as it happened sir said he when horner had been arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once for i did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe i went out as if on some commission and i made for my sisters house she had married a man named oakshott and lived in brixton road where she fattened fowls for the market all the way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective and for all that it was a cold night the sweat was pouring down my face before i came to the brixton road my sister asked me what was the matter and why i was so pale but i told her that i had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel then i went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do i had a friend once called maudsley who went to the bad and has just been serving his time in pentonville one day he had met me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what they stole i knew that he would be true to me for i knew one or two things about him so i made up my mind to go right on to kilburn where he lived and take him into my confidence he would show me how to turn the stone into money but how to get to him in safety i thought of the agonies i had gone through in coming from the hotel i might at any moment be seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket i was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the best detective that ever lived my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present and i knew that she was always as good as her word i would take my goose now and in it i would carry my stone to kilburn there was a little shed in the yard and behind this i drove one of the birdsa fine big one white with a barred tail i caught it and prying its bill open i thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach the bird gave a gulp and i felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop but the creature flapped and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the matter as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others whatever were you doing with that bird jem says she well said i you said youd give me one for christmas and i was feeling which was the fattest oh says she weve set yours aside for youjems bird we call it its the big white one over yonder theres twentysix of them which makes one for you and one for us and two dozen for the market thank you maggie says i but if it is all the same to you id rather have that one i was handling just now the other is a good three pound heavier said she and we fattened it expressly for you never mind ill have the other and ill take it now said i oh just as you like said she a little huffed which is it you want then that white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the flock oh very well kill it and take it with you well i did what she said mr holmes and i carried the bird all the way to kilburn i told my pal what i had done for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to he laughed until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose my heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred i left the bird rushed back to my sisters and hurried into the back yard there was not a bird to be seen there where are they all maggie i cried gone to the dealers jem which dealers breckinridge of covent garden but was there another with a barred tail i asked the same as the one i chose yes jem there were two barredtailed ones and i could never tell them apart well then of course i saw it all and i ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge but he had sold the lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone you heard him yourselves tonight well he has always answered me like that my sister thinks that i am going mad sometimes i think that i am myself and nowand now i am myself a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character god help me god help me he burst into convulsive sobbing with his face buried in his hands there was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes fingertips upon the edge of the table then my friend rose and threw open the door get out said he what sir oh heaven bless you no more words get out and no more words were needed there was a rush a clatter upon the stairs the bang of a door and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street after all watson said holmes reaching up his hand for his clay pipe i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies if horner were in danger it would be another thing but this fellow will not appear against him and the case must collapse i suppose that i am commuting a felony but it is just possible that i am saving a soul this fellow will not go wrong again he is too terribly frightened send him to gaol now and you make him a gaolbird for life besides it is the season of forgiveness chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward if you will have the goodness to touch the bell doctor we will begin another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief feature viii the adventure of the speckled band on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic of all these varied cases however i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the wellknown surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street it is possible that i might have placed them upon record before but a promise of secrecy was made at the time from which i have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given it is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for i have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of dr grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth it was early in april in the year that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my bed he was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarterpast seven i blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little resentment for i was myself regular in my habits very sorry to knock you up watson said he but its the common lot this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and i on you what is it thena fire no a client it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she is waiting now in the sittingroom now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate should it prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to follow it from the outset i thought at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations and in admiring the rapid deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him i rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sittingroom a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in the window rose as we entered goodmorning madam said holmes cheerily my name is sherlock holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ha i am glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the fire pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee for i observe that you are shivering it is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in a low voice changing her seat as requested what then it is fear mr holmes it is terror she raised her veil as she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick allcomprehensive glances you must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and patting her forearm we shall soon set matters right i have no doubt you have come in by train this morning i see you know me then no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dogcart along heavy roads before you reached the station the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion there is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save a dogcart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the lefthand side of the driver whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said she i started from home before six reached leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo sir i can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues i have no one to turn tonone save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid i have heard of you mr holmes i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that i had your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small casebook which he consulted farintosh said he ah yes i recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara i think it was before your time watson i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend as to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter alas replied our visitor the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman he does not say so but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes but i have heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me i am all attention madam my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey holmes nodded his head the name is familiar to me said he the family was at one time among the richest in england and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north and hampshire in the west in the last century however four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency nothing was left save a few acres of ground and the twohundredyearold house which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage the last squire dragged out his existence there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions obtained an advance from a relative which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta where by his professional skill and his force of character he established a large practice in a fit of anger however caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence as it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man when dr roylott was in india he married my mother mrs stoner the young widow of majorgeneral stoner of the bengal artillery my sister julia and i were twins and we were only two years old at the time of my mothers remarriage she had a considerable sum of moneynot less than a yearand this she bequeathed to dr roylott entirely while we resided with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage shortly after our return to england my mother diedshe was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe dr roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family and in my stepfathers case it had i believe been intensified by his long residence in the tropics a series of disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the policecourt until at last he became the terror of the village and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramblecovered land which represent the family estate and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end he has a passion also for indian animals which are sent over to him by a correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house she was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has your sister is dead then she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position we had however an aunt my mothers maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this ladys house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a halfpay major of marines to whom she became engaged my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor pray be precise as to details said he it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory the manorhouse is as i have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sittingrooms being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms the first is dr roylotts the second my sisters and the third my own there is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor do i make myself plain perfectly so the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn that fatal night dr roylott had gone to his room early though we knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke she left her room therefore and came into mine where she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding at eleven oclock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night never said i i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep certainly not but why because during the last few nights i have always about three in the morning heard a low clear whistle i am a light sleeper and it has awakened me i cannot tell where it came fromperhaps from the next room perhaps from the lawn i thought that i would just ask you whether you had heard it no i have not it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation very likely and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that you did not hear it also ah but i sleep more heavily than you well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock indeed said holmes was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night always and why i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked quite so pray proceed with your statement i could not sleep that night a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied it was a wild night the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman i knew that it was my sisters voice i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen as i ran down the passage my sisters door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges i stared at it horrorstricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by the light of the corridorlamp i saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed at first i thought that she had not recognised me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was the band the speckled band there was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctors room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressinggown when he reached my sisters side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister one moment said holmes are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound could you swear to it that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived was your sister dressed no she was in her nightdress in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a matchbox showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did the coroner come to he investigated the case with great care for dr roylotts conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by oldfashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end besides there were no marks of any violence upon her how about poison the doctors examined her for it but without success what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine were there gipsies in the plantation at the time yes there are nearly always some there ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a banda speckled band sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied these are very deep waters said he pray go on with your narrative two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage his name is armitagepercy armitagethe second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down got a dogcart at the crown inn which is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice you have done wisely said my friend but have you told me all yes all miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather why what do you mean for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitors knee five little livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed upon the white wrist you have been cruelly used said holmes the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist he is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength there was a long silence during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire this is a very deep business he said at last there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action yet we have not a moment to lose if we were to come to stoke moran today would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather as it happens he spoke of coming into town today upon some most important business it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way excellent you are not averse to this trip watson by no means then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town but i shall return by the twelve oclock train so as to be there in time for your coming and you may expect us early in the afternoon i have myself some small business matters to attend to will you not wait and breakfast no i must go my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room and what do you think of it all watson asked sherlock holmes leaning back in his chair it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business dark enough and sinister enough yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman i cannot think when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines but what then did the gipsies do i cannot imagine i see many objections to any such theory and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of the devil the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having a black tophat a long frockcoat and a pair of high gaiters with a huntingcrop swinging in his hand so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side a large face seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other of us while his deepset bileshot eyes and his high thin fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey which of you is holmes asked this apparition my name sir but you have the advantage of me said my companion quietly i am dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran indeed doctor said holmes blandly pray take a seat i will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here i have traced her what has she been saying to you it is a little cold for the time of the year said holmes what has she been saying to you screamed the old man furiously but i have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my companion imperturbably ha you put me off do you said our new visitor taking a step forward and shaking his huntingcrop i know you you scoundrel i have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler my friend smiled holmes the busybody his smile broadened holmes the scotland yard jackinoffice holmes chuckled heartily your conversation is most entertaining said he when you go out close the door for there is a decided draught i will go when i have had my say dont you dare to meddle with my affairs i know that miss stoner has been here i traced her i am a dangerous man to fall foul of see here he stepped swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room he seems a very amiable person said holmes laughing i am not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own as he spoke he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort straightened it out again fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter it was nearly one oclock when sherlock holmes returned from his excursion he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled over with notes and figures i have seen the will of the deceased wife said he to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned the total income which at the time of the wifes death was little short of is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than each daughter can claim an income of in case of marriage it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent my mornings work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket an eleys no is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots that and a toothbrush are i think all that we need at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes it was a perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged my companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought suddenly however he started tapped me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows look there said he a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope thickening into a grove at the highest point from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high rooftree of a very old mansion stoke moran said he yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked the driver there is some building going on there said holmes that is where we are going theres the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the house youll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the footpath over the fields there it is where the lady is walking and the lady i fancy is miss stoner observed holmes shading his eyes yes i think we had better do as you suggest we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead i thought it as well said holmes as we climbed the stile that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business it may stop his gossip goodafternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as our word our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy i have been waiting so eagerly for you she cried shaking hands with us warmly all has turned out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening we have had the pleasure of making the doctors acquaintance said holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened good heavens she cried he has followed me then so it appears he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him what will he say when he returns he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself up from him tonight if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunts at harrow now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine the building was of grey lichenblotched stone with a high central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab thrown out on each side in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin the central portion was in little better repair but the righthand block was comparatively modern and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the stonework had been broken into but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit holmes walked slowly up and down the illtrimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main building to dr roylotts chamber exactly so but i am now sleeping in the middle one pending the alterations as i understand by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall there were none i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there are windows in it of course yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass through as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive masonry hum said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened holmes refused to examine the third chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her fate it was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old countryhouses a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow whitecounterpaned bed in another and a dressingtable on the lefthand side of the window these articles with two small wickerwork chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown wormeaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment where does that bell communicate with he asked at last pointing to a thick bellrope which hung down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon the pillow it goes to the housekeepers room it looks newer than the other things yes it was only put there a couple of years ago your sister asked for it i suppose no i never heard of her using it we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bellpull there you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining minutely the cracks between the boards then he did the same with the woodwork with which the chamber was panelled finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall finally he took the bellrope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug why its a dummy said he wont it ring no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is how very absurd i never noticed that before very strange muttered holmes pulling at the rope there are one or two very singular points about this room for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air that is also quite modern said the lady done about the same time as the bellrope remarked holmes yes there were several little changes carried out about that time they seem to have been of a most interesting characterdummy bellropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment dr grimesby roylotts chamber was larger than that of his stepdaughter but was as plainly furnished a campbed a small wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest whats in here he asked tapping the safe my stepfathers business papers oh you have seen inside then only once some years ago i remember that it was full of papers there isnt a cat in it for example no what a strange idea well look at this he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it no we dont keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay there is one point which i should wish to determine he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention thank you that is quite settled said he rising and putting his lens in his pocket hullo here is something interesting the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed the lash however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord what do you make of that watson its a common enough lash but i dont know why it should be tied that is not quite so common is it ah me its a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn i had never seen my friends face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation we had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie it is very essential miss stoner said he that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect i shall most certainly do so the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may depend upon your compliance i assure you that i am in your hands in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment yes it must be so let me explain i believe that that is the village inn over there yes that is the crown very good your windows would be visible from there certainly you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night oh yes easily the rest you will leave in our hands but what will you do we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind said miss stoner laying her hand upon my companions sleeve perhaps i have then for pitys sake tell me what was the cause of my sisters death i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright no i do not think so i think that there was probably some more tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain goodbye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sittingroom at the crown inn they were on the upper floor and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house at dusk we saw dr grimesby roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctors voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him the trap drove on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sittingrooms do you know watson said holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness i have really some scruples as to taking you tonight there is a distinct element of danger can i be of assistance your presence might be invaluable then i shall certainly come it is very kind of you you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more i imagine that you saw all that i did i saw nothing remarkable save the bellrope and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine you saw the ventilator too yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran my dear holmes oh yes i did you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr roylotts cigar now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms it could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroners inquiry i deduced a ventilator but what harm can there be in that well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies does not that strike you i cannot as yet see any connection did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed no it was clamped to the floor did you ever see a bed fastened like that before i cannot say that i have the lady could not move her bed it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the ropeor so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bellpull holmes i cried i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime subtle enough and horrible enough when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful about nine oclock the light among the trees was extinguished and all was dark in the direction of the manor house two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us that is our signal said holmes springing to his feet it comes from the middle window as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance and that it was possible that we might spend the night there a moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall making our way among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness my god i whispered did you see it holmes was for the moment as startled as i his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear it is a nice household he murmured that is the baboon i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected there was a cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment i confess that i felt easier in my mind when after following holmes example and slipping off my shoes i found myself inside the bedroom my companion noiselessly closed the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room all was as we had seen it in the daytime then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words the least sound would be fatal to our plans i nodded to show that i had heard we must sit without light he would see it through the ventilator i nodded again do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your pistol ready in case we should need it i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon the bed beside him by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil i could not hear a sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet i knew that my companion sat openeyed within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself the shutters cut off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness from outside came the occasional cry of a nightbird and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour how long they seemed those quarters twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal someone in the next room had lit a darklantern i heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger for half an hour i sat with straining ears then suddenly another sound became audiblea very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle the instant that we heard it holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bellpull you see it watson he yelled you see it but i saw nothing at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely i could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened it swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds it struck cold to our hearts and i stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose what can it mean i gasped it means that it is all over holmes answered and perhaps after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylotts room with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within then he turned the handle and entered i at his heels with the cocked pistol in my hand it was a singular sight which met our eyes on the table stood a darklantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressinggown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head as we entered he made neither sound nor motion the band the speckled band whispered holmes i took a step forward in an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamondshaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent it is a swamp adder cried holmes the deadliest snake in india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened as he spoke he drew the dogwhip swiftly from the dead mans lap and throwing the noose round the reptiles neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arms length threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day i had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data the presence of the gipsies and the use of the word band which was used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door my attention was speedily drawn as i have already remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bellrope which hung down to the bed the discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i was probably on the right track the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage it would be a sharpeyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work then i thought of the whistle of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim he had trained it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed it might or might not bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it with the result of driving it through the ventilator and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr grimesby roylotts death and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience ix the adventure of the engineers thumb of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his noticethat of mr hatherleys thumb and that of colonel warburtons madness of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results the story has i believe been told more than once in the newspapers but like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single halfcolumn of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect it was in the summer of not long after my marriage that the events occurred which i am now about to summarise i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us my practice had steadily increased and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station i got a few patients from among the officials one of these whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence one morning at a little before seven oclock i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consultingroom i dressed hurriedly for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs as i descended my old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him ive got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his shoulder hes all right what is it then i asked for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room its a new patient he whispered i thought id bring him round myself then he couldnt slip away there he is all safe and sound i must go now doctor i have my dooties just the same as you and off he went this trusty tout without even giving me time to thank him i entered my consultingroom and found a gentleman seated by the table he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all over with bloodstains he was young not more than fiveandtwenty i should say with a strong masculine face but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his strength of mind to control i am sorry to knock you up so early doctor said he but i have had a very serious accident during the night i came in by train this morning and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here i gave the maid a card but i see that she has left it upon the sidetable i took it up and glanced at it mr victor hatherley hydraulic engineer a victoria street rd floor that was the name style and abode of my morning visitor i regret that i have kept you waiting said i sitting down in my librarychair you are fresh from a night journey i understand which is in itself a monotonous occupation oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and laughed he laughed very heartily with a high ringing note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh stop it i cried pull yourself together and i poured out some water from a caraffe it was useless however he was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone presently he came to himself once more very weary and palelooking i have been making a fool of myself he gasped not at all drink this i dashed some brandy into the water and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks thats better said he and now doctor perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb used to be he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should have been it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots good heavens i cried this is a terrible injury it must have bled considerably yes it did i fainted when it was done and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time when i came to i found that it was still bleeding so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig excellent you should have been a surgeon it is a question of hydraulics you see and came within my own province this has been done said i examining the wound by a very heavy and sharp instrument a thing like a cleaver said he an accident i presume by no means what a murderous attack very murderous indeed you horrify me i sponged the wound cleaned it dressed it and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages he lay back without wincing though he bit his lip from time to time how is that i asked when i had finished capital between your brandy and your bandage i feel a new man i was very weak but i have had a good deal to go through perhaps you had better not speak of the matter it is evidently trying to your nerves oh no not now i shall have to tell my tale to the police but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine i should be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and even if they believe me the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done ha cried i if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend mr sherlock holmes before you go to the official police oh i have heard of that fellow answered my visitor and i should be very glad if he would take the matter up though of course i must use the official police as well would you give me an introduction to him ill do better ill take you round to him myself i should be immensely obliged to you well call a cab and go together we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him do you feel equal to it yes i shall not feel easy until i have told my story then my servant will call a cab and i shall be with you in an instant i rushed upstairs explained the matter shortly to my wife and in five minutes was inside a hansom driving with my new acquaintance to baker street sherlock holmes was as i expected lounging about his sittingroom in his dressinggown reading the agony column of _the times_ and smoking his beforebreakfast pipe which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece he received us in his quietly genial fashion ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined us in a hearty meal when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa placed a pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one mr hatherley said he pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home tell us what you can but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant thank you said my patient but i have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me and i think that your breakfast has completed the cure i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavylidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature while i sat opposite to him and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us you must know said he that i am an orphan and a bachelor residing alone in lodgings in london by profession i am a hydraulic engineer and i have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that i was apprenticed to venner matheson the wellknown firm of greenwich two years ago having served my time and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor fathers death i determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria street i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience to me it has been exceptionally so during two years i have had three consultations and one small job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me my gross takings amount to _s_ every day from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon i waited in my little den until at last my heart began to sink and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at all yesterday however just as i was thinking of leaving the office my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business he brought up a card too with the name of colonel lysander stark engraved upon it close at his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over the middle size but of an exceeding thinness i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his step brisk and his bearing assured he was plainly but neatly dressed and his age i should judge would be nearer forty than thirty mr hatherley said he with something of a german accent you have been recommended to me mr hatherley as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret i bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character well perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at this moment i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london that is quite correct i answered but you will excuse me if i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications i understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me undoubtedly so but you will find that all i say is really to the point i have a professional commission for you but absolute secrecy is quite essentialabsolute secrecy you understand and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family if i promise to keep a secret said i you may absolutely depend upon my doing so he looked very hard at me as i spoke and it seemed to me that i had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye do you promise then said he at last yes i promise absolute and complete silence before during and after no reference to the matter at all either in word or writing i have already given you my word very good he suddenly sprang up and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door the passage outside was empty thats all right said he coming back i know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their masters affairs now we can talk in safety he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look a feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience i beg that you will state your business sir said i my time is of value heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the words came to my lips how would fifty guineas for a nights work suit you he asked most admirably i say a nights work but an hours would be nearer the mark i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves what do you think of such a commission as that the work appears to be light and the pay munificent precisely so we shall want you to come tonight by the last train where to to eyford in berkshire it is a little place near the borders of oxfordshire and within seven miles of reading there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about very good i shall come down in a carriage to meet you there is a drive then yes our little place is quite out in the country it is a good seven miles from eyford station then we can hardly get there before midnight i suppose there would be no chance of a train back i should be compelled to stop the night yes we could easily give you a shakedown that is very awkward could i not come at some more convenient hour we have judged it best that you should come late it is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession still of course if you would like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do so i thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they would be to me not at all said i i shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes i should like however to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do quite so it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers entirely then the matter stands thus you are probably aware that fullersearth is a valuable product and that it is only found in one or two places in england i have heard so some little time ago i bought a small placea very small placewithin ten miles of reading i was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fullersearth in one of my fields on examining it however i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and leftboth of them however in the grounds of my neighbours these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a goldmine naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this i took a few of my friends into the secret however and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields this we have now been doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press this press as i have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject we guard our secret very jealously however and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts came out it would be goodbye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans that is why i have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to eyford tonight i hope that i make it all plain i quite follow you said i the only point which i could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fullersearth which as i understand is dug out like gravel from a pit ah said he carelessly we have our own process we compress the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing what they are but that is a mere detail i have taken you fully into my confidence now mr hatherley and i have shown you how i trust you he rose as he spoke i shall expect you then at eyford at i shall certainly be there and not a word to a soul he looked at me with a last long questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in a cold dank grasp he hurried from the room well when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very much astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me on the one hand of course i was glad for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked had i set a price upon my own services and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones on the other hand the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me and i could not think that his explanation of the fullersearth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell anyone of my errand however i threw all fears to the winds ate a hearty supper drove to paddington and started off having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station however i was in time for the last train to eyford and i reached the little dimlit station after eleven oclock i was the only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern as i passed out through the wicket gate however i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door of which was standing open he drew up the windows on either side tapped on the woodwork and away we went as fast as the horse could go one horse interjected holmes yes only one did you observe the colour yes i saw it by the sidelights when i was stepping into the carriage it was a chestnut tiredlooking or fresh oh fresh and glossy thank you i am sorry to have interrupted you pray continue your most interesting statement away we went then and we drove for at least an hour colonel lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles but i should think from the rate that we seemed to go and from the time that we took that it must have been nearer twelve he sat at my side in silence all the time and i was aware more than once when i glanced in his direction that he was looking at me with great intensity the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world for we lurched and jolted terribly i tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were but they were made of frosted glass and i could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the conversation soon flagged at last however the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a graveldrive and the carriage came to a stand colonel lysander stark sprang out and as i followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us we stepped as it were right out of the carriage and into the hall so that i failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away it was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a long golden bar of light shot out in our direction it grew broader and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand which she held above her head pushing her face forward and peering at us i could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich material she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand colonel stark went up to her whispered something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes said he throwing open another door it was a quiet little plainly furnished room with a round table in the centre on which several german books were scattered colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door i shall not keep you waiting an instant said he and vanished into the darkness i glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my ignorance of german i could see that two of them were treatises on science the others being volumes of poetry then i walked across to the window hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the countryside but an oak shutter heavily barred was folded across it it was a wonderfully silent house there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise everything was deadly still a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me who were these german people and what were they doing living in this strange outoftheway place and where was the place i was ten miles or so from eyford that was all i knew but whether north south east or west i had no idea for that matter reading and possibly other large towns were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded after all yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the country i paced up and down the room humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my fiftyguinea fee suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open the woman was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind her the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me her eyes glancing back like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her i would go said she trying hard as it seemed to me to speak calmly i would go i should not stay here there is no good for you to do but madam said i i have not yet done what i came for i cannot possibly leave until i have seen the machine it is not worth your while to wait she went on you can pass through the door no one hinders and then seeing that i smiled and shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward with her hands wrung together for the love of heaven she whispered get away from here before it is too late but i am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way i thought of my fiftyguinea fee of my wearisome journey and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me was it all to go for nothing why should i slink away without having carried out my commission and without the payment which was my due this woman might for all i knew be a monomaniac with a stout bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs she listened for an instant threw up her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin who was introduced to me as mr ferguson this is my secretary and manager said the colonel by the way i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now i fear that you have felt the draught on the contrary said i i opened the door myself because i felt the room to be a little close he shot one of his suspicious looks at me perhaps we had better proceed to business then said he mr ferguson and i will take you up to see the machine i had better put my hat on i suppose oh no it is in the house what you dig fullersearth in the house no no this is only where we compress it but never mind that all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it we went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the fat manager and i behind him it was a labyrinth of an old house with corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little low doors the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster was peeling off the walls and the damp was breaking through in green unhealthy blotches i tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible but i had not forgotten the warnings of the lady even though i disregarded them and i kept a keen eye upon my two companions ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellowcountryman colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door which he unlocked within was a small square room in which the three of us could hardly get at one time ferguson remained outside and the colonel ushered me in we are now said he actually within the hydraulic press and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you the machine goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working of it and it has lost a little of its force perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right i took the lamp from him and i examined the machine very thoroughly it was indeed a gigantic one and capable of exercising enormous pressure when i passed outside however and pressed down the levers which controlled it i knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders an examination showed that one of the indiarubber bands which was round the head of a drivingrod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked this was clearly the cause of the loss of power and i pointed it out to my companions who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right when i had made it clear to them i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fullersearth was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose the walls were of wood but the floor consisted of a large iron trough and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me what are you doing there he asked i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me i was admiring your fullersearth said i i think that i should be better able to advise you as to your machine if i knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of my speech his face set hard and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes very well said he you shall know all about the machine he took a step backward slammed the little door and turned the key in the lock i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it was quite secure and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves hullo i yelled hullo colonel let me out and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder he had set the engine at work the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me slowly jerkily but as none knew better than myself with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp i threw myself screaming against the door and dragged with my nails at the lock i implored the colonel to let me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head and with my hand upraised i could feel its hard rough surface then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap easier the other way perhaps and yet had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me already i was unable to stand erect when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the walls were of wood as i gave a last hurried glance around i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward for an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death the next instant i threw myself through and lay halffainting upon the other side the panel had closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me how narrow had been my escape i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist and i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand while she held a candle in her right it was the same good friend whose warning i had so foolishly rejected come come she cried breathlessly they will be here in a moment they will see that you are not there oh do not waste the soprecious time but come this time at least i did not scorn her advice i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair the latter led to another broad passage and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wits end then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shining brightly it is your only chance said she it is high but it may be that you can jump it as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butchers cleaver in the other i rushed across the bedroom flung open the window and looked out how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be more than thirty feet down i clambered out upon the sill but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me if she were illused then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back fritz fritz she cried in english remember your promise after the last time you said it should not be again he will be silent oh he will be silent you are mad elise he shouted struggling to break away from her you will be the ruin of us he has seen too much let me pass i say he dashed her to one side and rushing to the window cut at me with his heavy weapon i had let myself go and was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell i was conscious of a dull pain my grip loosened and i fell into the garden below i was shaken but not hurt by the fall so i picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run for i understood that i was far from being out of danger yet suddenly however as i ran a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me i glanced down at my hand which was throbbing painfully and then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rosebushes how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell it must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself my clothes were all sodden with dew and my coatsleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my nights adventure and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers but to my astonishment when i came to look round me neither house nor garden were to be seen i had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road and just a little lower down was a long building which proved upon my approaching it to be the very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream half dazed i went into the station and asked about the morning train there would be one to reading in less than an hour the same porter was on duty i found as had been there when i arrived i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark the name was strange to him had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me no he had not was there a policestation anywhere near there was one about three miles off it was too far for me to go weak and ill as i was i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police it was a little past six when i arrived so i went first to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings here is an advertisement which will interest you said he it appeared in all the papers about a year ago listen to this lost on the th inst mr jeremiah hayling aged twentysix a hydraulic engineer left his lodgings at ten oclock at night and has not been heard of since was dressed in etc etc ha that represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled i fancy good heavens cried my patient then that explains what the girl said undoubtedly it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game like those outandout pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship well every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together bound from reading to the little berkshire village there were sherlock holmes the hydraulic engineer inspector bradstreet of scotland yard a plainclothes man and myself bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre there you are said he that circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village the place we want must be somewhere near that line you said ten miles i think sir it was an hours good drive and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious they must have done so i have a confused memory too of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere what i cannot understand said i is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden perhaps the villain was softened by the womans entreaties i hardly think that likely i never saw a more inexorable face in my life oh we shall soon clear up all that said bradstreet well i have drawn my circle and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found i think i could lay my finger on it said holmes quietly really now cried the inspector you have formed your opinion come now we shall see who agrees with you i say it is south for the country is more deserted there and i say east said my patient i am for west remarked the plainclothes man there are several quiet little villages up there and i am for north said i because there are no hills there and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any come cried the inspector laughing its a very pretty diversity of opinion we have boxed the compass among us who do you give your casting vote to you are all wrong but we cant all be oh yes you can this is my point he placed his finger in the centre of the circle this is where we shall find them but the twelvemile drive gasped hatherley six out and six back nothing simpler you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed bradstreet thoughtfully of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang none at all said holmes they are coiners on a large scale and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work said the inspector they have been turning out halfcrowns by the thousand we even traced them as far as reading but could get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands but now thanks to this lucky chance i think that we have got them right enough but the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice as we rolled into eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape a house on fire asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way yes sir said the stationmaster when did it break out i hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse and the whole place is in a blaze whose house is it dr bechers tell me broke in the engineer is dr becher a german very thin with a long sharp nose the stationmaster laughed heartily no sir dr becher is an englishman and there isnt a man in the parish who has a betterlined waistcoat but he has a gentleman staying with him a patient as i understand who is a foreigner and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm the stationmaster had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire the road topped a low hill and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us spouting fire at every chink and window while in the garden in front three fireengines were vainly striving to keep the flames under thats it cried hatherley in intense excitement there is the graveldrive and there are the rosebushes where i lay that second window is the one that i jumped from well at least said holmes you have had your revenge upon them there can be no question that it was your oillamp which when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now and holmes fears came to be realised for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the sinister german or the morose englishman early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even holmes ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a windowsill of the second floor about sunset however their efforts were at last successful and they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save some twisted cylinders and iron piping not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an outhouse but no coins were to be found which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a very plain tale he had evidently been carried down by two persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones on the whole it was most probable that the silent englishman being less bold or less murderous than his companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to london it has been a pretty business for me i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fiftyguinea fee and what have i gained experience said holmes laughing indirectly it may be of value you know you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence x the adventure of the noble bachelor the lord st simon marriage and its curious termination have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this fouryearold drama as i have reason to believe however that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public and as my friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up i feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode it was a few weeks before my own marriage during the days when i was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him i had remained indoors all day for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autumnal winds and the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence with my body in one easychair and my legs upon another i had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last saturated with the news of the day i tossed them all aside and lay listless watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friends noble correspondent could be here is a very fashionable epistle i remarked as he entered your morning letters if i remember right were from a fishmonger and a tidewaiter yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more interesting this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie he broke the seal and glanced over the contents oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all not social then no distinctly professional and from a noble client one of the highest in england my dear fellow i congratulate you i assure you watson without affectation that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case it is just possible however that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation you have been reading the papers diligently of late have you not it looks like it said i ruefully pointing to a huge bundle in the corner i have had nothing else to do it is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column the latter is always instructive but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st simon and his wedding oh yes with the deepest interest that is well the letter which i hold in my hand is from lord st simon i will read it to you and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter this is what he says my dear mr sherlock holmeslord backwater tells me that i may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion i have determined therefore to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding mr lestrade of scotland yard is acting already in the matter but he assures me that he sees no objection to your cooperation and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance i will call at four oclock in the afternoon and should you have any other engagement at that time i hope that you will postpone it as this matter is of paramount importance yours faithfully robert st simon it is dated from grosvenor mansions written with a quill pen and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger remarked holmes as he folded up the epistle he says four oclock it is three now he will be here in an hour then i have just time with your assistance to get clear upon the subject turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time while i take a glance as to who our client is he picked a redcovered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece here he is said he sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee lord robert walsingham de vere st simon second son of the duke of balmoral hum arms azure three caltrops in chief over a fess sable born in hes fortyone years of age which is mature for marriage was undersecretary for the colonies in a late administration the duke his father was at one time secretary for foreign affairs they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent and tudor on the distaff side ha well there is nothing very instructive in all this i think that i must turn to you watson for something more solid i have very little difficulty in finding what i want said i for the facts are quite recent and the matter struck me as remarkable i feared to refer them to you however as i knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters oh you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van that is quite cleared up nowthough indeed it was obvious from the first pray give me the results of your newspaper selections here is the first notice which i can find it is in the personal column of the _morning post_ and dates as you see some weeks back a marriage has been arranged it says and will if rumour is correct very shortly take place between lord robert st simon second son of the duke of balmoral and miss hatty doran the only daughter of aloysius doran esq of san francisco cal usa that is all terse and to the point remarked holmes stretching his long thin legs towards the fire there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week ah here it is there will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market for the present freetrade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders lord st simon who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little gods arrows has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty doran the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire miss doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities is an only child and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the future as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years and as lord st simon has no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a british peeress anything else asked holmes yawning oh yes plenty then there is another note in the _morning post_ to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it would be at st georges hanover square that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr aloysius doran two days laterthat is on wednesday lastthere is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord backwaters place near petersfield those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride before the what asked holmes with a start the vanishing of the lady when did she vanish then at the wedding breakfast indeed this is more interesting than it promised to be quite dramatic in fact yes it struck me as being a little out of the common they often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during the honeymoon but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this pray let me have the details i warn you that they are very incomplete perhaps we may make them less so such as they are they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday which i will read to you it is headed singular occurrence at a fashionable wedding the family of lord robert st simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding the ceremony as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday occurred on the previous morning but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about in spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation the ceremony which was performed at st georges hanover square was a very quiet one no one being present save the father of the bride mr aloysius doran the duchess of balmoral lord backwater lord eustace and lady clara st simon the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and lady alicia whittington the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of mr aloysius doran at lancaster gate where breakfast had been prepared it appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging that she had some claim upon lord st simon it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman the bride who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room her prolonged absence having caused some comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress believing her to be with the company on ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared mr aloysius doran in conjunction with the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business up to a late hour last night however nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady there are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some other motive she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride and is that all only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is a suggestive one and it is that miss flora millar the lady who had caused the disturbance has actually been arrested it appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_ at the allegro and that she has known the bridegroom for some years there are no further particulars and the whole case is in your hands nowso far as it has been set forth in the public press and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be i would not have missed it for worlds but there is a ring at the bell watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client do not dream of going watson for i very much prefer having a witness if only as a check to my own memory lord robert st simon announced our pageboy throwing open the door a gentleman entered with a pleasant cultured face highnosed and pale with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth and with the steady wellopened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed his manner was brisk and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked his hair too as he swept off his very curlybrimmed hat was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top as to his dress it was careful to the verge of foppishness with high collar black frockcoat white waistcoat yellow gloves patentleather shoes and lightcoloured gaiters he advanced slowly into the room turning his head from left to right and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses goodday lord st simon said holmes rising and bowing pray take the basketchair this is my friend and colleague dr watson draw up a little to the fire and we will talk this matter over a most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine mr holmes i have been cut to the quick i understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of society no i am descending i beg pardon my last client of the sort was a king oh really i had no idea and which king the king of scandinavia what had he lost his wife you can understand said holmes suavely that i extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours of course very right very right im sure i beg pardon as to my own case i am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion thank you i have already learned all that is in the public prints nothing more i presume that i may take it as correctthis article for example as to the disappearance of the bride lord st simon glanced over it yes it is correct as far as it goes but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you pray do so when did you first meet miss hatty doran in san francisco a year ago you were travelling in the states yes did you become engaged then no but you were on a friendly footing i was amused by her society and she could see that i was amused her father is very rich he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope and how did he make his money in mining he had nothing a few years ago then he struck gold invested it and came up by leaps and bounds now what is your own impression as to the young ladysyour wifes character the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire you see mr holmes said he my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man during that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains so that her education has come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster she is what we call in england a tomboy with a strong nature wild and free unfettered by any sort of traditions she is impetuousvolcanic i was about to say she is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions on the other hand i would not have given her the name which i have the honour to bearhe gave a little stately coughhad i not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman i believe that she is capable of heroic selfsacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her have you her photograph i brought this with me he opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman it was not a photograph but an ivory miniature and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair the large dark eyes and the exquisite mouth holmes gazed long and earnestly at it then he closed the locket and handed it back to lord st simon the young lady came to london then and you renewed your acquaintance yes her father brought her over for this last london season i met her several times became engaged to her and have now married her she brought i understand a considerable dowry a fair dowry not more than is usual in my family and this of course remains to you since the marriage is a _fait accompli_ i really have made no inquiries on the subject very naturally not did you see miss doran on the day before the wedding yes was she in good spirits never better she kept talking of what we should do in our future lives indeed that is very interesting and on the morning of the wedding she was as bright as possibleat least until after the ceremony and did you observe any change in her then well to tell the truth i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp the incident however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case pray let us have it for all that oh it is childish she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry she was passing the front pew at the time and it fell over into the pew there was a moments delay but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall yet when i spoke to her of the matter she answered me abruptly and in the carriage on our way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause indeed you say that there was a gentleman in the pew some of the general public were present then oh yes it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open this gentleman was not one of your wifes friends no no i call him a gentleman by courtesy but he was quite a commonlooking person i hardly noticed his appearance but really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point lady st simon then returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it what did she do on reentering her fathers house i saw her in conversation with her maid and who is her maid alice is her name she is an american and came from california with her a confidential servant a little too much so it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties still of course in america they look upon these things in a different way how long did she speak to this alice oh a few minutes i had something else to think of you did not overhear what they said lady st simon said something about jumping a claim she was accustomed to use slang of the kind i have no idea what she meant american slang is very expressive sometimes and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid she walked into the breakfastroom on your arm no alone she was very independent in little matters like that then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room she never came back but this maid alice as i understand deposes that she went to her room covered her brides dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out quite so and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar a woman who is now in custody and who had already made a disturbance at mr dorans house that morning ah yes i should like a few particulars as to this young lady and your relations to her lord st simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows we have been on a friendly footing for some yearsi may say on a _very_ friendly footing she used to be at the allegro i have not treated her ungenerously and she had no just cause of complaint against me but you know what women are mr holmes flora was a dear little thing but exceedingly hotheaded and devotedly attached to me she wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married and to tell the truth the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that i feared lest there might be a scandal in the church she came to mr dorans door just after we returned and she endeavoured to push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife and even threatening her but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort and i had two police fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row did your wife hear all this no thank goodness she did not and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards yes that is what mr lestrade of scotland yard looks upon as so serious it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her well it is a possible supposition you think so too i did not say a probable one but you do not yourself look upon this as likely i do not think flora would hurt a fly still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters pray what is your own theory as to what took place well really i came to seek a theory not to propound one i have given you all the facts since you ask me however i may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife in short that she had become suddenly deranged well really when i consider that she has turned her backi will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to without successi can hardly explain it in any other fashion well certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis said holmes smiling and now lord st simon i think that i have nearly all my data may i ask whether you were seated at the breakfasttable so that you could see out of the window we could see the other side of the road and the park quite so then i do not think that i need to detain you longer i shall communicate with you should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem said our client rising i have solved it eh what was that i say that i have solved it where then is my wife that is a detail which i shall speedily supply lord st simon shook his head i am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine he remarked and bowing in a stately oldfashioned manner he departed it is very good of lord st simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own said sherlock holmes laughing i think that i shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this crossquestioning i had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room my dear holmes i have notes of several similar cases though none as i remarked before which were quite as prompt my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find a trout in the milk to quote thoreaus example but i have heard all that you have heard without however the knowledge of preexisting cases which serves me so well there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the francoprussian war it is one of these casesbut hullo here is lestrade goodafternoon lestrade you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are cigars in the box the official detective was attired in a peajacket and cravat which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him whats up then asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye you look dissatisfied and i feel dissatisfied it is this infernal st simon marriage case i can make neither head nor tail of the business really you surprise me who ever heard of such a mixed affair every clue seems to slip through my fingers i have been at work upon it all day and very wet it seems to have made you said holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the peajacket yes i have been dragging the serpentine in heavens name what for in search of the body of lady st simon sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain he asked why what do you mean because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion i suppose you know all about it he snarled well i have only just heard the facts but my mind is made up oh indeed then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the matter i think it very unlikely then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it he opened his bag as he spoke and tumbled onto the floor a weddingdress of watered silk a pair of white satin shoes and a brides wreath and veil all discoloured and soaked in water there said he putting a new weddingring upon the top of the pile there is a little nut for you to crack master holmes oh indeed said my friend blowing blue rings into the air you dragged them from the serpentine no they were found floating near the margin by a parkkeeper they have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off by the same brilliant reasoning every mans body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance i am afraid that you will find it difficult are you indeed now cried lestrade with some bitterness i am afraid holmes that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences you have made two blunders in as many minutes this dress does implicate miss flora millar and how in the dress is a pocket in the pocket is a cardcase in the cardcase is a note and here is the very note he slapped it down upon the table in front of him listen to this you will see me when all is ready come at once f h m now my theory all along has been that lady st simon was decoyed away by flora millar and that she with confederates no doubt was responsible for her disappearance here signed with her initials is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach very good lestrade said holmes laughing you really are very fine indeed let me see it he took up the paper in a listless way but his attention instantly became riveted and he gave a little cry of satisfaction this is indeed important said he ha you find it so extremely so i congratulate you warmly lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look why he shrieked youre looking at the wrong side on the contrary this is the right side the right side youre mad here is the note written in pencil over here and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill which interests me deeply theres nothing in it i looked at it before said lestrade oct th rooms _s_ breakfast _s_ _d_ cocktail _s_ lunch _s_ _d_ glass sherry _d_ i see nothing in that very likely not it is most important all the same as to the note it is important also or at least the initials are so i congratulate you again ive wasted time enough said lestrade rising i believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories goodday mr holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first he gathered up the garments thrust them into the bag and made for the door just one hint to you lestrade drawled holmes before his rival vanished i will tell you the true solution of the matter lady st simon is a myth there is not and there never has been any such person lestrade looked sadly at my companion then he turned to me tapped his forehead three times shook his head solemnly and hurried away he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on his overcoat there is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work he remarked so i think watson that i must leave you to your papers for a little it was after five oclock when sherlock holmes left me but i had no time to be lonely for within an hour there arrived a confectioners man with a very large flat box this he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him and presently to my very great astonishment a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodginghouse mahogany there were a couple of brace of cold woodcock a pheasant a _pâté de foie gras_ pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles having laid out all these luxuries my two visitors vanished away like the genii of the arabian nights with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address just before nine oclock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room his features were gravely set but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions they have laid the supper then he said rubbing his hands you seem to expect company they have laid for five yes i fancy we may have some company dropping in said he i am surprised that lord st simon has not already arrived ha i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features my messenger reached you then asked holmes yes and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure have you good authority for what you say the best possible lord st simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead what will the duke say he murmured when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation it is the purest accident i cannot allow that there is any humiliation ah you look on these things from another standpoint i fail to see that anyone is to blame i can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted having no mother she had no one to advise her at such a crisis it was a slight sir a public slight said lord st simon tapping his fingers upon the table you must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so unprecedented a position i will make no allowance i am very angry indeed and i have been shamefully used i think that i heard a ring said holmes yes there are steps on the landing if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter lord st simon i have brought an advocate here who may be more successful he opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman lord st simon said he allow me to introduce you to mr and mrs francis hay moulton the lady i think you have already met at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frockcoat a picture of offended dignity the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes it was as well for his resolution perhaps for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist youre angry robert said she well i guess you have every cause to be pray make no apology to me said lord st simon bitterly oh yes i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should have spoken to you before i went but i was kind of rattled and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didnt know what i was doing or saying i only wonder i didnt fall down and do a faint right there before the altar perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter if i may give an opinion remarked the strange gentleman weve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already for my part i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it he was a small wiry sunburnt man cleanshaven with a sharp face and alert manner then ill tell our story right away said the lady frank here and i met in in mcquires camp near the rockies where pa was working a claim we were engaged to each other frank and i but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing the richer pa grew the poorer was frank so at last pa wouldnt hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took me away to frisco frank wouldnt throw up his hand though so he followed me there and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it it would only have made him mad to know so we just fixed it all up for ourselves frank said that he would go and make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived why shouldnt we be married right away then said he and then i will feel sure of you and i wont claim to be your husband until i come back well we talked it over and he had fixed it all up so nicely with a clergyman all ready in waiting that we just did it right there and then frank went off to seek his fortune and i went back to pa the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana and then he went prospecting in arizona and then i heard of him from new mexico after that came a long newspaper story about how a miners camp had been attacked by apache indians and there was my franks name among the killed i fainted dead away and i was very sick for months after pa thought i had a decline and took me to half the doctors in frisco not a word of news came for a year and more so that i never doubted that frank was really dead then lord st simon came to frisco and we came to london and a marriage was arranged and pa was very pleased but i felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor frank still if i had married lord st simon of course id have done my duty by him we cant command our love but we can our actions i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be but you may imagine what i felt when just as i came to the altar rails i glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew i thought it was his ghost at first but when i looked again there he was still with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him i wonder i didnt drop i know that everything was turning round and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear i didnt know what to do should i stop the service and make a scene in the church i glanced at him again and he seemed to know what i was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper and i knew that he was writing me a note as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers it was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so of course i never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him and i determined to do just whatever he might direct when i got back i told my maid who had known him in california and had always been his friend i ordered her to say nothing but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready i know i ought to have spoken to lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards i hadnt been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park i slipped out put on my things and followed him some woman came talking something or other about lord st simon to meseemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage alsobut i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank we got into a cab together and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting frank had been a prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to frisco found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england followed me there and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding i saw it in a paper explained the american it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived then we had a talk as to what we should do and frank was all for openness but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them againjust sending a line to pa perhaps to show him that i was alive it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfasttable and waiting for me to come back so frank took my weddingclothes and things and made a bundle of them so that i should not be traced and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them it is likely that we should have gone on to paris tomorrow only that this good gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than i can think and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at once now robert you have heard it all and i am very sorry if i have given you pain and i hope that you do not think very meanly of me lord st simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner then you wont forgive me you wont shake hands before i go oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him i had hoped suggested holmes that you would have joined us in a friendly supper i think that there you ask a little too much responded his lordship i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments but i can hardly be expected to make merry over them i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a very goodnight he included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company said sherlock holmes it is always a joy to meet an american mr moulton for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in fargone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same worldwide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes the case has been an interesting one remarked holmes when our visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing stranger than the result when viewed for instance by mr lestrade of scotland yard you were not yourself at fault at all then from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home obviously something had occurred during the morning then to cause her to change her mind what could that something be she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom had she seen someone then if she had it must be someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely you see we have already arrived by a process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an american then who could this american be and why should he possess so much influence over her it might be a lover it might be a husband her young womanhood had i knew been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions so far i had got before i ever heard lord st simons narrative when he told us of a man in a pew of the change in the brides manner of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and of her very significant allusion to claimjumpingwhich in miners parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim tothe whole situation became absolutely clear she had gone off with a man and the man was either a lover or was a previous husbandthe chances being in favour of the latter and how in the world did you find them it might have been difficult but friend lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know the initials were of course of the highest importance but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels how did you deduce the select by the select prices eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels there are not many in london which charge at that rate in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue i learned by an inspection of the book that francis h moulton an american gentleman had left only the day before and on looking over the entries against him i came upon the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill his letters were to be forwarded to gordon square so thither i travelled and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home i ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to lord st simon in particular i invited them to meet him here and as you see i made him keep the appointment but with no very good result i remarked his conduct was certainly not very gracious ah watson said holmes smiling perhaps you would not be very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and wedding you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune i think that we may judge lord st simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position draw your chair up and hand me my violin for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings xi the adventure of the beryl coronet holmes said i as i stood one morning in our bowwindow looking down the street here is a madman coming along it seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressinggown looking over my shoulder it was a bright crisp february morning and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground shimmering brightly in the wintry sun down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic but at either side and on the heapedup edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped but was still dangerously slippery so that there were fewer passengers than usual indeed from the direction of the metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention he was a man of about fifty tall portly and imposing with a massive strongly marked face and a commanding figure he was dressed in a sombre yet rich style in black frockcoat shining hat neat brown gaiters and wellcut pearlgrey trousers yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features for he was running hard with occasional little springs such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs as he ran he jerked his hands up and down waggled his head and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions what on earth can be the matter with him i asked he is looking up at the numbers of the houses i believe that he is coming here said holmes rubbing his hands here yes i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally i think that i recognise the symptoms ha did i not tell you as he spoke the man puffing and blowing rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging a few moments later he was in our room still puffing still gesticulating but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity for a while he could not get his words out but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason then suddenly springing to his feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easychair and sitting beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ you have come to me to tell your story have you not said he you are fatigued with your haste pray wait until you have recovered yourself and then i shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest fighting against his emotion then he passed his handkerchief over his brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us no doubt you think me mad said he i see that you have had some great trouble responded holmes god knows i havea trouble which is enough to unseat my reason so sudden and so terrible is it public disgrace i might have faced although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain private affliction also is the lot of every man but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have been enough to shake my very soul besides it is not i alone the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair pray compose yourself sir said holmes and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you my name answered our visitor is probably familiar to your ears i am alexander holder of the banking firm of holder stevenson of threadneedle street the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city of london what could have happened then to bring one of the foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass we waited all curiosity until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story i feel that time is of value said he that is why i hastened here when the police inspector suggested that i should secure your cooperation i came to baker street by the underground and hurried from there on foot for the cabs go slowly through this snow that is why i was so out of breath for i am a man who takes very little exercise i feel better now and i will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as i can it is of course well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors one of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans where the security is unimpeachable we have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures libraries or plate yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks i started when i saw the name for it was that of none other thanwell perhaps even to you i had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earthone of the highest noblest most exalted names in england i was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted when he entered to say so but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task mr holder said he i have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money the firm does so when the security is good i answered it is absolutely essential to me said he that i should have at once i could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends but i much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself in my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place ones self under obligations for how long may i ask do you want this sum i asked next monday i have a large sum due to me and i shall then most certainly repay what you advance with whatever interest you think it right to charge but it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse said i were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear if on the other hand i am to do it in the name of the firm then in justice to my partner i must insist that even in your case every businesslike precaution should be taken i should much prefer to have it so said he raising up a square black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet one of the most precious public possessions of the empire said i precisely he opened the case and there imbedded in soft fleshcoloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named there are thirtynine enormous beryls said he and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable the lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked i am prepared to leave it with you as my security i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client you doubt its value he asked not at all i only doubt the propriety of my leaving it you may set your mind at rest about that i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it it is a pure matter of form is the security sufficient ample you understand mr holder that i am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which i have in you founded upon all that i have heard of you i rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but above all to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because i need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss for there are no beryls in the world to match these and it would be impossible to replace them i leave it with you however with every confidence and i shall call for it in person on monday morning seeing that my client was anxious to leave i said no more but calling for my cashier i ordered him to pay over fifty notes when i was alone once more however with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me i could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me there could be no doubt that as it was a national possession a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it i already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it however it was too late to alter the matter now so i locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me bankers safes had been forced before now and why should not mine be if so how terrible would be the position in which i should find myself i determined therefore that for the next few days i would always carry the case backward and forward with me so that it might never be really out of my reach with this intention i called a cab and drove out to my house at streatham carrying the jewel with me i did not breathe freely until i had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressingroom and now a word as to my household mr holmes for i wish you to thoroughly understand the situation my groom and my page sleep out of the house and may be set aside altogether i have three maidservants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion another lucy parr the second waitingmaid has only been in my service a few months she came with an excellent character however and has always given me satisfaction she is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place that is the only drawback which we have found to her but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way so much for the servants my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it i am a widower and have an only son arthur he has been a disappointment to me mr holmesa grievous disappointment i have no doubt that i am myself to blame people tell me that i have spoiled him very likely i have when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i had to love i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face i have never denied him a wish perhaps it would have been better for both of us had i been sterner but i meant it for the best it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business but he was not of a business turn he was wild wayward and to speak the truth i could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club and there having charming manners he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits he learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance that he might settle his debts of honour he tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping but each time the influence of his friend sir george burnwell was enough to draw him back again and indeed i could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell should gain an influence over him for he has frequently brought him to my house and i have found myself that i could hardly resist the fascination of his manner he is older than arthur a man of the world to his fingertips one who had been everywhere seen everything a brilliant talker and a man of great personal beauty yet when i think of him in cold blood far away from the glamour of his presence i am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which i have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted so i think and so too thinks my little mary who has a womans quick insight into character and now there is only she to be described she is my niece but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world i adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter she is a sunbeam in my housesweet loving beautiful a wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be she is my right hand i do not know what i could do without her in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes twice my boy has asked her to marry him for he loves her devotedly but each time she has refused him i think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his whole life but now alas it is too lateforever too late now mr holmes you know the people who live under my roof and i shall continue with my miserable story when we were taking coffee in the drawingroom that night after dinner i told arthur and mary my experience and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof suppressing only the name of my client lucy parr who had brought in the coffee had i am sure left the room but i cannot swear that the door was closed mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet but i thought it better not to disturb it where have you put it asked arthur in my own bureau well i hope to goodness the house wont be burgled during the night said he it is locked up i answered oh any old key will fit that bureau when i was a youngster i have opened it myself with the key of the boxroom cupboard he often had a wild way of talking so that i thought little of what he said he followed me to my room however that night with a very grave face look here dad said he with his eyes cast down can you let me have no i cannot i answered sharply i have been far too generous with you in money matters you have been very kind said he but i must have this money or else i can never show my face inside the club again and a very good thing too i cried yes but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man said he i could not bear the disgrace i must raise the money in some way and if you will not let me have it then i must try other means i was very angry for this was the third demand during the month you shall not have a farthing from me i cried on which he bowed and left the room without another word when he was gone i unlocked my bureau made sure that my treasure was safe and locked it again then i started to go round the house to see that all was securea duty which i usually leave to mary but which i thought it well to perform myself that night as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as i approached tell me dad said she looking i thought a little disturbed did you give lucy the maid leave to go out tonight certainly not she came in just now by the back door i have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone but i think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped you must speak to her in the morning or i will if you prefer it are you sure that everything is fastened quite sure dad then goodnight i kissed her and went up to my bedroom again where i was soon asleep i am endeavouring to tell you everything mr holmes which may have any bearing upon the case but i beg that you will question me upon any point which i do not make clear on the contrary your statement is singularly lucid i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be particularly so i am not a very heavy sleeper and the anxiety in my mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual about two in the morning then i was awakened by some sound in the house it had ceased ere i was wide awake but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere i lay listening with all my ears suddenly to my horror there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room i slipped out of bed all palpitating with fear and peeped round the corner of my dressingroom door arthur i screamed you villain you thief how dare you touch that coronet the gas was half up as i had left it and my unhappy boy dressed only in his shirt and trousers was standing beside the light holding the coronet in his hands he appeared to be wrenching at it or bending it with all his strength at my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death i snatched it up and examined it one of the gold corners with three of the beryls in it was missing you blackguard i shouted beside myself with rage you have destroyed it you have dishonoured me forever where are the jewels which you have stolen stolen he cried yes thief i roared shaking him by the shoulder there are none missing there cannot be any missing said he there are three missing and you know where they are must i call you a liar as well as a thief did i not see you trying to tear off another piece you have called me names enough said he i will not stand it any longer i shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me i will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world you shall leave it in the hands of the police i cried halfmad with grief and rage i shall have this matter probed to the bottom you shall learn nothing from me said he with a passion such as i should not have thought was in his nature if you choose to call the police let the police find what they can by this time the whole house was astir for i had raised my voice in my anger mary was the first to rush into my room and at the sight of the coronet and of arthurs face she read the whole story and with a scream fell down senseless on the ground i sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once when the inspector and a constable entered the house arthur who had stood sullenly with his arms folded asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft i answered that it had ceased to be a private matter but had become a public one since the ruined coronet was national property i was determined that the law should have its way in everything at least said he you will not have me arrested at once it would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for five minutes that you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen said i and then realising the dreadful position in which i was placed i implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than i was at stake and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation he might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones you may as well face the matter said i you have been caught in the act and no confession could make your guilt more heinous if you but make such reparation as is in your power by telling us where the beryls are all shall be forgiven and forgotten keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it he answered turning away from me with a sneer i saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him there was but one way for it i called in the inspector and gave him into custody a search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems but no trace of them could be found nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats this morning he was removed to a cell and i after going through all the police formalities have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it you may go to any expense which you think necessary i have already offered a reward of my god what shall i do i have lost my honour my gems and my son in one night oh what shall i do he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire do you receive much company he asked none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of arthurs sir george burnwell has been several times lately no one else i think do you go out much in society arthur does mary and i stay at home we neither of us care for it that is unusual in a young girl she is of a quiet nature besides she is not so very young she is fourandtwenty this matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to her also terrible she is even more affected than i you have neither of you any doubt as to your sons guilt how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands i hardly consider that a conclusive proof was the remainder of the coronet at all injured yes it was twisted do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten it god bless you you are doing what you can for him and for me but it is too heavy a task what was he doing there at all if his purpose were innocent why did he not say so precisely and if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie his silence appears to me to cut both ways there are several singular points about the case what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep they considered that it might be caused by arthurs closing his bedroom door a likely story as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household what did they say then of the disappearance of these gems they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them have they thought of looking outside the house yes they have shown extraordinary energy the whole garden has already been minutely examined now my dear sir said holmes is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think it appeared to you to be a simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex consider what is involved by your theory you suppose that your son came down from his bed went at great risk to your dressingroom opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main force a small portion of it went off to some other place concealed three gems out of the thirtynine with such skill that nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirtysix into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered i ask you now is such a theory tenable but what other is there cried the banker with a gesture of despair if his motives were innocent why does he not explain them it is our task to find that out replied holmes so now if you please mr holder we will set off for streatham together and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition which i was eager enough to do for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened i confess that the guilt of the bankers son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still i had such faith in holmes judgment that i felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank the modest residence of the great financier fairbank was a goodsized square house of white stone standing back a little from the road a double carriagesweep with a snowclad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance on the right side was a small wooden thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the tradesmens entrance on the left ran a lane which led to the stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being a public though little used thoroughfare holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the front down the tradesmens path and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane so long was he that mr holder and i went into the diningroom and waited by the fire until he should return we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in she was rather above the middle height slim with dark hair and eyes which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin i do not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a womans face her lips too were bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character with immense capacity for selfrestraint disregarding my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress you have given orders that arthur should be liberated have you not dad she asked no no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom but i am so sure that he is innocent you know what womans instincts are i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly why is he silent then if he is innocent who knows perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him how could i help suspecting him when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand oh but he had only picked it up to look at it oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent let the matter drop and say no more it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison i shall never let it drop until the gems are foundnever mary your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me far from hushing the thing up i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it this gentleman she asked facing round to me no his friend he wished us to leave him alone he is round in the stable lane now the stable lane she raised her dark eyebrows what can he hope to find there ah this i suppose is he i trust sir that you will succeed in proving what i feel sure is the truth that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime i fully share your opinion and i trust with you that we may prove it returned holmes going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary holder might i ask you a question or two pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up you heard nothing yourself last night nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly i heard that and i came down you shut up the windows and doors the night before did you fasten all the windows yes were they all fastened this morning yes you have a maid who has a sweetheart i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawingroom and who may have heard uncles remarks about the coronet i see you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery but what is the good of all these vague theories cried the banker impatiently when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands wait a little mr holder we must come back to that about this girl miss holder you saw her return by the kitchen door i presume yes when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met her slipping in i saw the man too in the gloom do you know him oh yes he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round his name is francis prosper he stood said holmes to the left of the doorthat is to say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door yes he did and he is a man with a wooden leg something like fear sprang up in the young ladys expressive black eyes why you are like a magician said she how do you know that she smiled but there was no answering smile in holmes thin eager face i should be very glad now to go upstairs said he i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up he walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens now we shall go upstairs said he at last the bankers dressingroom was a plainly furnished little chamber with a grey carpet a large bureau and a long mirror holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock which key was used to open it he asked that which my son himself indicatedthat of the cupboard of the lumberroom have you it here that is it on the dressingtable sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau it is a noiseless lock said he it is no wonder that it did not wake you this case i presume contains the coronet we must have a look at it he opened the case and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table it was a magnificent specimen of the jewellers art and the thirtysix stones were the finest that i have ever seen at one side of the coronet was a cracked edge where a corner holding three gems had been torn away now mr holder said holmes here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost might i beg that you will break it off the banker recoiled in horror i should not dream of trying said he then i will holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it but without result i feel it give a little said he but though i am exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my time to break it an ordinary man could not do it now what do you think would happen if i did break it mr holder there would be a noise like a pistol shot do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it i do not know what to think it is all dark to me but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go what do you think miss holder i confess that i still share my uncles perplexity your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt thank you we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up with your permission mr holder i shall now continue my investigations outside he went alone at his own request for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult for an hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever i think that i have seen now all that there is to see mr holder said he i can serve you best by returning to my rooms but the gems mr holmes where are they i cannot tell the banker wrung his hands i shall never see them again he cried and my son you give me hopes my opinion is in no way altered then for gods sake what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms tomorrow morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it clearer i understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you provided only that i get back the gems and that you place no limit on the sum i may draw i would give my fortune to have them back very good i shall look into the matter between this and then goodbye it is just possible that i may have to come over here again before evening it was obvious to me that my companions mind was now made up about the case although what his conclusions were was more than i could even dimly imagine several times during our homeward journey i endeavoured to sound him upon the point but he always glided away to some other topic until at last i gave it over in despair it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more he hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer with his collar turned up his shiny seedy coat his red cravat and his worn boots he was a perfect sample of the class i think that this should do said he glancing into the glass above the fireplace i only wish that you could come with me watson but i fear that it wont do i may be on the trail in this matter or i may be following a willothewisp but i shall soon know which it is i hope that i may be back in a few hours he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard sandwiched it between two rounds of bread and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition i had just finished my tea when he returned evidently in excellent spirits swinging an old elasticsided boot in his hand he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea i only looked in as i passed said he i am going right on where to oh to the other side of the west end it may be some time before i get back dont wait up for me in case i should be late how are you getting on oh so so nothing to complain of i have been out to streatham since i saw you last but i did not call at the house it is a very sweet little problem and i would not have missed it for a good deal however i must not sit gossiping here but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply his eyes twinkled and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks he hastened upstairs and a few minutes later i heard the slam of the hall door which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt i waited until midnight but there was no sign of his return so i retired to my room it was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent so that his lateness caused me no surprise i do not know at what hour he came in but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other as fresh and trim as possible you will excuse my beginning without you watson said he but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning why it is after nine now i answered i should not be surprised if that were he i thought i heard a ring it was indeed our friend the financier i was shocked by the change which had come over him for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould was now pinched and fallen in while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter he entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before and he dropped heavily into the armchair which i pushed forward for him i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried said he only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man without a care in the world now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured age one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another my niece mary has deserted me deserted you yes her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was empty and a note for me lay upon the hall table i had said to her last night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so it is to that remark that she refers in this note my dearest unclei feel that i have brought trouble upon you and that if i had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred i cannot with this thought in my mind ever again be happy under your roof and i feel that i must leave you forever do not worry about my future for that is provided for and above all do not search for me for it will be fruitless labour and an illservice to me in life or in death i am ever your loving mary what could she mean by that note mr holmes do you think it points to suicide no no nothing of the kind it is perhaps the best possible solution i trust mr holder that you are nearing the end of your troubles ha you say so you have heard something mr holmes you have learned something where are the gems you would not think apiece an excessive sum for them i would pay ten that would be unnecessary three thousand will cover the matter and there is a little reward i fancy have you your chequebook here is a pen better make it out for with a dazed face the banker made out the required check holmes walked over to his desk took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it and threw it down upon the table with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up you have it he gasped i am saved i am saved the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom there is one other thing you owe mr holder said sherlock holmes rather sternly owe he caught up a pen name the sum and i will pay it no the debt is not to me you owe a very humble apology to that noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as i should be proud to see my own son do should i ever chance to have one then it was not arthur who took them i told you yesterday and i repeat today that it was not you are sure of it then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known he knows it already when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the story i told it to him on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me your news of this morning however may open his lips for heavens sake tell me then what is this extraordinary mystery i will do so and i will show you the steps by which i reached it and let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear there has been an understanding between sir george burnwell and your niece mary they have now fled together my mary impossible it is unfortunately more than possible it is certain neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle he is one of the most dangerous men in englanda ruined gambler an absolutely desperate villain a man without heart or conscience your niece knew nothing of such men when he breathed his vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart the devil knows best what he said but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening i cannot and i will not believe it cried the banker with an ashen face i will tell you then what occurred in your house last night your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane his footmarks had pressed right through the snow so long had he stood there she told him of the coronet his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news and he bent her to his will i have no doubt that she loved you but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves and i think that she must have been one she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants escapade with her woodenlegged lover which was all perfectly true your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door so he rose and looking out was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressingroom petrified with astonishment the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair presently she emerged from the room again and in the light of the passagelamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands she passed down the stairs and he thrilling with horror ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath he saw her stealthily open the window hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom and then closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved but the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you and how allimportant it was to set it right he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight sir george burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the coronet and his opponent at the other in the scuffle your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye then something suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene is it possible gasped the banker you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands he took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her secret and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet cried mr holder oh my god what a blind fool i have been and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle how cruelly i have misjudged him when i arrived at the house continued holmes i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me i knew that none had fallen since the evening before and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions i passed along the tradesmens path but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable just beyond it however at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had stood and talked with a man whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg i could even tell that they had been disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks while woodenleg had waited a little and then had gone away i thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had already spoken to me and inquiry showed it was so i passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks which i took to be the police but when i got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me there was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a second double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son the first had walked both ways but the other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot it was obvious that he had passed after the other i followed them up and found they led to the hall window where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting then i walked to the other end which was a hundred yards or more down the lane i saw where boots had faced round where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle and finally where a few drops of blood had fallen to show me that i was not mistaken boots had then run down the lane and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt when he came to the high road at the other end i found that the pavement had been cleared so there was an end to that clue on entering the house however i examined as you remember the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens and i could at once see that someone had passed out i could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred a man had waited outside the window someone had brought the gems the deed had been overseen by your son he had pursued the thief had struggled with him they had each tugged at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected he had returned with the prize but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent so far i was clear the question now was who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth now i knew that it was not you who had brought it down so there only remained your niece and the maids but if it were the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place there could be no possible reason as he loved his cousin however there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secretthe more so as the secret was a disgraceful one when i remembered that you had seen her at that window and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture became a certainty and who could it be who was her confederate a lover evidently for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you i knew that you went out little and that your circle of friends was a very limited one but among them was sir george burnwell i had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women it must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems even though he knew that arthur had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family well your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next i went in the shape of a loafer to sir georges house managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that his master had cut his head the night before and finally at the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of his castoff shoes with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks i saw an illdressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening said mr holder precisely it was i i found that i had my man so i came home and changed my clothes it was a delicate part which i had to play then for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter i went and saw him at first of course he denied everything but when i gave him every particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a lifepreserver from the wall i knew my man however and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike then he became a little more reasonable i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held apiece that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown why dash it all said he ive let them go at six hundred for the three i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them on promising him that there would be no prosecution off i set to him and after much chaffering i got our stones at apiece then i looked in upon your son told him that all was right and eventually got to my bed about two oclock after what i may call a really hard days work a day which has saved england from a great public scandal said the banker rising sir i cannot find words to thank you but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it and now i must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which i have done him as to what you tell me of poor mary it goes to my very heart not even your skill can inform me where she is now i think that we may safely say returned holmes that she is wherever sir george burnwell is it is equally certain too that whatever her sins are they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment xii the adventure of the copper beeches to the man who loves art for its own sake remarked sherlock holmes tossing aside the advertisement sheet of _the daily telegraph_ it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived it is pleasant to me to observe watson that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up and i am bound to say occasionally to embellish you have given prominence not so much to the many _causes célèbres_ and sensational trials in which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province and yet said i smiling i cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records you have erred perhaps he observed taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherrywood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative moodyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter i remarked with some coldness for i was repelled by the egotism which i had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friends singular character no it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as was his wont my thoughts rather than my words if i claim full justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thinga thing beyond myself crime is common logic is rare therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales it was a cold morning of the early spring and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at baker street a thick fog rolled down between the lines of duncoloured houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal for the table had not been cleared yet sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last having apparently given up his search he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings at the same time he remarked after a pause during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in a fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal sense at all the small matter in which i endeavoured to help the king of bohemia the singular experience of miss mary sutherland the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are outside the pale of the law but in avoiding the sensational i fear that you may have bordered on the trivial the end may have been so i answered but the methods i hold to have been novel and of interest pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction but indeed if you are trivial i cannot blame you for the days of the great cases are past man or at least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality as to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boardingschools i think that i have touched bottom at last however this note i had this morning marks my zeropoint i fancy read it he tossed a crumpled letter across to me it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening and ran thus dear mr holmesi am very anxious to consult you as to whether i should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess i shall call at halfpast ten tomorrow if i do not inconvenience you yours faithfully violet hunter do you know the young lady i asked not i it is halfpast ten now yes and i have no doubt that is her ring it may turn out to be of more interest than you think you remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to be a mere whim at first developed into a serious investigation it may be so in this case also well let us hope so but our doubts will very soon be solved for here unless i am much mistaken is the person in question as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room she was plainly but neatly dressed with a bright quick face freckled like a plovers egg and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world you will excuse my troubling you i am sure said she as my companion rose to greet her but i have had a very strange experience and as i have no parents or relations of any sort from whom i could ask advice i thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what i should do pray take a seat miss hunter i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you i could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client he looked her over in his searching fashion and then composed himself with his lids drooping and his fingertips together to listen to her story i have been a governess for five years said she in the family of colonel spence munro but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at halifax in nova scotia and took his children over to america with him so that i found myself without a situation i advertised and i answered advertisements but without success at last the little money which i had saved began to run short and i was at my wits end as to what i should do there is a wellknown agency for governesses in the west end called westaways and there i used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me westaway was the name of the founder of the business but it is really managed by miss stoper she sits in her own little office and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom and are then shown in one by one when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them well when i called last week i was shown into the little office as usual but i found that miss stoper was not alone a prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered as i came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to miss stoper that will do said he i could not ask for anything better capital capital he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion he was such a comfortablelooking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him you are looking for a situation miss he asked yes sir as governess yes sir and what salary do you ask i had a month in my last place with colonel spence munro oh tut tut sweatingrank sweating he cried throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments my accomplishments sir may be less than you imagine said i a little french a little german music and drawing tut tut he cried this is all quite beside the question the point is have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady there it is in a nutshell if you have not you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country but if you have why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures your salary with me madam would commence at a year you may imagine mr holmes that to me destitute as i was such an offer seemed almost too good to be true the gentleman however seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face opened a pocketbook and took out a note it is also my custom said he smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man as i was already in debt to my tradesmen the advance was a great convenience and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before i quite committed myself may i ask where you live sir said i hampshire charming rural place the copper beeches five miles on the far side of winchester it is the most lovely country my dear young lady and the dearest old countryhouse and my duties sir i should be glad to know what they would be one childone dear little romper just six years old oh if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper smack smack smack three gone before you could wink he leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again i was a little startled at the nature of the childs amusement but the fathers laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking my sole duties then i asked are to take charge of a single child no no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he cried your duty would be as i am sure your good sense would suggest to obey any little commands my wife might give provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey you see no difficulty heh i should be happy to make myself useful quite so in dress now for example we are faddy people you knowfaddy but kindhearted if you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you you would not object to our little whim heh no said i considerably astonished at his words or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to you oh no or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us i could hardly believe my ears as you may observe mr holmes my hair is somewhat luxuriant and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut it has been considered artistic i could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion i am afraid that that is quite impossible said i he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and i could see a shadow pass over his face as i spoke i am afraid that it is quite essential said he it is a little fancy of my wifes and ladies fancies you know madam ladies fancies must be consulted and so you wont cut your hair no sir i really could not i answered firmly ah very well then that quite settles the matter it is a pity because in other respects you would really have done very nicely in that case miss stoper i had best inspect a few more of your young ladies the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that i could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal do you desire your name to be kept upon the books she asked if you please miss stoper well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion said she sharply you can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you goodday to you miss hunter she struck a gong upon the table and i was shown out by the page well mr holmes when i got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard and two or three bills upon the table i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very foolish thing after all if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity very few governesses in england are getting a year besides what use was my hair to me many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps i should be among the number next day i was inclined to think that i had made a mistake and by the day after i was sure of it i had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when i received this letter from the gentleman himself i have it here and i will read it to you the copper beeches near winchester dear miss huntermiss stoper has very kindly given me your address and i write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision my wife is very anxious that you should come for she has been much attracted by my description of you we are willing to give a quarter or a year so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you they are not very exacting after all my wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning you need not however go to the expense of purchasing one as we have one belonging to my dear daughter alice now in philadelphia which would i should think fit you very well then as to sitting here or there or amusing yourself in any manner indicated that need cause you no inconvenience as regards your hair it is no doubt a pity especially as i could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview but i am afraid that i must remain firm upon this point and i only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss your duties as far as the child is concerned are very light now do try to come and i shall meet you with the dogcart at winchester let me know your train yours faithfully jephro rucastle that is the letter which i have just received mr holmes and my mind is made up that i will accept it i thought however that before taking the final step i should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration well miss hunter if your mind is made up that settles the question said holmes smiling but you would not advise me to refuse i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for what is the meaning of it all mr holmes ah i have no data i cannot tell perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion well there seems to me to be only one possible solution mr rucastle seemed to be a very kind goodnatured man is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak that is a possible solutionin fact as matters stand it is the most probable one but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady but the money mr holmes the money well yes of course the pay is goodtoo good that is what makes me uneasy why should they give you a year when they could have their pick for there must be some strong reason behind i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if i wanted your help i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me oh you may carry that feeling away with you i assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months there is something distinctly novel about some of the features if you should find yourself in doubt or in danger danger what danger do you foresee holmes shook his head gravely it would cease to be a danger if we could define it said he but at any time day or night a telegram would bring me down to your help that is enough she rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my mind now i shall write to mr rucastle at once sacrifice my poor hair tonight and start for winchester tomorrow with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both goodnight and bustled off upon her way at least said i as we heard her quick firm steps descending the stairs she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself and she would need to be said holmes gravely i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past it was not very long before my friends prediction was fulfilled a fortnight went by during which i frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange sidealley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into the unusual salary the curious conditions the light duties all pointed to something abnormal though whether a fad or a plot or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain it was quite beyond my powers to determine as to holmes i observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end with knitted brows and an abstracted air but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when i mentioned it data data data he cried impatiently i cant make bricks without clay and yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation the telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as i was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down to one of those allnight chemical researches which he frequently indulged in when i would leave him stooping over a retort and a testtube at night and find him in the same position when i came down to breakfast in the morning he opened the yellow envelope and then glancing at the message threw it across to me just look up the trains in bradshaw said he and turned back to his chemical studies the summons was a brief and urgent one please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday tomorrow it said do come i am at my wits end hunter will you come with me asked holmes glancing up i should wish to just look it up then there is a train at halfpast nine said i glancing over my bradshaw it is due at winchester at that will do very nicely then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the morning by eleven oclock the next day we were well upon our way to the old english capital holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery it was an ideal spring day a light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east the sun was shining very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air which set an edge to a mans energy all over the countryside away to the rolling hills around aldershot the little red and grey roofs of the farmsteadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage are they not fresh and beautiful i cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street but holmes shook his head gravely do you know watson said he that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to my own special subject you look at these scattered houses and you are impressed by their beauty i look at them and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there good heavens i cried who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads they always fill me with a certain horror it is my belief watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside you horrify me but the reason is very obvious the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkards blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock but look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester i should never have had a fear for her it is the five miles of country which makes the danger still it is clear that she is not personally threatened no if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away quite so she has her freedom what _can_ be the matter then can you suggest no explanation i have devised seven separate explanations each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us well there is the tower of the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street at no distance from the station and there we found the young lady waiting for us she had engaged a sittingroom and our lunch awaited us upon the table i am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly it is so very kind of you both but indeed i do not know what i should do your advice will be altogether invaluable to me pray tell us what has happened to you i will do so and i must be quick for i have promised mr rucastle to be back before three i got his leave to come into town this morning though he little knew for what purpose let us have everything in its due order holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen in the first place i may say that i have met on the whole with no actual illtreatment from mr and mrs rucastle it is only fair to them to say that but i cannot understand them and i am not easy in my mind about them what can you not understand their reasons for their conduct but you shall have it all just as it occurred when i came down mr rucastle met me here and drove me in his dogcart to the copper beeches it is as he said beautifully situated but it is not beautiful in itself for it is a large square block of a house whitewashed but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather there are grounds round it woods on three sides and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton high road which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door this ground in front belongs to the house but the woods all round are part of lord southertons preserves a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place i was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as ever and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child there was no truth mr holmes in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at baker street mrs rucastle is not mad i found her to be a silent palefaced woman much younger than her husband not more than thirty i should think while he can hardly be less than fortyfive from their conversation i have gathered that they have been married about seven years that he was a widower and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia mr rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother as the daughter could not have been less than twenty i can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her fathers young wife mrs rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse she was a nonentity it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every little want and forestalling it if possible he was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple and yet she had some secret sorrow this woman she would often be lost in deep thought with the saddest look upon her face more than once i have surprised her in tears i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind for i have never met so utterly spoiled and so illnatured a little creature he is small for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately large his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice little birds and insects but i would rather not talk about the creature mr holmes and indeed he has little to do with my story i am glad of all details remarked my friend whether they seem to you to be relevant or not i shall try not to miss anything of importance the one unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at once was the appearance and conduct of the servants there are only two a man and his wife toller for that is his name is a rough uncouth man with grizzled hair and whiskers and a perpetual smell of drink twice since i have been with them he has been quite drunk and yet mr rucastle seemed to take no notice of it his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face as silent as mrs rucastle and much less amiable they are a most unpleasant couple but fortunately i spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one corner of the building for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very quiet on the third mrs rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband oh yes said he turning to me we are very much obliged to you miss hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance we shall now see how the electricblue dress will become you you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue it was of excellent material a sort of beige but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before it could not have been a better fit if i had been measured for it both mr and mrs rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence they were waiting for me in the drawingroom which is a very large room stretching along the entire front of the house with three long windows reaching down to the floor a chair had been placed close to the central window with its back turned towards it in this i was asked to sit and then mr rucastle walking up and down on the other side of the room began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that i have ever listened to you cannot imagine how comical he was and i laughed until i was quite weary mrs rucastle however who has evidently no sense of humour never so much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and a sad anxious look upon her face after an hour or so mr rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in the nursery two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances again i changed my dress again i sat in the window and again i laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense _répertoire_ and which he told inimitably then he handed me a yellowbacked novel and moving my chair a little sideways that my own shadow might not fall upon the page he begged me to read aloud to him i read for about ten minutes beginning in the heart of a chapter and then suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and to change my dress you can easily imagine mr holmes how curious i became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be they were always very careful i observed to turn my face away from the window so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back at first it seemed to be impossible but i soon devised a means my handmirror had been broken so a happy thought seized me and i concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief on the next occasion in the midst of my laughter i put my handkerchief up to my eyes and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me i confess that i was disappointed there was nothing at least that was my first impression at the second glance however i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road a small bearded man in a grey suit who seemed to be looking in my direction the road is an important highway and there are usually people there this man however was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up i lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze she said nothing but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me she rose at once jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter no friend of yours miss hunter he asked no i know no one in these parts dear me how very impertinent kindly turn round and motion to him to go away surely it would be better to take no notice no no we should have him loitering here always kindly turn round and wave him away like that i did as i was told and at the same instant mrs rucastle drew down the blind that was a week ago and from that time i have not sat again in the window nor have i worn the blue dress nor seen the man in the road pray continue said holmes your narrative promises to be a most interesting one you will find it rather disconnected i fear and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak on the very first day that i was at the copper beeches mr rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door as we approached it i heard the sharp rattling of a chain and the sound as of a large animal moving about look in here said mr rucastle showing me a slit between two planks is he not a beauty i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness dont be frightened said my employer laughing at the start which i had given its only carlo my mastiff i call him mine but really old toller my groom is the only man who can do anything with him we feed him once a day and not too much then so that he is always as keen as mustard toller lets him loose every night and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon for goodness sake dont you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night for its as much as your life is worth the warning was no idle one for two nights later i happened to look out of my bedroom window about two oclock in the morning it was a beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day i was standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when i was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches as it emerged into the moonshine i saw what it was it was a giant dog as large as a calf tawny tinted with hanging jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not think that any burglar could have done and now i have a very strange experience to tell you i had as you know cut off my hair in london and i had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk one evening after the child was in bed i began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things there was an old chest of drawers in the room the two upper ones empty and open the lower one locked i had filled the first two with my linen and as i had still much to pack away i was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it the very first key fitted to perfection and i drew the drawer open there was only one thing in it but i am sure that you would never guess what it was it was my coil of hair i took it up and examined it it was of the same peculiar tint and the same thickness but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me how could my hair have been locked in the drawer with trembling hands i undid my trunk turned out the contents and drew from the bottom my own hair i laid the two tresses together and i assure you that they were identical was it not extraordinary puzzle as i would i could make nothing at all of what it meant i returned the strange hair to the drawer and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked i am naturally observant as you may have remarked mr holmes and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head there was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited at all a door which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into this suite but it was invariably locked one day however as i ascended the stair i met mr rucastle coming out through this door his keys in his hand and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round jovial man to whom i was accustomed his cheeks were red his brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his temples with passion he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look this aroused my curiosity so when i went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge i strolled round to the side from which i could see the windows of this part of the house there were four of them in a row three of which were simply dirty while the fourth was shuttered up they were evidently all deserted as i strolled up and down glancing at them occasionally mr rucastle came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever ah said he you must not think me rude if i passed you without a word my dear young lady i was preoccupied with business matters i assured him that i was not offended by the way said i you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there and one of them has the shutters up he looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled at my remark photography is one of my hobbies said he i have made my dark room up there but dear me what an observant young lady we have come upon who would have believed it who would have ever believed it he spoke in a jesting tone but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me i read suspicion there and annoyance but no jest well mr holmes from the moment that i understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know i was all on fire to go over them it was not mere curiosity though i have my share of that it was more a feeling of dutya feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place they talk of womans instinct perhaps it was womans instinct which gave me that feeling at any rate it was there and i was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door it was only yesterday that the chance came i may tell you that besides mr rucastle both toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms and i once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door recently he has been drinking hard and yesterday evening he was very drunk and when i came upstairs there was the key in the door i have no doubt at all that he had left it there mr and mrs rucastle were both downstairs and the child was with them so that i had an admirable opportunity i turned the key gently in the lock opened the door and slipped through there was a little passage in front of me unpapered and uncarpeted which turned at a right angle at the farther end round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third of which were open they each led into an empty room dusty and cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them the centre door was closed and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall and fastened at the other with stout cord the door itself was locked as well and the key was not there this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above as i stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door a mad unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight mr holmes my overstrung nerves failed me suddenly and i turned and ranran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress i rushed down the passage through the door and straight into the arms of mr rucastle who was waiting outside so said he smiling it was you then i thought that it must be when i saw the door open oh i am so frightened i panted my dear young lady my dear young ladyyou cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner wasand what has frightened you my dear young lady but his voice was just a little too coaxing he overdid it i was keenly on my guard against him i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing i answered but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was frightened and ran out again oh it is so dreadfully still in there only that said he looking at me keenly why what did you think i asked why do you think that i lock this door i am sure that i do not know it is to keep people out who have no business there do you see he was still smiling in the most amiable manner i am sure if i had known well then you know now and if you ever put your foot over that threshold againhere in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of a demonill throw you to the mastiff i was so terrified that i do not know what i did i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over then i thought of you mr holmes i could not live there longer without some advice i was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child they were all horrible to me if i could only bring you down all would be well of course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears my mind was soon made up i would send you a wire i put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him free i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning but i must be back before three oclock for mr and mrs rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the evening so that i must look after the child now i have told you all my adventures mr holmes and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means and above all what i should do holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story my friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face is toller still drunk he asked yes i heard his wife tell mrs rucastle that she could do nothing with him that is well and the rucastles go out tonight yes is there a cellar with a good strong lock yes the winecellar you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl miss hunter do you think that you could perform one more feat i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman i will try what is it we shall be at the copper beeches by seven oclock my friend and i the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will we hope be incapable there only remains mrs toller who might give the alarm if you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters immensely i will do it excellent we shall then look thoroughly into the affair of course there is only one feasible explanation you have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber that is obvious as to who this prisoner is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice rucastle if i remember right who was said to have gone to america you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure and the colour of your hair hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also by a curious chance you came upon her tresses the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of herspossibly her _fiancé_and no doubt as you wore the girls dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her so much is fairly clear the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child what on earth has that to do with it i ejaculated my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents dont you see that the converse is equally valid i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children this childs disposition is abnormally cruel merely for crueltys sake and whether he derives this from his smiling father as i should suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power i am sure that you are right mr holmes cried our client a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man we can do nothing until seven oclock at that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches having put up our trap at a wayside publichouse the group of trees with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the doorstep have you managed it asked holmes a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs that is mrs toller in the cellar said she her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug here are his keys which are the duplicates of mr rucastles you have done well indeed cried holmes with enthusiasm now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business we passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar then he tried the various keys in the lock but without success no sound came from within and at the silence holmes face clouded over i trust that we are not too late said he i think miss hunter that we had better go in without you now watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength together we rushed into the room it was empty there was no furniture save a little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen the skylight above was open and the prisoner gone there has been some villainy here said holmes this beauty has guessed miss hunters intentions and has carried his victim off but how through the skylight we shall soon see how he managed it he swung himself up onto the roof ah yes he cried heres the end of a long light ladder against the eaves that is how he did it but it is impossible said miss hunter the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away he has come back and done it i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair i think watson that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy stick in his hand miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him you villain said he wheres your daughter the fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open skylight it is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves spies and thieves i have caught you have i you are in my power ill serve you he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go hes gone for the dog cried miss hunter i have my revolver said i better close the front door cried holmes and we all rushed down the stairs together we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound and then a scream of agony with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door my god he cried someone has loosed the dog its not been fed for two days quick quick or itll be too late holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house with toller hurrying behind us there was the huge famished brute its black muzzle buried in rucastles throat while he writhed and screamed upon the ground running up i blew its brains out and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck with much labour we separated them and carried him living but horribly mangled into the house we laid him upon the drawingroom sofa and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife i did what i could to relieve his pain we were all assembled round him when the door opened and a tall gaunt woman entered the room mrs toller cried miss hunter yes miss mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you ah miss it is a pity you didnt let me know what you were planning for i would have told you that your pains were wasted ha said holmes looking keenly at her it is clear that mrs toller knows more about this matter than anyone else yes sir i do and i am ready enough to tell what i know then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark i will soon make it clear to you said she and id have done so before now if i could ha got out from the cellar if theres policecourt business over this youll remember that i was the one that stood your friend and that i was miss alices friend too she was never happy at home miss alice wasnt from the time that her father married again she was slighted like and had no say in anything but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr fowler at a friends house as well as i could learn miss alice had rights of her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr rucastles hands he knew he was safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it he wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use her money when she wouldnt do it he kept on worrying her until she got brainfever and for six weeks was at deaths door then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beautiful hair cut off but that didnt make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be ah said holmes i think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that i can deduce all that remains mr rucastle then i presume took to this system of imprisonment yes sir and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr fowler that was it sir but mr fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your interests were the same as his mr fowler was a very kindspoken freehanded gentleman said mrs toller serenely and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out you have it sir just as it happened i am sure we owe you an apology mrs toller said holmes for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us and here comes the country surgeon and mrs rucastle so i think watson that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester as it seems to me that our _locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door mr rucastle survived but was always a broken man kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife they still live with their old servants who probably know so much of rucastles past life that he finds it difficult to part from them mr fowler and miss rucastle were married by special license in southampton the day after their flight and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of mauritius as to miss violet hunter my friend holmes rather to my disappointment manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems and she is now the head of a private school at walsall where i believe that she has met with considerable success
